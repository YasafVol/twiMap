    "text": "The inn was dark and empty when the traveller arrived. It appeared suddenly, rising above the gentle hills and valleys of autumnal grass that blew in the wind, green, orange, and even purple in places.\nThe rolling plains were deceptive from afar. At first the many hills and divots seemed gentle, mere waves along a grassy plain. But the closer you got, the more you realized how easy it was to lose your bearings. In the center of a flat stretch of grass surrounded by hills on every side, you could look around and not know where you were. Even climbing a hill, all you might see was a mountain range.\nMountains so vast they disappeared into clouds on all sides grudgingly parted to form a pass connecting the north and south. Cliffs of stone slowly ridding themselves of vegetation and life, rising without end, promising to wall off the world except in this one spot where a gap had been chiseled. No other signs of civilization—at least not without the right vantage point.\nThat was why the inn was such a relief to the lost traveller. It had been placed on one of the highest hills for reasons of safety come spring, but also to act as a beacon. You might catch a glimpse of the roof, sagging in places but still mostly intact, or the chipped paint peeling along some shutters slightly moldy with disuse.\nYet, the inn stood. It had been there for decades, and whilst the other buildings had long since fallen to rubble or been burnt, the inn had been spared. When armies marched, it had been abandoned, then later reclaimed. When undead came flooding across the land, once more the inn had fallen empty. Only, this time, the windows stayed dark. Hopeful travellers stopped looking for anyone at the door, and visitors were rare anyways these days.\nAbandoned, the inn waited. The Skills and care that had been put into the old wood, the magic etched into the bones of this building remained, defying a decade of disuse.\nThat was why the young woman was drawn to it. Not just because it was the first building she’d seen since coming to this world. Because of what it represented.\nShe stumbled through the thick grass, looking over her shoulder with every few panting breaths, but her desperate sprinting had long since turned to weary trudging despite the terror still coursing through her. The young woman smelled of brimstone and fire. She clutched at her right arm, and the t-shirt she wore was charred, as was her arm.\nThe girl climbed the hill, even though there was no light in the windows, not knowing what she might find.\nThe inn. In every world, the inn was a gathering place. Somewhere to meet people, to rest, a point along your travels. Somewhere an epic quest could begin, or where the weary traveller could sit around a warm fire.\nA safe place. But this inn was dark, and the hope faded in the traveller’s chest as she reached the top of the hill.\n“Hello? Is…is anyone…?”\nShe called out as she looked at the dark building. The door was closed, and nothing stirred at her voice. The young woman looked over her shoulder and hesitated.\nWas it still out there?\nShe doubted this place could keep her safe, but the strange land of hills and those impossibly huge mountains were overwhelming. Worse—it was growing dark, and it was going to be a darkness bereft of any artificial light.\nThe idea of staying outdoors with those red-eyed things, or the Dragon, made her shudder. So the young woman pushed the door open and called out again.\n“Anyone here? Hello? I need—”\nShe knew the inn was empty the moment she opened the door. The smell was like that of a library long-abandoned, dusty and moldy—the first wave of stale air made the young woman cough and hack.\n“No. Darn it. Of course it’s empty.”\nAll at once, the traveller sighed and leaned against the doorframe. Her strength ran out of her at the sight of the dark interior, the faint outlines of chairs and tables shrouded in cobwebs and dust proof that nothing had set foot in here for ages. She rested her forearm on the other arm and then winced as the burns screamed at her. Not to be left out, the cuts on her legs throbbed.\nShe tried not to cry. The young woman had known,\nknown\nthe inn was probably deserted when she saw it. She’d known, but hope—\n“It’s not fair. Ever since I came to this world, everything’s been going wrong.”\nTalking helped. Talking made her feel like she wasn’t crazy. The girl looked around.\nThe inn was cavernous, a building meant to hold entire crowds. She felt as small as an ant and unwelcome, like a thief stealing into someone else’s property at night. It was…very dark. Even the fading evening light wasn’t welcome here. A few steps in and the young woman heard her footfalls echoing, then the sound being swallowed. She hesitated. Should she enter?\nInside was darkness, and while it was dusty and she felt like an intruder—the young woman looked over her shoulder.\nShe was hurt. There were things outside.\nMonsters.\nShe’d seen them—they’d nearly killed her!\nMonsters and an unfamiliar world. A world that wasn’t\nhers.\nWhat she was sure was a\nDragon\n, and she had no idea how she’d gotten here. She had no idea how to go back. She had no idea where\nhere\nwas.\n“I just wanted to go to the bathroom.”\nIt was a plaintive whisper. The girl looked back once more and was almost about to back out of the strange inn when she heard the first sounds overhead.\nShe jumped, looked up, sprang out the doorway—and straight into the first wet,\ncold\nraindrops. The girl threw up her hands, gazed up, got a faceful of water, and ran inside as the skies opened up.\nIt began to rain, and the cool air grew colder still. The\npatter\nof raindrops overhead tapped down through the cracks in the roof, dripped down through floorboards, and landed in the dust where they vanished.\nThen it became a roar of sound, and the shower turned the world outside into oblivion. The young woman’s eyes opened wide, and she backed away.\n“No good. I guess—”\nShe found herself inside the inn and gazed about. She coughed again as the dust settled.\nIt was suddenly, unaccountably, peaceful. Despite the onslaught of rain, the young woman realized she might be safe.\nThe fire-breathing lizard-thing probably didn’t like rain, and it was so wet it’d douse even a forest fire. And the little green things with teeth would surely never find her in this! The young woman looked around, and as if a reward had appeared for her surviving all of this, she saw a chair.\nJust a worn, overturned chair, clearly the sufferer of a thousand bottoms. But it invited her. Slowly, the young woman bent down, righted the chair, then began coughing and sneezing again as more dust overwhelmed her. But she brushed the chair off and sat down.\nShe closed her eyes for a moment. Just a moment. She’d rest here to begin with, get her bearings, and then figure out what had happened and why. The adrenaline slowly drained out of her, and Erin Solstice leaned back, trying to get comfortable.\nShe was almost ready to pass out, but a thought nagged at her. She cracked open one eye and looked around. She sighed, opened the other eye, and addressed the empty room.\n“I’m really hungry.”\nAfter a few minutes, Erin Solstice sat back up. The traveller, the first guest of this inn in ages, looked around and rubbed at her eyes.\nNo—not a traveller. She hadn’t been intending to travel anywhere tonight. The young woman frowned as she looked around.\nHow had she gotten here?\nNot just here, as in this abandoned inn, but here—here? She’d been going to the bathroom after finishing a game of chess in her room, in her home, and then…she must have taken a wrong step somewhere.\nIt must have been a\nreally\nbig wrong step, because instead of walking into the bathroom and seeing the comforting sight of porcelain, she’d suddenly found herself in a cave, nose-to-nose with a slumbering—\nDragon.\nErin leapt to her feet, heart pounding. It hadn’t been a dream! She looked around and felt at her right arm.\nThe burns flared up again, and Erin winced.\n“It’s definitely not a dream. But how am I\nburnt?\nI could have sworn it missed!”\nThe jet of violet flame had shot wide of her by a mile, but it had still broiled her right side. Her jeans had kept her right leg from burning as badly as her unprotected arm, but it still hurt. Erin had no idea how she’d dodged, but that had saved her life. She’d run out of that…cave…and then?\nThen she’d found herself running around the rolling valleys and foothills, calling for help and screaming as she realized she was\nnot\nhome. That had been a mistake, because the shouting had attracted attention. Attention, not help.\nA bunch of little green things with red eyes and mouths full of teeth had come after her. They’d slashed at her legs as she ran—still screaming—and lost them.\n“What were those things? G—they sort of looked like—Goblins? No way. This has to be a dream, but my arm hurts too bad for it to be a dream.”\nThat was her paradox. There was no way this was happening. Everything felt real, from the pain to the aching in her feet and tickling in her throat from the dust hanging in the air. However—this was surreal.\n“What is this place? An inn? Really?”\nNow that she looked around, it was clear that a lot of things were wrong. Erin had been in old-fashioned buildings, even to Renaissance faires, but this—this was the real thing.\nThere was no glass on the shuttered windows. She couldn’t see evidence of plastic or anything beyond simple wood or metal fixtures. There was no overhead lighting—and yet it was still very much the common room of an inn.\nThe tables and chairs might be covered with dust and spiderwebs—without any spiders—but there was a bar against the far wall and a staircase leading up. A single room seemed to lead off to another part of the inn, but most of the building was just this vast central space.\nIt should have been lively,\nErin felt. She looked at the bar and imagined someone behind it, polishing a mug and serving a lovely cold drink of—\nErin’s longing sigh was accompanied by a third fit of coughing so long that she actually stumbled over to the door where it was pouring rain to gulp for air.\nThe dust!\nHer third assailant in this world was trying to kill her! Eyes streaming, Erin gulped for air. It was like she was\nbreathing\nthe stuff. She wiped at her face, coughed one more time, sneezed, then glared back at the inn.\n“This place is going to kill me! I’m going to choke to death before the rain stops. Someone should clean it up!”\nShe looked around.\n“…And I guess that someone is me.”\nThe young woman hesitated, but it was clear that if she tried to stay in this place for a few hours, let alone sleep the night, she’d probably attract every monster in ten miles by her coughing alone…if she didn’t suffocate in her sleep.\n“Besides, this would make for a great place to explore from, and it’s got walls. I’m not going to find anything better, I bet. Then I…”\nHer voice trailed off. Erin looked around and felt the unbelievable nature of what had happened building on her.\nDo what? Where am I? What happened?\nShe fought off a wave of panic threatening to engulf her. No—she couldn’t panic. She couldn’t—Erin glanced at the pouring rain. It was muffling anything from outside, but she clamped her mouth shut.\nShe couldn’t scream.\nIt was possible something could hear her through the downpour.\nDon’t scream, don’t panic.\nThink. She wasn’t running for her life. She had to think. So the young woman forced herself to sit down at a table. She faced it, squared her shoulders, and adopted something like a reasonable posture.\n“First things first. I should stay here. I don’t know what’s going on. I don’t know if this inn is\nsafe\n—but it’s dusty. It’s got walls. So I explore. Also, I find something to clean all this stuff up with. I don’t want to use my shirt. Seems like a bad move, but I can’t breathe here without…okay. First steps. Pawn to E4. Pawn to C5. Sicilian Defense. Here we go.”\nAnd with that, she got up and began to explore the inn. The first thing Erin actually did, before even venturing into other rooms, was check her pockets.\nMost people went into their adventures well-equipped or with some nifty object that gave them an edge. Erin checked her pockets and found…nothing. If she’d known she was going to end up in this place, she would have brought along a backpack crammed full of essentials. And a gun. To fight off the little green men and the Dragon.\nBut she hadn’t planned this and, unfortunately, hadn’t even taken a\nphone.\nShe’d been going to the bathroom!\nErin’s forehead wrinkled as she circumnavigated the common room first, checking the tables and chairs for something, anything. All she found was more dust.\nIt had been so fast.\nAll she’d done was step into the bathroom and she’d been somewhere else. No flash of light, no wardrobe—did bathrooms count?\nApparently so, but it had been so sudden she felt like she’d been wronged, somehow. No mysterious voices, just bathroom teleportation. How?\nVirtual reality? Very virtual if so, but it felt too real. No. Then—she was crazy?\nErin hoped not. However, the Goblins and Dragon made her feel there was only one reasonable, unreasonable explanation.\nMagic.\nThis was some kind of fantasy-land. Which meant she probably needed a sword or a wand. Or a magic sword.\nBut it became clear to her that the first thing that Erin needed was…a dustrag. And that became her first mission in this world.\nGet a dustrag and clean yourself a spot to sit.\nIt was proving to be a harder challenge than anticipated. There was nothing in the common room, even behind the bar, aside from a line of very dusty mugs. Erin hesitated before the door adjoining the bar and poked her head inside.\nThe young woman blinked at the semi-familiar sight. It was a kitchen alright; it had cutting boards built into the counters, a bunch of cupboards, and even a stove—a stone stove with a hatch to build a fire, nothing gas or electric.\nThe same for the ovens—she saw a giant, old-fashioned baker’s oven that led up to a presumed chimney. Here, at least, there were actual objects. A pot, cast-iron pan, and a few other utensils, including the world’s rustiest ladle, were all lying next to…\n“Aha!”\nErin found a bucket. It was not a dustrag, but you needed water to clean things, right? And she happened to have a fresh supply coming down right outside.\nShe grabbed the bucket and towed it outside to fill up. After a second, she ran inside and grabbed some of the old mugs she’d found and set them outside to catch more water. She might need it.\nEncouraged, Erin went back to her dustrag hunt. She began opening cupboards in the kitchen, but just found plates, old utensils, what might have been more dust or disintegrated food—\nNothing cloth at all.\n“Drat.”\nErin gave up on her cupboard search and left the rest for later. Did you store dustrags in the kitchen? Maybe with towels, but she needed a pantry. She scoped out the rest of the ground floor but found nothing so handy.\n“Darn.”\nWell, that only left upstairs.\nIt was a very dark stairwell that looked down on Erin as she put her first foot on the stairs. The young woman looked up and gulped. Given the size of the ground floor, the staircase to the second floor was…ominous, to say the least. It looked like the bones of some gigantic monster in the darkness.\nCautiously, Erin ascended. It seemed as though every second stair\ncreaked\nor\ngroaned\nloudly as she placed her weight upon it, and the sounds echoed in the dark inn. To Erin, it felt like she was stepping on landmines—each time she heard a loud\ncreak,\nher heart sped up and caught in her throat.\n“Come on. Come on. You can do this.”\nErin whispered to herself, keeping her voice low so as not to—to wake up anything that might be up there. At that thought, her heart skipped another beat, and she paused halfway up the stairwell, shaking slightly.\n“This is stupid. There’s nothing up there. Nothing!”\nShe paused.\n“Okay, maybe there\nis",

    "text": "something. I don’t know. There could be—more of those Goblins? But there’s probably not a Dragon, right? Right! Don’t be stupid.”\nHesitation. Another step.\n“But a Dragon\ncould\nbe up there.”\nErin took a step back down. The stairs creaked. She scolded herself as her heart thumped painfully.\n“Don’t be stupid. How would a Dragon fit up there? But Goblins?”\nWith a small laugh, Erin gazed upwards. The darkness on the second floor waited for her. Long shadows made the chipped and faded wood ominous. But it was just an illusion, a trick of the mind. She knew there was probably nothing up there. If there were, wouldn’t it have tried to eat her already?\nBut this was a different kind of fear that held her heart. It was a child’s fear, the fear of the dark and the unknown. So, Erin hesitated. But she knew she had to climb.\nAfter a minute, she began talking to herself quietly.\n“Dustrag. Dustrag, dustrag, dustrag…”\nErin muttered the word like a mantra. Somehow, the thought that she\nabsolutely\nneeded to find one gave her the strength to continue climbing the stairs.\nOne step. That was the hardest. Then two steps. Erin’s heart jumped as the stairs\ncreaked\nunderneath her, but nothing terrible happened. So she kept climbing.\nHowever, if the sketchy staircase was the first hurdle of the mind, the empty corridor full of shadows and darkness was an entirely new level of intimidation.\nIt was so dark. Even when her eyes adjusted, Erin could barely see five feet in front of her. But having come this far, she was committed. So she kept going with her heart pounding out of her chest.\n“Dustrag, dustrag, dustrag, dustrag, dustrag, dustrag, dustrag, dustrag, dustrag, dustrag, dustrag…”\nThe first room she came to was very, very dark. Erin crept inside and froze as she heard a sound. Was that…\nrustling?\nNo. No, it was just her imagination. She could hear the storm passing outside with the rain making a racket on the roof overhead. The wind was blowing against the inn, that was all. It was probably just a leaf—\nRustle, rustle\n.\nDefinitely a sound. Erin’s heart played the drums in her chest. There was something in the room with her, and she really hoped for once that it was just a rat. Something—it sounded almost leathery, like two wings unfurling…\n“\nDustragdustragdustragdustragdustra—\n”\nIn the distance, thunder rolled, and a gust of wind blew hard against the inn. Something pale and white unfurled itself in the darkness and flew at Erin. She screamed, flailed wildly at the thing, and crashed to the ground with it in her arms.\nFor a minute, all was confusion and noise. Erin fought wildly against the monster attacking her as rain started pelting her face and it wrapped itself around her arms and head. She eventually threw it off her and scrambled to her feet to find the terrifying creature was—\nA curtain.\nFor a few seconds, Erin just stared at the faded fabric in her hands in complete shock. Once her heart had decided to stop running a marathon, she exhaled.\n“Curtains.”\nShe picked up the pale bit of fabric and studied it. Well, it was a curtain. That was about the extent of her detective skills. It was a white curtain—or at least it had been white a long time ago. Mildew and dirt had turned it grey, but at least it was fabric.\n“Okay, okay.”\nErin’s heart was still racing far too fast. She looked around. The room was still very dark, and the wind coming in from outside made the windows shudder in a\nvery\neerie manner.\nErin closed the window. That stopped the noise, at least. But it was still way too dark to make out many details. Now, she\ncould\nkeep exploring the second floor. Or, having found a dustrag, she could go back down to the bottom floor. The comforting, familiar, dusty ground floor.\nThe room was very dark. Erin took another look around and quickly went back downstairs. She tossed the curtain on one of the tables next to the bucket she’d found and looked around.\n“Let’s see. Where should I start, then?”\nReally, the better question was where\nnot\nto start. Aside from the walls, everything was covered by a thick layer of dust. In the end, Erin started with the table she’d sat at.\nThe wet curtain…rag raised a cloud of dust into the air, making Erin stumble away, coughing and hacking. But the actual task of cleaning was in fact very easy.\nErin took the dustrag, dropped it in the bucket of water, then slapped it over one table. The dull sound made her jump and look around, but nothing moved, so she took hold of the dustrag, dragged it along the table, and took all the dust and pushed it onto the floor.\nThen she did another pass until she could see the wood grain beneath, a dark brown now that night was falling, and squeezed the cloth and dipped it in the bucket once more.\nOne dip turned the water dark grey, but rain meant that Erin had a lot of free water. Ironically, all the dust seemed to have prevented mold or other more clinging stains. A few passes of the dustrag, sending clumps and clouds of dust billowing onto the floor, and the table was mostly clean, if wet.\n“Table’s done! That just leaves—um…”\nErin looked around and began to count the tables—and chairs—and floor—then decided to just clear one more table so maybe she could sleep on top. And maybe a few chairs. And since it was going fast and the rain wasn’t letting up, why not do all the tables?\nEvery time her bucket got so disgusting that it made the rag filthier than when it went in, Erin opened the door of the inn, tossed the water out, and sat back in one of the chairs until the bucket had filled up again. Then she started cleaning once more.\nThere was a rhythm to it. In no time at all, Erin had cleaned the tables, so she decided to clean all the chairs too. And once she’d finished with that, it only made sense to clean the bartop as well.\nThe long counter was made of some kind of high-quality wood. Erin admired the way the faint light from outside made the rich wood glow after removing the dust. The bar was long enough to accommodate at least twenty people at a time…or fifteen if they were picky about elbow room.\nThat done, Erin cleaned the barkeep’s shelf below the bar and the other surfaces in the common room. When she was finished, the inn seemed far warmer than it had before as the newly clean surfaces reflected the fading light from outside.\nHowever, there was one place that Erin had avoided the entire time. Namely, the floor.\nIt was only natural. Erin had nothing like a mop, and she’d been pushing all the dust onto the floor the entire time. As such, huge piles of wet dust clumped together everywhere. Erin kicked at a pile and shrugged.\n“Well, when you compare it with the tables and chairs…”\nShe could only laugh at her strange results. Clean tables, dirty floor. You could eat your dinner off the tables, at least. And who cared about floors? Floors were for stepping on, not sleeping. Erin wiped at her forehead and found she was covered with a layer of sweat. And—was it nightfall already?\nYes, sometime in her cleaning efforts, the rain had ceased and the visible light had decreased until the inn was nearly pitch dark. Now, instead of everything being a mass of shadows, there was nothing to see at all.\n“So it’s not\nscary\n, but terrifying. Great.”\nAt least the ground floor was reassuring. Erin looked around the room, her eyes spotting the moonlight reflecting off the smooth tabletops and chairs. Yes, this room did feel a bit better. She’d cleaned it and thus made it hers, in a way. That made it safe. At least, she really hoped that was the case.\nErin sat back down in a chair and found she was exhausted. She leaned back against the table and sighed. If ever she needed proof that she was terrible in a survival situation, this would be it. Here she was, lost in a terrifying world without a clue where she was, and what was her first move? Clean the room.\n“At least Mom would be happy.”\nErin laughed to herself. She closed her eyes, overcome by exhaustion. Time to rest. Maybe tomorrow, everything would be better. Maybe this was all just a dream. Probably not, but…\nHer eyelids lowered. Her breathing grew slower. Erin just had enough consciousness for one last thought.\n“Now I’m really,\nreally\nhungry.”\n[Innkeeper Class Obtained!]\n[Innkeeper Level 1!]\n[Skill – Basic Cleaning obtained!]\n[Skill – Basic Cooking obtained!]\nIn the darkness, the girl cracked one eye open. She looked around and then sat up.\n“…What was that?”\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "The inn was dark. That was because the world was dark, at least for the moment. Two moons hung in the sky, one light blue, the other pale green. But their soft light was obscured by a shifting layer of clouds overhead.\nHowever, despite the late hour, one figure moved restlessly around the room. A young woman. Her progress left a trail in the dust as she walked. She paced from wall to wall, muttering to herself. Then she tripped over a chair.\n“Ow.”\nErin brushed dust off her pants and t-shirt in disgust. Well, her clothes were officially filthy now. Parts of her t-shirt were burned black, and her jeans had been cut by the Goblins’ knives. But that wasn’t important at the moment.\n“Did I just level up?”\nErin stared up at the ceiling from her fallen position. She could have stood up, but that would have required effort. And besides, Erin was hungry, tired, and confused. Lying on the floor made her feel better. Even if the dust was getting in her hair.\nOrdinarily, that would have been disgusting, but at the moment—\n“Seriously? I leveled up? What is this, a game?”\nSlowly, Erin pulled herself up into a squat. Then she put her head in her hands.\n“No. No it can’t be. But a—a Dragon and Goblins and now leveling…this is another world, right? One like Dungeons and Dragons? Or—or a video game?”\nShe straightened and stood up. The world seemed to be spinning around her. Common sense? Who needed that? Nope. Just hand her a few fire-breathing Dragons and let her level up by cleaning tables. Yeah, that made sense.\n“Right, right. Let’s recap. I’m in another world which is actually a video game. And there are monsters in this world, and I can level up by doing stuff. I even get skills, and when I do, a voice in my head—no, more like a thought appears that tells me I’ve accomplished a task.”\nShe nodded to herself.\n“Yep. Makes complete sense…”\nHer voice trailed off. Erin’s head lowered and then snapped back up.\n“Like\nhell it does!\n”\nErin screamed and kicked a chair hard enough to send it flying into the air. The chair landed with a tremendous\ncrash,\nwhich was satisfying to hear. Less satisfying, though, was Erin’s foot, which had hit the chair hard enough to jam every toe.\nAfter screaming in pain and hopping around a bit, Erin sat at one of the tables and cried for a while. It wasn’t that she liked crying or did it a lot (usually). It just helped at the moment.\nAfter about ten minutes of crying, Erin finally started choking back tears. She felt better, but quickly hit upon another problem when she went to wipe away her tears and snot and remembered there wasn’t any tissue paper nearby. So she used the rag.\nThe wet, disgusting rag. But it was better than her shirt. After that, Erin sat, staring at nothing in particular as the darkness surrounded her.\n“I’m tired.”\nThat was the last thing Erin said before she fell asleep. This time, there were no interruptions.",

    "text": "The next day hit Erin in the face. She groaned and sat up, head aching. Her neck felt twisted, and she was sore from lying on the floor. She still would have slept in longer if it weren’t for the sun and her stomach.\nHobbling around, Erin looked at the bright daylight streaming through one window. She shook her fist at the sunny opening in the wall and glared.\n“This is why drapes were invented, you know.”\nThe window did not respond. Erin sighed. She was already talking to objects. Which was fine! She often cursed her invisible opponents when playing chess on the computer. Or talked to the chess pieces. She’d know she was insane if the window started speaking back.\nWindows. These ones had no glass or curtains. They were square holes in the wall, but they did have shutters. Too bad Erin had chosen one of the open windows to nap underneath.\nWithout thinking, Erin’s hands went up to her head and came back covered in dirt and dust. Oh, right. She’d slept on the floor. The dirty floor where all the dust had gone.\nErin sat in a chair and buried her face in her hands. After a little while, her stomach growled louder.\n“Got it. Message received.”\nGroaning, the young woman eventually stood up. She stood, feeling her body protest the natural law of gravity, and sat down. That felt better, but then her stomach objected. Hunger and exhaustion warred, and hunger won out.\nErin got up, knowing she had to look for food. There wasn’t any in the inn; she hadn’t bothered checking the rest of the cupboards because why should she? Any food that had been around since the inn had been deserted was probably sentient and had legs by now.\nSo that only left the outside. But Erin hesitated as she put her hand on the door to the inn.\nMonsters.\nShe shivered. The memory of yesterday returned, fresh and vivid, and her hands began to shake. Her burned arm flared in pain as the cuts on her legs itched and stung. Erin closed her eyes and took a breath. Yes, monsters. But—\n“I’ll die here if I don’t find something to eat.”\nSo she opened the door. It wasn’t courage that made her do it, just the will to survive.\nThe day was so bright that Erin was blinded for a moment. She walked outside, shading her eyes. And then she stopped. Because a thought had struck her suddenly. Something she had realized but not taken to heart before.\n“This—really is another world, isn’t it?”\nIt wasn’t the Goblins that convinced her. Or even the Dragon. You could imagine that, even if the burns and cuts still throbbed. People imagined aliens all the time. But what couldn’t be imagined, or, Erin thought, even faked, was this:\nThe clouds were too big. Erin Solstice looked up into the sky and realized it wasn’t just the clouds. The sky was too vast.\nThe sunlight was coming from beyond that incredible mountain range she had seen, and even now it had to fight through clouds surrounding those invisible peaks. The sky was so blue it hurt her soul, the kinds of beautiful colors that made her feel like it was a day to be remembered. Yet up, as she craned her head back, she could see clouds, even tiny, pinwheeling birds she could barely make out.\nBut the clouds were just too darn big. It wasn’t something Erin could explain, because she knew clouds were already vast. She had spent hours lying on her back, gazing up at the way a single one had so much depth to it, like a floating island in the sky.\nThese, though…Erin looked at a cloud floating overhead and realized it covered the entire grasslands, the entire basin she stood in, countless miles and the inn in one vast shadow. It was so high overhead she couldn’t understand it. She had seen airplanes flying through the sky, and she was certain that the highest ones she’d ever seen would be flying far below this single cloud.\nIt was larger than the entire plains. It was larger than the inn, a thousand times, ten thousand—a hundred thousand times over.\nErin had visited Chicago, one of America’s biggest cities, and seen it sprawling from both the ground and from planes. You could fit that entire city up there and have more room still.\nErin’s knees shook as she looked up at a cloud the size of an island blowing through the sky. One second the world turned dark and she thought an entire world could be up there, hidden in that beautiful cloud, grey and white blowing across the world.\nThen it passed, and the sun shone down on her and warmed her skin, and Erin knew. She looked around and began breathing again.\nAnother world.",

    "text": "Presently, Erin came back down to earth and realized there was some trickery going on on the ground as well as the sky.\nFor instance, all those hills and valleys? Only now did she realize what an optical illusion they created. From one of the tallest hills, she could finally identify how difficult it would be to see anything from down below.\n“It’s all hills and valleys! No wonder I couldn’t find anything last night!”\nIf you walked carelessly, you could lose track of your surroundings and find yourself in a valley thousands of feet wide. And it was all mostly uniform, only a few flowers and rocks breaking up the tyranny of grass.\nHowever, not green. Erin had to believe it was autumn, here. It had not been in\nher\nworld—to her knowledge, it should have been around the end of July, or August at the latest. She might have forgotten the day. And month. But the grasslands were not the green she expected—instead, the grass was slowly changing color in places, moving from green to orange and even into purple in places. It was yellow running into dusky red in wavy patterns, like bands of color appearing over the landscape.\nIt was beautiful and, perhaps, the first thing to make Erin smile in this world. And it was also a landmark.\nThe plains stretched on and on without pause, which meant that you could easily lose track of where you were. But if she knew that following that band of orange led her close to this inn…\n“Just so long as the grass doesn’t change color overnight, I might have a shot. Looks like it goes purple-orange-yellow and runs\nright\nnext to the inn. So I can follow that back! Follow the purple-orange-yellow grass road!”\nShe laughed with relief. No fear of forgetting that particular pattern of colors, either. There were very similar swathes all around her, but she had a good memory. That was to say, she’d forget what day it was and if she was wearing socks, but she didn’t forget what really mattered. Like chess moves. Or this, she hoped.\nThen Erin realized she could see something else from her vantage point.\nErin stopped as she started to pick out small details on the horizon. Far, far in the distance between the mountain range and the rising sun, she saw what looked vaguely like buildings. No, a wall of stone? Was there a town out there? Or a village? A…city?\nIt was impossible to tell from where she was standing, but the sight of that gave Erin hope that she wasn’t alone in this world. However, just the thought of travelling that far on her empty stomach was impossible, so she kept looking. The next thing that caught her eye made her heart pound with excitement.\n“Are those…trees?”\nErin squinted. There was a small collection of trees in the distance, nestled in one of the valleys. They were trees, weren’t they? Erin felt they looked off—until she realized she was looking\ndown\nat them from her vantage point.\nIt was surreal to feel herself looking down on a forest, but that was the only answer she could think of. It looked like there was a small—well, relatively speaking—valley to the east filled with trees. It didn’t seem too far away, and if Erin looked closely, she could see small specks of yellow and blue on the trees. Fruit?\nThere was only one way to find out. And so she began to walk in that direction, her legs and stomach overriding her cautious brain. She needed food. It wasn’t hard to walk down the gently sloping hills, and although it was less fun to walk back up the hills, at least Erin could do all of it at a meandering walk. The grass was soft under her shoes, and she had good footing. It was…peaceful. Deceptively peaceful.\nIn the back of her mind, Erin remembered the Goblins. Okay, maybe they weren’t Goblins, but what else could they be? They were strange, deformed children that looked like twisted versions of Humans with sharp noses, sharp teeth, little knives, and—\nGoblins. And Erin remembered that they’d found her as she was running, singed and bewildered, from the Dragon.\nShe almost turned around, but she needed food. If worse came to worst, Erin reasoned that she could grab some of the fruit things and run back to the inn.\nThat was the plan. It was the plan right up until Erin found herself walking by a huge rock.\nThere was nothing too important about the rock, except that it was more like a boulder, a gigantic mound of stone rounded at the top like a small hill. It was twice as tall as a normal person and just as long across. In short, it was a big rock.\nHowever, if Erin had thought about it, she might have wondered why a giant rock was right\nhere.\nSuspiciously free of any other small stones and far less craggy and worn down than she might expect. Moss did cling to it in parts, but it was oddly free of any lichen near the base. But she didn’t think about such small details.\nErin ignored the rock completely, only stopping to wonder if it would provide her an even better vantage point to see around her if she climbed up. But she was hungry, so she walked right past it. It was that which saved her.\nAs she put the large boulder behind her, Erin felt the\nwhoosh\nof air and a terrifyingly loud\ncrack\nright next to her ear. She jumped, turned around, and screamed. She dove forwards as the second pincer nearly took her head clean off.\nThe thing that had been hiding underneath the rock lifted it up off the ground and scurried after Erin as she sprinted away. She spared only one glance over her shoulder, but that was enough. She ran even faster.\nTwo large, long pincers made out of a dark brown chitin were poking out from beneath the rock as the crab-monster scuttled towards her. It had lifted the gigantic, hollow shell enough so that Erin could see countless tiny crab legs tearing up the earth as it propelled itself along the ground.\nIt was a crab, but it was all\nwrong.\nTwo long,\ncurved\neye-stalks had appeared—and the giant pincers snapping and trying to tear her to bits. Oh—and it was also taller than a school bus, if not as wide.\nErin didn’t scream as she ran. She couldn’t waste her breath. All the air in her body was devoted to keeping her\nrunning\nas fast as she could as she charged downhill.\nSomething huge missed Erin’s back, but she felt the wind as it passed by. She sped up even faster, but it sounded like it was right behind her. The giant crab was making a sound as it ran after her too, a loud\nclicking\nthat sounded like gunshots going off next to Erin’s head.\nSo she ran faster. She thought she would be dead every next second, but she realized that the loud sounds of pursuit were dying down. Eventually, the clicking stopped, and Erin realized she couldn’t hear anything behind her. She stopped and turned to see a rock with many legs slowly moving back across the plains.\n“What the…holy…crab?”\nErin could only gasp and clutch at her side. She felt like her legs were about to fall off and her lungs were about to burst. She was also lightheaded, but she really didn’t want to sit down.\nInstead, she forced herself to keep walking. It hurt. Everything hurt. But she was still alive, crabs or no crabs.\nErin tried to smile. Her legs ached, but eventually, she got her breathing back under control. And even better, she was at her destination.\n“Is—is that a tree?”\nErin gaped up at the strange plants before her. They were probably trees. They had bark, leaves, and fruit. But in each aspect, they were slightly—off.\nThe tree in front of her was thin beyond belief. It was about ten feet tall, which wasn’t very high for a tree, but the trunk was thinner than she was! And the branches were as thin as Erin’s arms and tapered off to fine points that still held leaves and, apparently, didn’t snap in the wind.\nThe leaves were huge, too. Big, green leaves closer to palm leaves than ones Erin might expect. However, they had that classic leaf shape, not like a maple, and they seemed thick.\nGiven such trees, Erin would have expected to find a bunch of branches from the decent breeze and rainfall of last night. She was used to seeing downed branches from trees in her neighborhood after big rainstorms, but to her vague surprise, she saw almost no leaves on the ground, or branches. Or fruit.\n“Weird. Grey bark, green leaves, blue fruit. Who dropped the paint bucket on this thing? And why is it so…\ntough?\n”\nShe had gone to snap off a low-hanging branch but found that she could barely bend the thin branch, even when she held on with all her weight.\nThe trees were as strong as could be! What interested Erin more than the aesthetics was the edibility of the fruit. And the reachability.\nMost of the blue fruits on each of the trees were clustered around the top branches. There were yellow fruits lower down, but since they were smaller, they were probably also unripe. Hesitantly, Erin grabbed a branch, and after testing her weight on it a few times, tried to pull herself up.\n“I—hate—pull-ups!”\nHer arms shook as she strained to get off the ground. After a few seconds, Erin got her chin above the branch, but no further. After another second, she had to let go.\nErin landed on the ground and stared up at the tantalizing blue fruits, just out of reach. If she weren’t so hungry and tired…she’d still probably never get up that high.\n“Is this how I die? Starving to death because I can’t do a pull-up?”\nNo. That was stupid. But the more Erin thought about it…\n“No. No!”\nErin jumped and managed to pull herself halfway up the first branch through sheer desperation. But her arms gave out, and she fell on her back with a\nwhumph\nthat knocked the air out of her.\n“You…stupid tree!”\nErin’s shouts of frustration echoed in the small valley. She tried to grab the branch again, but she couldn’t even pull herself up anymore. She screamed in frustration, grabbed at her dirty hair, and then kicked the tree.\nThe entire tree shook slightly with the force of Erin’s kick. The leaves trembled, and the blue fruits moved—\nAnd one fell to the ground.\nErin stared at the round, slightly fuzzy blue fruit. Then she looked up at the tree. Without a word, she grabbed the fruit. Then she looked around expectantly.\n“Um, shouldn’t there be some kind of announcement?”\nNo response. Erin kicked the tree again and picked up another fruit.\n“[Mysterious Blue Fruit acquired!] Dun dun dun\ndun!\n”\nAfter a little bit, Erin put her head in her hands to cover her blush.\n“…I hate this world.”",

    "text": "He woke up with a scream, which was hugely embarrassing. When he would inevitably meet his end, the Dragon had resolved himself to go out with dignity befitting his nature.\nHe’d even come up with a speech (then forgotten where he’d put it). Screaming in front of the adventurer or hero was not how he wanted to die.\nBut he couldn’t help it. The sight of someone appearing in front of him? For a second, he’d opened his eyes and thought he was dreaming or…remembering.\nThen the Dragon had realized the young woman was indeed\nreal\n, and she had entered his cave without setting off any of the hundreds—literal\nhundreds—\nof protective spells supposed to warn him or buy him a moment’s time.\nOf course, in the next moment, hundreds of alarms had begun blaring in his ears that his lair was\ncompromised\nand he was about to die.\nSo yes, he’d screamed. Maybe exhaled a bit of flame in shock; if he’d been truly in control of his faculties, the first thing he would have done would be to blow pure Dragonfire at any intruder in the vague hope it would work.\nIt often did. However, in this case, it had been more like…an exhalation of the noblest of gasses in surprise. A tiny tongue of flame which obviously hadn’t been aimed at the young woman as he tried to crawl to safety and fly at the same time, while also activating his emergency teleportation spell. Then he’d crashed into a wall, and by the time he picked himself up, she was gone.\nAn advance scout?\nPossibly a sacrificial decoy. The Dragon knew he was dead in moments if his foes were cunning.\nWho was it? That Necromancer? One of his kin? [Knights]? A random [Hero]?\nHe had no idea. But the Dragon hadn’t wasted time figuring it out. He’d activated his teleport spell and been gone from his lair in moments.\nAt least he’d remembered that. His backup location was far less convenient and arguably far more dangerous—for most people. But as his wealth, his hoard of treasures showered down around him, the Dragon looked around and realized he wasn’t being pursued.\nNot that he didn’t spend the next two days checking every magical channel and re-fortifying his new cave. He didn’t get a wink of sleep. Worse,\nshe\npicked up his contingency [Message] and sent him a dozen questions by spell, asking if he were alright and what had happened.\n“Just a coincidence? An accident? I don’t know, and I didn’t get anything to latch onto. Whomever it is, they’re gone. I—I shall be watchful.”\nThe Dragon snapped back and continued checking for signs of pursuit. But when none were apparent, even two weeks later, he had to then wonder if it\nhad\nbeen an accident.\nAn accident that carried someone into his cave? Maybe some magical…disturbance at the Academy? There were stranger things that had happened. When he replayed his memories, she seemed as surprised as he.\nNaturally, he didn’t put anything to chance and continued fortifying and getting accustomed to his new hideout. He hated the location, the neighbors, and the complications for anyone visiting, but it might be safer.\n“At least, from strange young women appearing out of nowhere. She\nhad\nto have been the subject of—of some chance. Maybe a [Gambler] or whatnot. Otherwise, I would be either dead or have been contacted by whomever it was. It cannot be Demons; they’re far too unsubtle. Who else? If it was the Quarass, I’d be dead. Djinni smell of magic. And that leaves…my kin, who wouldn’t do that.”\nHis brow wrinkled as he tried to figure it out. He truly had no idea. Well, he would keep checking, and if he didn’t sense any pursuit, he might put it down to the random causality of events.\nBesides, he realized that there was one small, small silver lining to this entire debacle. The intrusion into his lair had woken him up, and he feared he wouldn’t sleep for another\nyear.\nBut until he did, he could do some housekeeping.\nGlumly, the Dragon consulted his notes.\n“That time again? Two hundred years already? I might as well. It’s courteous.”\nHe made a huge face and yawned. Distastefully, but there was such a thing as manners. Sullenly, he reached out to the nearest city he could find and made a few arrangements. Then he settled back.\nHe was already dozing by the end of the third day. He was tired. And such obligations as he had left in life? There were very few. The only thing he had left was pride. Pride, waiting for the last young woman or whomever it was to appear. He had a speech…somewhere…\nAnd a few social obligations to uphold. That was all. The Dragon slept once more.\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "The fruit in her hands was blue, probably a fruit, and pretty large. Erin had seen monster apples before in stores, the weirdly expensive ones that were three times as big as their smaller cousins. That was about the size of the blue fruit.\nHer stomach rumbled just looking at it. Erin raised the fruit to her mouth, then hesitated.\n“…Am I going to die?”\nIt was a good question. Erin studied the fruit in her hand. She sniffed it cautiously. It smelled faintly…sweet. She poked it. Tender. Probably succulent. Then she licked the outside.\n“\nPheh!\nHairy!”\nMaybe it would be better to peel it after all. Maybe it was actually some kind of alien monster she was holding, and if she bit it, she’d be eating a mouthful of guts and blood. That thought made Erin hesitate for a few moments before she started peeling it away.\n“It’s like a peach. Not a monster, not a monster…”\nErin peeled off the outer layer of blue fruit and found the inside of the fruit was a purplish-blue. The juice ran to the ground and smelled…Erin’s stomach grumbled, but she’d found something else that caught her attention.\n“That is the biggest seed I’ve ever seen. There’s more seed here than fruit!”\nErin held up the core of the blue fruit, which was indeed a seed core two-thirds the size of the blue fruit itself. The shell was a stained purple-brown, but Erin felt something sloshing about inside when she shook it.\n“Okay, time to see what’s inside.”\nShe’d need a rock for that. Erin transferred the seed core to her other hand and stood up. As she did, she squeezed the core gently.\nCrack. Crack.\nFragile. The brown shell split open and disgorged a mess of pulpy seeds and brown juice onto Erin’s pants and the ground. She stared at the mess in silence until the pungent odor hit her nose—an incredibly powerful chemical smell similar to antifreeze or some kind of cleaning product.\nSlowly, Erin stood up and brushed the seed vomit off her clothes. That did nothing to get rid of the smell, though. Then she picked up the pieces of the seed’s core and hurled them as hard as she could against one of the trees.\n“I\nhate\nthis\nworld!\n”",

    "text": "After a while, her stomach began to growl again as the smell from the seed pod dissipated in the morning air. Hesitantly, Erin grabbed the second blue fruit and brought it to her lips. She had taken care to not get any of the seed pod’s innards on her hands, and she wasn’t about to eat the first fruit.\nShe didn’t know much about herb lore or good fruits or bad ones, but just the smell of the seed core’s innards had convinced Erin it was unwise to try. The actual fruit on the other hand…\nThis time, she bit into the outer skin and chewed. The texture was unpleasantly rubbery and tough to chew, but thankfully it was edible. And what was more—\nThe pure, sugary taste that rushed into Erin’s mouth put her in mind of blueberries. Only—the blue fruit was a bit tougher, so maybe a strawberry? A strawberry that someone sprinkled sugar on and had the taste of blueberries. In short—\n“Wow. This tastes really good!”\nThat was the remark Erin made after she’d consumed eight more of the blue fruits, all in rapid succession. The seed pods she left untouched on the ground, but she happily devoured the outer rinds, stripping an entire tree clean before she was finally full.\nGroaning with satisfaction, she sat back against the tree. She felt good. Sticky and smelly, true, but good. The day was fair and warm, and with her stomach full and the soft grass beneath her, there was only one thought on her mind.\nBathroom\n.\nMaybe it was something in the fruits that triggered it, or maybe it was just long overdue. Either way, Erin was suddenly, keenly aware of a certain need pressing at her. Erin sighed and stood back up.\n“Nature calls. I hate nature.”\nShe walked behind the nearest tree and then around it. There wasn’t much…cover here, but she really had to go.\n“Well, what am I hiding from anyways?”\nErin thought about that for a moment then deliberately edged around the trunk until the sun was out of view. That made her feel better.\nA few seconds later, Erin felt refreshed and happy. Her stomach was full, other parts were empty, and best yet, she was alive.\n“Now, how am I going to get back past that crab rock-monster?”\nErin’s stomach twisted unpleasantly at the thought, and her heart began to pound in her chest.

    "text": "The large, duplicitous rock seemed more and more out of place the more Erin looked at it. If she’d been able to think past her hunger before, she’d have wondered how such a large stone made it all the way to the grasslands without being eroded by the elements. Well, that stupid crab-creature was clearly one of the predators in this world.\nAnd it was quick. Erin didn’t want to run away again, so she\nreally\nhoped this plan of hers would work. Did crabs have noses? Probably not, but she really hoped they could still smell.\nSlowly, Erin walked forward. The rock remained motionless. Well, that was fine.\nErin picked up a small stone and hurled it at the rock. It bounced off.\nShe waited. The rock didn’t shift so much as an inch.\nErin picked up another, larger stone and threw it against the rock. She wasn’t a good shot, so the rock glanced off the side. Again, there was no response.\n“Uh, is…is this the right rock?”\nErin looked around. No other suspicious large rocks in sight. But it wasn’t doing anything.\n“Get closer…no, that’s stupid.”\nShe eyed the rock again. Well, if it wasn’t going to move…\nErin turned away. She’d circle around.\nFar\naround. She began walking away.\nClick.\nIt was such a small sound. But it made her freeze and then whirl around.\nErin caught the rock crab crawling towards her stealthily. In just a few seconds, it had covered nearly twenty feet. She stared in horror as it reared upwards.\nClickclickclickclickclickclickclick—\nThe rock crab began its high-speed shuffle towards her. Two enormous claws and a pair of dark eyes curled up from underneath the rock again.\nErin stepped back, half-turned to run, and remembered what was in her other hand. She took swift aim and threw the seed pod she had been holding.\nBullseye.\nThe seed core smacked the rock crab right on the antenna and burst into a shower of pulpy liquid. Even at this range, Erin could smell the toxic odors on the breeze.\nIf she were honest, Erin didn’t know what she expected. Pain or shock from the rock crab, maybe. She’d nailed it pretty good on the antenna, and she was sure that had to hurt. But still, it wasn’t as if the seed cores were that heavy. She expected the crab to recoil and maybe get scared off by the scent at best.\nWhat she\ndidn’t\nexpect was for the crab to freak out and start smashing itself with one of its claws. It was panicking, frantically scraping away at the spot she’d struck with the seed core, ignoring the damage it was doing to its own antenna. At the same time, the rock crab was making distressed sounds.\nIt sounded like the loudest cricket in the world, only a lot deeper and echoing out from beneath the rocky shell the crab was wearing. That was enough to make Erin back up until she was back among the trees and the crab was barely visible.\nEven after she’d gone a ways away, she could still see the crab doing an unhappy dance as it tried to scrape off the seed pod fragments.\n“Huh.”\nErin scratched her head.\n“Well, it’s good to know they hate fruit.”\nSpeaking of which…Erin decided to get more of the delicious blue fruits. As many as she could carry, in fact. Blue was now the color of breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and she only wished she had more hands. Could she make a basket somehow…? Out of grass?\nShe kicked at a tuft of the stuff.\n“…That’s a stupid idea.”\nHow about her shirt then, or pants? But that was a bit…well, there was no one around to see her except the rock crabs, right? Even so.\n“Too bad I’m not a streaker, huh?”\nErin addressed that comment to a nearby patch of grass. The grass said nothing in reply.\nWith a sigh, Erin walked away. She slowly crested a small hill and found herself looking down on the fruit orchard once more.\nShe also found herself looking at several short, green creatures that had appeared in her absence. They were kicking trees and harvesting the blue fruits that fell to the ground.\nThey were instantly familiar to her, of course, but the transfixed Human got a good look at them again. They were short, four feet tall at most, possibly even shorter. Almost like children, although their heads were too big.\nThat was because of all the teeth. But they wore ragged loincloths and were grunting and poking one another. Erin saw pointed ears, scabs from some healing wounds, and as one glanced up and saw her and froze—she saw two crimson, glowing eyes.\nFor a few seconds, they didn’t see her. Then one of them looked up and saw the slack-jawed Human staring their way. He made a shrill noise, and the others looked around.\n“G-goblins?”\nThe nearest creature took a step towards her. He looked harmless. For a moment. Then he bared his incredibly sharp teeth and drew a knife. His friends did likewise. They advanced on the young woman.\nThe young woman, for her part, stared in horror for two more seconds and then pointed one finger. She opened her mouth and screamed.\n“\nGobliiiiiiiiins!\n”\nThe green-skinned monsters stopped and stared as the young woman screamed and took off, running at top speed. But they followed her doggedly despite the insane speed at which she sprinted. These Goblins had learned to hunt other species and knew that Humans panicked easily and grew tired. They’d catch her as soon as she slowed down.\n…Assuming she ever slowed down.",

    "text": "Erin found a stream running down a hill a few hundred feet away from the inn. Its position and relative size meant it was the perfect place for her to gather water or even wash herself should the need arise. All things considered, it was an idyllic windfall of a discovery.\nShe took three steps, leapt, cleared the stream in one jump, and hit the ground running. The stream kept flowing as she left it rapidly behind. Not once did Erin look back, although her throat was burning.\nShe was still being chased.\nBy Goblins. They swarmed after her, wading through the stream despite the strong current. And though they were small, their bodies were wiry and their dirty arms muscled. And they all carried weapons.\nGenerally, they wore daggers or short swords, but Erin had spotted what looked like a meat cleaver on one of them. She was too busy running to get a good look, but if they were like the ones she had met yesterday, the weapons were rusty, stained with dried blood and crusty substances, and sharp.\nThat, combined with the Goblins’ faces, made them terrifying. Normal Goblins were supposed to look ugly, but not dangerous. In video games, Erin had always seen them depicted as short, man-like creatures with beaky noses, pointed ears, and ugly faces. But these Goblins…\nPointy ears? Check.\nUgly face? Check.\nTheir noses weren’t too pointed, but they were definitely carrots compared to potatoes as noses went. But what really scared Erin were their teeth.\nThey had two rows of teeth. Like sharks. They had blood red eyes, like monsters in nightmares. Glowing red eyes. And they screamed as they chased her.\nIt didn’t sound like normal screaming. Erin was used to hearing screams, but they only came out of Humans. The sound the Goblins made wasn’t a continuous sound but a kind of ululating noise that seemed to grow louder the longer they yelled.\nYiyeyiyeyiyeyiyeyiyeyiyeyiyeyiyeyiyeyiyeyiyeyiyeyiyeyi—\nIt made Erin break out into a cold sweat, and she pumped her legs even faster to charge up the hill. She was in one of the valleys, but she knew she was headed straight for the inn. She just had to get there and, and—\nThat’s where they’d kill her. Erin would get to the inn, and they’d surround it, break in somehow, and tear her to shreds. But what other choice did she have? None. She couldn’t run forever.\nAlready, Erin felt like someone was twisting a knife into her side, and she was gasping for air. She was no athlete. The only reason she was still ahead of the Goblins by a good bit was because they were short. She also guessed they were letting her use up all her energy before closing in for the kill.\nErin crested the hill, stumbled, caught herself, and saw the inn’s dark brown walls only a hundred feet away. She dashed towards it, throwing all of her energy into a desperate sprint.\nThe Goblins’ voices had faded a bit by the time she burst through the inn’s doorway and slammed it shut. But she knew they were only minutes away at best, so Erin stood up despite the agony in her chest and legs.\nThe door had a metal bar that could be slid to prevent it from being opened. Erin did that and then looked around. Windows. The common room had so many\nwindows\n.\n“Oh, you’ve got to be—”\nShe didn’t waste time on the rest of her sentence. Erin dashed over to one window and slammed the wooden shutters closed. Then she fumbled with the latch. It was a cheap bit of metal, but it might buy her a few seconds.\nErin sped around the room, fighting to close the windows as the Goblins’ shouting grew louder and louder. She slammed shut the last window and let out a huge sigh of relief. Then she remembered that the inn had a second floor.\nThe mysterious darkness of the second floor that had terrified Erin the night before didn’t even slow her steps as she dashed up the stairs. She ran in and out of each room as fast as she could, closing windows. While some of the mantles had succumbed to the rot, all of the shutters were mostly intact. She’d hear if they were being smashed in, at least.\nErin ran into the room at the end of the corridor and stopped when she saw the skeleton in the last bed. But even that didn’t slow her much, and she closed the windows just in time to hear the Goblins start pounding on the door downstairs.\nThey didn’t get in that way. But as Erin sped down the stairs, she heard one of the shutters break. And then another.\nThe first Goblin squeezed through a window as Erin stood petrified. The second and third were right behind him.\nErin backed up. The first Goblin came at her as his fellows spread out behind him. There were five—no, seven of them.\nHer legs were shaking. Erin tried to turn over a table, but the Goblin was too quick. He lunged forward, and she fell backwards with a small scream. He laughed and jumped for her, knife swinging.\nErin rolled backwards and felt a stinging cut on her leg. She scrambled to her feet and looked down.\nBlood. It ran down her leg from the cut in two wavy lines. She looked back at the Goblin and saw his grinning face.\nIt was a similar grin. Or smile. Or expression, really. But to Erin, it was the same face. The same as a Human’s. Mocking. Confident. The kind of face young men—\nHe licked at the blood on his knife. Erin’s face froze. The fear that had been bubbling inside her turned in an instant to anger. The Goblin didn’t notice and ran for her, still grinning.\nErin’s leg shot up. She didn’t kick. It was just a lightning-fast shot right between the legs. She could have sworn she heard something\ncrunch\n.\nThe Goblin’s face, which had been so full of malicious glee, froze up. He turned pale, made a high-pitched keening sound, and toppled over.\nThe other Goblins stared in shock at their friend. Erin stared in shock too, but had the presence of mind to grab a chair before they could react. She raised it threateningly.\n“Well? Come on!”\nErin swung the chair like a club. The Goblins ducked underneath it and advanced on her, swinging low.\nA lucky blade slashed Erin’s leg, and she cried out in pain. Instantly, she brought the chair up and over her head and smashed the Goblin flat.\nIn movies, the chair would break off, leaving Erin with the stumps in her hands. In reality, the impact made her hands sting, but the chair didn’t so much as creak. The Goblin, on the other hand, screamed a lot.\nHis fellows backed up as Erin held the chair up for another swing. Her leg was bleeding badly from the cut, but she was more mad than scared at this point. Plus, she had a chair. All they had were knives.\nIn fact, she had more than one chair.\n“Eat this!”\nErin tossed the chair at one Goblin and clipped him on the head as he ducked. He fell down too, and meanwhile, Erin had grabbed another chair. She used it like a shield, jabbing the legs at the nearest Goblin and forcing him back.\nFaced with an unexpected threat, the others split up and tried to circle around Erin. Accordingly, she tried not to let them. But even if they were surprisingly fragile, they were quick and hard to hit. Before long, the remaining four Goblins were all around Erin, peering under tables, feinting at her from behind unheld chairs.\n“Get back!”\nErin tossed her chair again and, again, missed. But as the Goblins ducked, she turned around and fled for the stairs. She had longer legs, but they were quick too and surged after her as she jumped up the stairs two at a time.\nThe fastest Goblin was hot on her heels, cackling with that strange laughter as he swiped at the back of her legs. Erin ignored the bleeding and hit the top of the stairs with the Goblin right behind her. He laughed evilly.\nAnd stopped when he realized it was just him and the Human female at the top of the stairs. He looked up. The\nbig\nHuman female made a fist.",

But she was\nprey.\nPrey didn’t fight back!\nOne threw a knife. It hit Erin in the stomach point first, but the toss was so weak it barely penetrated her skin. She ignored it and leapt down the stairs.\nTwo hands on the handrail let Erin swing her legs up. She was no gymnast, but rage gave her a moment of athletic inspiration. Both her feet crashed into the face of the knife-throwing Goblin.\nHe screamed and clutched at his broken, bleeding nose. His two friends ran back as Erin landed on the ground. The bleeding Goblin waved his knife at Erin. She slapped him.\nCrack.\nIt was a good slap, the kind that made Erin’s hand go numb. The Goblin fell down, stunned, and his hand let go of his knife.\nErin stared at it. Then, before the other two Goblins could move, she grabbed it. And when she stood up, she had a very different expression on her face.\nThe remaining Goblins looked at her. They weren’t just two, not really. Their friends hadn’t been knocked out, just hurt. Already, they were getting up while clutching their bruised heads and bodies. However…\nThe Human female was facing them, knife in hand. She didn’t look as frightened as she had been before. In fact, she looked quite angry. That wasn’t good. She seemed suddenly bigger, and the Goblins were keenly aware that she had just beaten two-thirds of their number in a matter of seconds.\nAnd she had a knife.\nThe Goblins stared at Erin. She stared back. Now they were all awake and upright, but they didn’t seem to be about to attack. In fact, they seemed sort of nervous.\nErin stared at them. They stared at her. Her eyes began to water, but she didn’t dare blink. But she had to do something, right?\n“\nBoo!\n”\nThe Goblins shrieked and ran. They crashed out of the broken windows and ran as if pursued by demons.\nErin stayed where she was for quite some time, hands still half-raised. Eventually, she lowered them.\nShe wanted to scratch her head, but nearly stabbed her eye out with a knife. Carefully, Erin put the knife on a table and then sat in the nearest chair. Her legs had lost all strength.\n“Ha. Haha.”\nErin coughed and then chuckled again.\n“Hahaha.”\nHer chest hurt. Her arms hurt. Her legs hurt. Actually, her entire body hurt. She felt like she was dying. But.\n“I can’t even laugh properly right now. Hahahahahaha…ha?”\nAnd then she did laugh. She started laughing as she sat with her back against the table, bleeding onto the inn’s dirty floor. She laughed and laughed until tears were in her eyes. And as she closed her eyes, she smiled. Then she bumped her cuts and stopped smiling. But she still slept.\n[Innkeeper Level 4!]\n“…Hey. What happened to levels 2 and 3?”",

    "text": "The last of the Goblin warriors fled the fearsome Human in a rush. It had only been seven of them in total, hardly an actual raiding group even for their tiny tribe.\nEven so—seven Goblins versus one Human without a weapon? They\nshould\nhave killed her. That they hadn’t was bad.\nBad for many reasons that even the littlest Goblin, crouched and watching the inn from afar, could understand. She and two others were so small and young that they weren’t even warriors; her weapon was a basket, and it had been full of blue fruits until the chase.\nDeadly, dangerous blue fruits that could kill you foaming-mouth-dead. But they were so hungry, the Goblins would take that risk. They were so hungry, eating Human sounded good.\nAnd now they were hungry, hurt, and embarrassed. The Goblins snarled as they limped away. They didn’t talk to the littlest Goblin, just grunted and pointed and made the smaller ones get their baskets and go back for actual food they could take back to the tribe.\nThe little Goblin ducked a swat from one holding his crotch and fled. She didn’t know the name of Injured Crotch, but that was now his nickname in her mind. Goblins didn’t have names. Only their [Chieftain] had any real title, and he was scariest of all.\nThe seven Goblin warriors were so irate at their loss they jabbed the smaller Goblins to\nhurry up\nuntil they got back to the trees. Then they sat down, tried to rub dirt or spit onto their injuries, and pointed with huge growls at the trees.\nThe little Goblins had to kick the trees and collect the fruits. The smallest one was so hungry she took a bite from the sweet blue fruit and got hit again by one of the older Goblins. He snarled. She wasn’t allowed to eat here! He kicked the blue fruit away savagely and gestured emphatically to hurry up.\nThe Goblin warriors were looking around—nervously. The giant thing that hid under rocks might come back. Or something else seeking to kill Goblins. Which might be…anything.\nThe little Goblin\nsniffed\nas she covered her head, but grabbed as many ripe fruits as she could. Then she had to run with the basket back to their tribe.\nTheir tribe was a lot of Goblins in a cave. It was small, so narrow you had to roll under a rocky opening and crawl forwards until it grew tall enough to stand.\nThere was no light here except a few cracks in the ceilings, but the little Goblin could still see just fine. It was wet here after all the rain, and it smelled of poo.\nBut it was safe from big monsters and other things. Even if the [Chieftain] sometimes got stuck going in and out, this place was far safer than outside.\nThe little Goblin had no idea when the tribe had gotten here. Nor why they were here. She was only…young. No one explained things to her. The older Goblins mostly hit her and made her do things. That was how they were taught, but the little Goblin thought she was seven sticks, three rocks, and two leaves old.\nShe’d been counting. But she didn’t know numbers above ten. The only Goblin so wise, who could even speak words and\nread\nthem, was the [Chieftain].\nHe was mad again. He sat, twice as big as any other Goblin, snarling at anyone around him while he waited for a smoky fire to warm a bit of food. The littlest Goblin’s stomach growled as she saw it.\nA dead deer.\nThe [Chieftain] had found food! All the Goblins were watching hungrily, but the [Chieftain] would eat first. Then, the little Goblin hoped, there would be at least bones, but possibly some hot meat.\nThe fruits were placed next to the deer carcass, but the [Chieftain] snarled and kicked the fruits away. The Goblins were made to take them\naway\nfrom the precious meat and remove the little bad things.\nThe small Goblin had no idea why, only that it was bad. Bad-death. She wished…someone would explain. But only the [Chieftain] knew.\nHe had taught them numbers. So he could tell them to get ten blue fruits each. Learning to count was amazing. The little Goblin had counted teeth, flies, Goblins—until the [Chieftain] kicked dirt at her.\nBut then she’d been counting days she’d been awake and realized she didn’t have more than ten, and she had been awake more than ten days, right?\nIt had been a big puzzle. So, to forget her hungry, rumbling stomach, the littlest Goblin with no name sat in her sleeping spot and looked at her big idea.\nShe counted one thing with leaves. Then, when she had ten leaves…she put down a rock instead. And that meant\nten leaves.\nAnd if she had ten rocks, that meant it was now a stick. Paradoxically, she had decided grass was bigger than a stick by ten again, even though blades of grass were smaller in size than sticks. Otherwise she’d lose track of all the itty bitty pieces of grass that could get blown around. She had not needed a piece of grass yet, but she was looking forwards to getting a nice purple stem to count with.\nThat was how she thought she’d seen seven sticks, three rocks, and two leaves of sun. She’d counted backwards to figure that out, but she thought it made sense. The rains had been falling a lot when she was born, and they fell regularly. At least—they had twice already, after it got really cold.\nThe cold.\nThe little Goblin shivered. That would be a bad time. It was wet now, but it could get wetter. And she was hungry. She looked back and saw that the tribe was eating. She sprang up and ran forwards, but there were only scraps already, and so she had only a single mouthful of bloody meat and half a fruit.\nThis was the little Goblin’s life. She sat, listening to her [Chieftain] growling, an echo of her tummy. She curled up as he demanded to know why his warriors were hurt.\nThey didn’t tell him. And the other Goblins didn’t either because the [Chieftain] would be very mad to know they’d let a single Human live. So he just hit them and made them look for more things to eat.\nThe little Goblin sat there and watched the [Chieftain] out of the corner of her eye. He sat there, a scowl on his face. Angry. Always angry. But the other Goblins were like that. Angry. Or they woke up and slept and ate.\nShe didn’t know why, but they were missing something. When, rarely, they stole something very nice like the colorful water, the [Chieftain] would get happy and then angrier still, or quiet. And he would do what no other Goblin did and talk. And he would say there should be more Goblins. A bigger cave. And the Goblins would listen to him until he scattered them with a fist or one of his great weapons, an axe made out of bone.\nHe spoke for the first time in two rocks and one grass as the little Goblin listened. Two words. The [Chieftain] looked around and growled as he wiped blood and spat fur from his mouth.\n“Need [Shaman].”\nBut what that was, the little Goblin had no idea. And he said nothing more, so she went back to counting the steps to the blue fruit trees with her grass and rocks. She thought of the strange Human in the big wooden thing. And she wondered if that meant anything different would happen.\nLess blue fruits to eat, probably.\nAmentus Fruit (Blue Fruit) Trees\nby\nEnuryn\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "The next morning, the young woman sat in a chair and pondered. It seemed stupid. No, it was stupid. But there could be only one explanation.\n“When you level in dreams, you level in real life?”\nErin thought about that for a moment.\n“Huh.”\nShe sat in the chair for a few more minutes. Those minutes turned into half an hour and then nearly a full hour before her stomach grumbled.\n“Right, food.”\nAfter another hour, Erin decided to get up. Her body protested the movement, but her stomach overruled her legs. She got up and reluctantly stumbled out the door.\nHer legs hurt. As she stepped outside, Erin felt at the back of her legs and winced.\n“Right. Knife cuts.”\nShe should wash those. If she had water. But since she didn’t and the wounds were already scabbed over, Erin left them and started walking.\nIt was a long, long walk back to the fruit trees. Erin was only glad she remembered where they were. She was even gladder that there weren’t any suspicious rocks along her route, but that only made her warier. Could they burrow? Were there grass crabs?\nIf there were, they didn’t seem interested in her at the moment. Erin found the strange, spindly trees easily and picked an armful of blue fruits. She was glad they were bountiful with the blue orbs, and gladder still the Goblins hadn’t stripped them bare. But it was a veritable orchard here, so she gathered as many as she could.\nErin sat and ate fourteen. It wasn’t that she was hungry so much as\nreally\nthirsty. She sucked as much of the blue juice out of the fruits before gathering as many as she could carry and walked back to the inn. The seed cores she left where they lay.\n…Actually, now that she thought of it…\nErin doubled back and grabbed two seed cores and placed them carefully on top of her stack of blue fruits.\n“Just in case. I should also get a bow and arrow or something, right? Too bad I have no idea how to shoot anything. Or have any idea how to carve a bow. You carve bows, right?”\nErin thought about that as she walked back over the sloping ground, taking care not to trip and break the seed cores. How\nwould\nshe make anything, anyways?\n“Um. Is it three bars of iron and two sticks to make a pickaxe? Or can I make a wood sword by punching trees? Why couldn’t this be Minecraft instead?”\nBut now that she thought of it, Erin remembered the trees.\n“Firewood. If I could cut the wood away, that is.”\nShe thought of the incredibly stiff branches.\n“…Nope. But wait a second. What about fallen branches? Or—”\nShe turned around and started walking back. But again, she found no detritus from the tough trees anywhere in the orchard.\n“Weird.”\nFrustrated, Erin kicked a tree and dodged another falling blue fruit. She added it to her armful and walked back to the inn.\nThe room was still a mess from last night’s fight. Erin set the fruits down on one table and started righting chairs and tables.\n“Stupid Goblins.”\nShe paused as a thought struck her. Goblins. Oh yeah. She’d fought Goblins.\nHer eyes fell on the knife she’d taken from one of them. Slowly, Erin’s legs folded up, and she sat on the dusty ground again. Then she sneezed.\n“Dusty. This is stupid.”\nShe got back up and looked around. Where was it? There.\n“Dustrag. Let’s do this.”\nErin got down and began sweeping up the dust on the floor. It was difficult since she had to move all the tables and chairs out of the way, but it gave her something to do. She only had a small, dirty rag anyways after cutting the curtain into easier-to-use parts, so she was mainly doing it to think. Her mouth was terribly dry, but Erin started working. She had to focus.\n“Goblins.”\nErin stared at the waves of dust as she scrubbed.\n“Seriously. Goblins.”\nShe shifted two tables aside and pushed the dust out of the way.\n“…With shark teeth. That’s messed up.”\nErin thought about that.\n“But I won.”\nShe amended the statement instantly.\n“Barely. They’re not that dangerous. They’re like kids. And I can beat up tons of kids even with knives. If I’m careful.”\nNot that she was going to make a habit of that! Just Goblins. She could fight them off. Then Erin reconsidered again.\n“Unless they stab me in my sleep. Or there are lots of them. I’m probably safe if I make sure they can’t get in without me hearing it. I should block every way in but have, like, an escape window.”\nShe’d have to remember to do that. Then she’d be forewarned and could hold them off or run; they didn’t seem as fast as she was. So she was reasonably safe from them? Erin bit her lip.\n“There’s the rock-crab-thing. Does it eat Goblins?”\nWas she safe in here from\nthat\nthing? It couldn’t fit through the door, but could it knock down the walls? Probably not.\nSo, as far as she knew, the inn was reasonably safe if she took precautions. What about leaving it? The Goblins—a memory nagged at her. They’d been carrying baskets. Which meant…\nThey hadn’t gone hunting for her.\n“They were eating the blue fruits. So they live nearby.\nWonderful.\nI’m going to run into them again. Which means I need a weapon. Great.”\nErin stopped and put her face in her hands. She immediately regretted that decision.\n“\nPheh!\nDusty.”\nShe sighed and grabbed the rag. Time to clean up some…more?\n“Uh. What happened to the dust?”\nThe floor of the inn was made out of floorboards. Very sensibly, and in keeping with the rest of the inn, which was also made out of wood. However, Erin had never seen the floor before. Up till this very moment, it had been covered by a thick layer of dust.\nThere had been so many clumps of dust rabbits it had been more like a dust sea, and a disgusting one at that. Erin had left a trail every time she walked across the floor, hence her desire to get rid of it. A task that would surely take at least two days given the size of the inn and her tool of choice, a rag instead of a broom or mop.\nNow though, she was staring at the floor. A clean, dustless floor. Erin gazed down and then stared some more. Then she looked at her hands.\n“Was that me?”\nIt must have been, but how had she done it? Of the numerous and varied—of the few talents Erin possessed, cleaning was not one of them.\nOh sure, she could clean up spills and small messes. Anything that involved tossing water and mopping stuff up was okay. But this?\n“I wasn’t even dusting for more than—an hour? Two? And it’s all clean.”\nErin scuffed at the floor and amended that thought.\n“Sort of clean. You couldn’t eat your dinner off it, I guess. But that’s why we have plates.”\nAnd it was a definite upgrade from before. Distractedly, Erin scratched her head and felt the caked dirt and dust on her face start to crumble away.\n“The floor is clean. I am not.”\nErin stared at the floor again and felt hot, sweaty, and very dirty. She felt like she was forgetting something, but she was so\nhot\n—she was dehydrated! And as soon as Erin realized that, she realized how thirsty she was.\n“Right. I need a drink.”\nWater, preferably. But Erin would have killed for a nice, cool drink of anything, really. Too bad there wasn’t any water nearby. More blue fruits? Why hadn’t she kept that bucket of water from when it had been raining? Instead, she’d used it to clean tables! Erin groaned, but she knew she couldn’t waste time on recriminations. She looked around and came to a realization.\n“Time to find some. Or I’ll die. Whichever comes first.”\nErin wandered out of the inn. After a minute, she walked back in, grabbed the knife, and closed the door behind her as she left. After another minute, she walked back in and threw the dustrag on the ground. She slammed the door as she left this time.",

    "text": "“It’s really hot.”\nErin stumbled through the grass, looking around blearily every few steps. Her mouth felt dry and nasty. She had a headache, and she felt sweaty and gross. But what was really on her mind was water.\n“Water. Water is water. Because water. Where’s the water?”\nErin walked for a few minutes in one direction and saw no water. So she turned left and started walking that way. Then she doubled back around and sat down. Her head felt…thick. And she was so unwell she sat there for a long time until she felt she had to get up.\nShe was so thirsty, and that overrode the throbbing feeling in her mind.\n“I could drink a Gatorade. Or a Pepsi. I like Coke too, though. What about Pepsi and Coke and Gatorade? Gatorpepcoke? Pegatoroke?”\nIt occurred to her that she wasn’t making much sense. Even for her, that was. Erin looked around for the water and felt her head spinning. Her head was really starting to hurt.\n“Cogapeptorade?”\nHer foot slipped. Or maybe she stumbled. But suddenly, Erin tripped and had to spin around to keep her balance. That was so much fun that she started spinning around as she walked. She stopped after a few seconds and tried not to vomit.\n“Feel sick.”\nShe wiped her brow. At least she wasn’t sweating. It was really hot, though. Weird.\nShe really needed to sit down in the shade. But there wasn’t any to be found, at least not where she was. Maybe if she lay down she’d feel better?\nErin went to bend over. Halfway down, she remembered.\n“The stream!”\nShe tried to stand up and nearly fell flat on her face.\n“Where—where was it?”\nHead spinning, Erin looked around. The inn was still visible.\n“It was there. So if I’m here…there?”\nShakily, Erin began stumbling towards where the stream was.

    "text": "The stream was far deeper than Erin had thought. Deep enough for her to sit up to her shoulders in water along the edge. It was also cold. Erin had thought she knew pain when, in the delirium of waking up, she’d turn on the shower and realized she’d hit the cold water on full blast.\nThat was nothing to this stream’s chill. It was probably mountain runoff, and so it was one step above freezing. Erin’s teeth were chattering, and the fast-moving current meant that there wasn’t even a body of water to warm up in time.\nIt wasn’t even numbingly cold, which was too bad.\n“B-being numb would be better than being really cold.”\nBut it was water, and it was making her clean. And the longer she sat, the warmer Erin felt. That was probably because her body was freezing up, but she didn’t care.\nErin ran her hand through her wet hair and sighed. She’d scrubbed hard, but without soap or shampoo, what could you do? And when she thought about how she hadn’t used a toothbrush in days…yuck.\nAt least the inn was clean, now. And since she was no longer actively dying of thirst, Erin had figured out how she’d done it so fast.\n“Hm. So, [Basic Cleaning] was really a skill after all?”\nErin thought about it. It was better than thinking of cavities and rotting gums.\n“…Huzzah. What a great skill! I mean, I might have to fight off giant crabs and Goblins, but at least I’ll be able to clean the floor while they eat me!\nI wouldn’t want to leave a mess.\n”\nShe sighed and dunked her head into the water.\n“Gah!\nCold!”\nThe stream was deep enough that Erin was up to her shoulders in the cold water. And it was moving fast enough that if she lay on her back, she might be swept downstream quite quickly.\n“And if I follow the stream long enough, do I get to an ocean? Or just a lake?”\nIt was a tempting thought. Why not just let the waters carry her away to somewhere else? Anywhere had to be better than here, after all. She could leave and then…\n“Then I’d be eaten by something else. Underwater Goblins, probably.”\nErin punched the water and sighed again.\n“Monsters, monsters all around. And not one of them looks edible. But at least there’s blue fruit that smells like cleaning fluid. And at least there’s a dusty old inn. And at least I have four levels in innkeeping. Huzzah for me.”\nShe splashed some water on her face. Tired. She felt really tired. But being clean was helping a lot. Now that she had water she could drink and eat, at least. And with water, she could even have a bath.\n“A really frickin’ cold bath.”\nBut it was good. And the sun was warm. Erin thought about getting out of the water and lying on the grass while the sun warmed her up. That was a good thought. Her clothes were already drying, and but for the few cuts and burnt right shoulder, they seemed fairly clean.\nBracingly cold bath, food\nand\nwater sources acquired, and a clean inn. The young woman brightened up a bit.\n“Maybe today won’t be so bad after all.”\nErin laughed to herself.\n“Or not. Knock on wood.”\nShe turned jokingly to find a piece of wood to knock on and saw it. A huge shadow in the water. A giant,\nflat\nhead and jagged teeth over a brown, spotted body that had been almost invisible as it slunk along the stream bed. And it was coming straight at—\nErin shot out of the stream like a reverse cannonball just as the fish lunged. She felt something incredibly large brush past her navel, felt the slimy, slick feeling against her skin for one heart-stopping moment—\nThen it was over. Erin lay on the grass, breathing for air as she stared at the fish flopping around on the grass. She recoiled, but the giant shape was flopping now, no longer a missile of death but a confused water breather on the wrong side of the divide between land and sea.\n“W—wh—”\nThe fish flopped towards her. Erin flopped backwards and got to her feet. It might be on land, but it had a mouth as large as her head. It was almost one-third mouth, in fact. And it had very sharp, very long teeth.\nThe flat, squat fish that looked like a balloon with teeth kept thrashing around. It truly was like nothing Erin had ever seen. It was far wider than any regular fish, and only a stingray was that horizontal, but this fish was hardly as elegant. It was more like a brick designed to bite as much of you apart as it could. But for her seeing it, it might have taken a huge chunk out of Erin’s side. Or her face.\nWhether it was trying to still bite Erin or get back in the water was hard to tell. Either way, it wasn’t having much luck; the floppy fish was arcing its body, trying to maneuver in the air as it leapt up and down, but it wasn’t designed to move about on land and mostly stayed where it was, biting at the air helplessly.\nErin stared at it for a good minute. She covered her face and screamed into her hands for a second.\n“Fish. Fish with huge teeth. I hate this world so much.”\nEventually, the fish stopped flopping around. Erin slowly edged over to the fish and stared at it. Was it dead? It didn’t seem to be breathing. It was probably dead.\nShe pointed a trembling finger at the fish.\n“Hah! Take that!”\nThe fish lay there. Erin edged over and nudged it with one toe.\nInstantly, the fish leapt into the air, wriggling like a snake. Its tail smacked Erin in the face as she tried to run. That hurt.\nErin fell over and landed next to the writhing fish. She pulled herself away as the gaping maw opened and closed a few feet from her face and waited until the fish slowly stopped moving again. This time, she was pretty sure it was dead.\n“Four minutes. Four minutes is a long time not to be breathing, right? Okay—”\nJust in case, Erin psyched herself up, ran over, and kicked the fish hard in the side.\n“\nAaaaaah!\n”\nErin hopped around in agony, clutching her foot.\n“Is that thing made of\nrocks?\n”\nIt was like kicking a sack of cement. Not that Erin had ever kicked one, but she imagined that was what it was like. The fish had barely moved when she kicked it. It lay on the ground, jaw gaping open. It was definitely dead, now.\nAfter a while, Erin stopped hopping around and swearing. She limped over to the fish and stared at it. It had…two eyes. Four, actually. But it had two on each side. One big eye and a smaller eye right behind it.\n“Ew. Mutant fish with teeth.”\nErin stared at it for a little while longer. Her stomach rumbled.\n“Right. Lunch.”\nShe poked the fish and tried to think of something to make. She had no fire, no other ingredients aside from blue fruit. The [Innkeeper]’s lips moved soundlessly for a second.\n“…Sushi?”",

    "text": "“Discovery one: fish are heavy.”\nThe dead fish lay on the kitchen counter. It was dripping.\n“Discovery two: kitchens have knives.”\nIt was a very sharp knife, too. It looked sharp, at least. Testing the sharpness with her thumb was probably a good way to lose her thumb. Erin’s arms hurt, and she smelled of fish. Oh, and her clothes weren’t dry. Lastly? She pinched at one nose with a sigh.\n“Discovery three: fish stink.”\nShe sighed. Self-evident discoveries aside, she had no idea what to do next. Or rather, she only had a vague idea of what to do next.\nShe had a fish. You skinned a fish—or was that a bird?—and then you ate it. She was pretty sure about that. A fire was involved at some point, but slicing up the fish was a good first step. After all, wasn’t sashimi just raw fish? True, Erin had only eaten that once, with enough wasabi to burn her nose off, but it was worth a shot.\n“And hey, I need food. So it’s time to chop stuff up.”\nStill, Erin hesitated. She’d never had to cut up a fish before. How was she supposed to do it? She had no idea.\nMaybe this is a moment where my new Skills could come in handy.\nErin had a great idea. She lifted the knife, poked the fish in the side with it, and smiled hopefully.\n“[Basic Cooking]! Give me—baked fish!”\nNothing happened. Erin hadn’t been expecting it, but she’d really, really been hoping the fish would vanish and a convenient, tasty dish would appear. She sighed.\n“Huh. I guess [Basic Cooking] doesn’t work on fish.”\nOr maybe not this fish. Or maybe she needed a fire? Erin gently poked it in the teeth and shuddered. Its scaly hide looked no easier to cut. But at least she had a knife.\nTrue, she could have grabbed a bigger knife. Happily, there were several knives, ranging from one that looked like a proper cleaver to a tiny one the size of a finger. But she’d chosen a slimmer blade, because she didn’t want to wrestle with the big one. Besides, this one was sharpest, and she needed all the sharpness she could get.\nGingerly, Erin began sawing at the fish’s exterior. The knife skated over the scales without finding purchase. Grimly, Erin tried again. She sawed at the side and felt the skin begin to slowly part.\n“Ew. Ew. Ew.”\nAt least she knew the fish bled red. That was really no comfort, actually. Erin warily held the knife as far away from her as possible while carefully pinching the fish with her other hand. She kept slicing at the scales, but she didn’t know how to do this. She didn’t cook as a rule, and fish? She’d buy it pre-filleted and deboned.\nIt was tough, too!\nThe knife did not seem to cut well as she sliced horizontally with it, trying to peel the outside layer off. Erin sawed some more and managed to peel off a slice of skin. She looked into the fish’s insides and gagged.\n“Oh. Oh god. Why—why is that\nyellow?\nWhat\nis\nthat?”\nShe poked it with the knife. The yellow thing vibrated. A bit of pale yellow-white pus oozed from it—\nErin put down the knife and stepped into the common room to breathe for a while. When her stomach had stopped lurching, she went back.\n“There is no\nway\nI’m eating that. Cooked or raw. Actually, there’s no way I’m eating any of this without a frying pan.”\nShe looked around. Frying pan? Check. Good. There was actually a very respectable-looking one made out of cast iron lying right on the counter. She’d seen it on the first day, and while it might need a wash, it was big enough to make an omelet. The fish would need to be in a lot of parts to fry up, though.\n“Okay, okay. Let’s just…get rid of the bones? And the—the squishy stuff.”\nErin cut then hacked at the easily detachable bits. It was hard work. Nothing really wanted to come out, and the knife she’d chosen wasn’t exactly a precision tool.\n“Come on. Get out of there.”\nThe yellow thing was stuck to the bones. She couldn’t get it out.\n“Alright. Can’t go around it. Gotta go under it. Goodbye head, look out belly, here comes the knifey.”\nErin flipped the fish over and tried to cut around the other side. But again, the scales were hard to saw through. And now everything was slippery with blood and fish juice.\n“Come on. Cut. Cut!”\nShe pressed hard with the knife. But it just wasn’t going through the skin. Annoyed, Erin pushed harder. And the knife slipped.\nIt happened in an instant. Her hand lost its traction, and the blade skated across the scales. It flashed left, and Erin recoiled. She yanked her hand back and felt…she saw a flash of red on the blade.\n“…Huh?”\nErin blinked and held up her left hand. A gaping red line split her palm diagonally. There was no blood.\nShe flexed her hand once. That’s when the blood started pooling. But there was no pain. The young woman just stared at it in horror, then gazed about.\nErin looked around. Bandage? There were no bandages nearby. Or cloth.\nHer hand felt…numb. Then tingly.\nBandages? Cloth? There were…curtains upstairs. Right? But they were dirty and moldy too.\nThe blood was dripping onto the fish and the counter. Erin wanted to wipe it away, but she was still holding her knife. And suddenly, her hand started hurting.\n“…Ow.”\nErin dropped the knife.\n“Ahh. Ah.”\nShe gripped her wrist as hard as she could, stopping the blood flow. But the pain kept coming now, on and on.\n“Bandage.”\nShe didn’t remember leaving the kitchen, but she was back with one of the curtains from upstairs and slicing it to make a bandage as blood soaked the cloth. It was hard. She could only use one hand, and her other hand was\nhurting.\nThe pain hadn’t been there at all, but with each microsecond, it was ratcheting up. The terror in her heart was being eclipsed by the need to shout. To scream.\nEventually, she wound the cloth tight and gritted her teeth as she tied a knot. The bloodstain was already spreading, though at least something was covering the wound. But it still hurt.\nIt hurt! Erin tried to think as she stumbled back to the common room. It wasn’t deep. Well, it was deep, but she wasn’t looking at bone. Yet it felt really deep.\n“It hurts.”\nShe didn’t have words to describe the agony in her hand. The rest of the world was dim and unimportant compared to the pain radiating from that one point. All of her senses were focused on that place, and it was all Erin could do not to scream.\n“Screaming is bad. Quiet.”\nShe just knew it. Screaming would make it somehow so much worse. So instead, Erin sat and gripped her wrist. The blood was dripping. It hurt.\nIt really hurt.",

But every few seconds, another drop fell from the bloody bandage onto the floor.\nDrip. Drip.\nThe pain was still there. It didn’t go away, even after this long. But it was—better. At least she could think a bit. She’d moved around, gotten another curtain and sliced it up for a second bandage. But she hadn’t wanted to change the one she was using, so she just sat.\nShe knew she should try to stop the bleeding. Apply pressure. But any more and she would scream. And if she started, she feared she’d never stop.\nThe first hour…the first hour she’d just held her wrist, mouth open, forcing herself\nnot to scream.\nHoping, praying that the agony would desist.

Of course.”\nThe dead fish stared up at her on the cutting board drenched with her blood. It stank. At the same time, Erin’s stomach grumbled. She wasn’t hungry for fish, but she was hungry.\nShe didn’t want to eat, though, if that made sense. Erin walked back to the chair and sat down. As she did, she bumped the back of her legs. The knife cuts burned and hurt. A different kind of pain.\n“I get it. It’s a bad day, right?”\nErin whispered. It made her feel better not to talk loudly. She was awake even though she was tired. The pain wasn’t going to let her sleep. And she was hungry, but she really didn’t want to eat.\nSo she sat and watched her blood fall.\nDrip.",

    "text": "It was dark when the small puddle stopped growing. It soaked into the floorboards, a dark stain in the night. Erin stared at the blackness. She couldn’t sleep.\n“Still hurts.”\nThat was—an understatement. The night was cool, even cold, but sweat was beading on her forehead. Her teeth ached from clenching, and she felt like a single line of pain was her entire being. It radiated up from her hand, and she—\nCouldn’t make a sound. Just think of something else.\nErin stared at the table. She stared at the grain of the wood. Tried to think of—of—things to do? Make bandages? Find…?\nNo good. She couldn’t distract herself. But she had to. Her eyes rolled in her head. Couldn’t she fall unconscious from the pain? If only.\nShe had no strength to stand. It hurt too much. She couldn’t think—the only things that came to her were the most basic instincts. She had to think of something else, though.\nSo Erin began to whisper. She forced herself to—remember. How did it go?\n“Pawn…pawn to E4.”\nShe rested her injured hand on the table. It flared once in pain and then resumed throbbing. Her other hand traced a square, and her eyes darted over the empty table. Her eyes were watery with pain, but she didn’t need to see in the pitch blackness. She knew it by heart.\nHer fingers closed, as if holding something small and delicate. She even moved her left hand, tracing it across the table. Yes. That was how it went. What came next?\n“Pawn to E5. Pawn to F4. Pawn captures F4—King’s Gambit Accepted. Bishop to C4, queen to H4. Check. Bishop’s Gambit. King to F1, pawn to B5. Bryan Counter-gambit. Bishop captures B5, knight moves to F6. Knight moves to F3…”\nThe pained whisper went on and on, until her throat dried and she kept up in her mind. First one game, then another. Erin kept talking to herself, kept playing long into the night. Alone, in the blackness of the inn as the shutters rattled every now and then and faint peeks of moonlight shone through.\nA line of agony trying to divide her in half as she clung to the only thing she knew. Whispering the moves of a famous chess game, an immortal game, into the silence to distract herself.\nBut the pain in her hand never stopped.\nIt just kept hurting.\nAnd hurting.\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "Erin woke up suddenly. Her hand was\nburning.\nThough her head felt like fog, she couldn’t fall back asleep. Instead, Erin just sat and cradled her hand again. She couldn’t move it or the pain would get worse, but sleeping or relaxing were beyond her as well. She could only sit in agony.\nBit by bit, the pain faded away. Maybe it was her waking up, or maybe she just got numb.\n“Either way.”\nErin got up. She still held her hand and took great care not to flex it at all. It was…aching didn’t even begin to describe it. It was just pain, all the way through. And it wasn’t stopping.\nBut at the same time, she\nwas\nravenous. And for a little bit, that overrode her pain.\nSlowly, very slowly, Erin hobbled around the inn. She grabbed the blue fruits with her good hand and began chomping them down one at a time. She was so hungry she ate four before she knew it, and then polished off two more as she sat at a table.\nShe would have sat there forever. Getting up wasn’t worth the effort, but a higher power called to her. It spoke in words she could not ignore.\nBathroom.\nErin sighed and put her head on the table. But the longer she sat the more uncomfortable it became. Still, the pain in her hand fought off the need to go relieve herself for the better part of an hour. When Erin finally stood up, she marched to the inn’s door and kicked it open. She’d go do her business in a random valley and then wash her hands at the stream. Hygiene and all that.\nErin made it five steps out of the inn before she reluctantly turned back and closed the door behind her. She doubted the Goblins would come back, but—safety. That done, she went about the business of doing her business.",

Somehow, the stream seemed to be in a different spot than she’d remembered, and when she’d completed her task, she wasn’t able to retrace her steps.\nThe one benefit of finding the stream was being able to dunk her hand in the cold water to reduce the pain slightly.

    "text": "“Ow. Owch.\nOw\n.”\nEvery time Erin peeled off a bit of the bandage, part of her skin and a lot of blood went with it. Some of it was dried blood. Some of it was not.\nAfter she’d gotten half of the bandage off, Erin had to stop. The pain was too much. And the bandage was stuck to her skin. But having a half-peeled bandage was worse. Erin couldn’t stop picking at it.\n“Maybe I can cut the rest off somehow.”\nErin went to the kitchen. There were certainly sharp things in there. Like knives.\n“Not knives.”\nSo were there scissors? They didn’t seem very medieval, but who knew? Erin decided to go through the cupboards in the kitchen again. She had no energy for the outside, but she couldn’t sleep and she’d only opened about half that first night.\nThis time, no longer panicking, Erin did a systematic search of every drawer and cupboard in the kitchen. The dust that poured out made her sneeze and cough, but she did find some basic cooking utensils like metal spatulas, a drawer full of tarnished silverware, and even some plates. The cupboards held a lot of things that Erin only vaguely understood.\nCooking implements, she suspected, like some weird metal grater with a wood handle. Did you…press down from the top? She found a corkscrew, the tip rusted, a collection of moldy cup holders, and a bunch of other culinary knickknacks. There were a lot of them. And that was…strange. Erin tried to make sense of it out loud since her inner thoughts were mostly devoted to not crying in pain.\n“I’ve seen old kitchens in castles. I thought drawers and that kind of stuff only came later. This is, um, steel. Or at least iron. It\nlooks\nlike steel. Did they have a lot of steel in the medieval ages? Knights in armor, duh. But when were cheese graters invented? Is this place in the Dark Ages or past that? And can I get a light bulb somewhere around here?”\nErin grumbled as she searched with one hand. She threw open another cupboard and stopped. She stared at the pristine interior and the perfectly fresh, perfectly preserved…\n“What the—”\nFood.\nFood was sitting in the cupboard. A gleaming, single link of a sausage, a glass jar filled with white powder, and another container with a knife stuck in the little opening—\nErin had to rub her eyes with her good hand. Then she slapped herself to make sure she wasn’t dreaming. But when she looked again, it was still there.\n“Is that…flour?”\nErin opened the jar and poked a finger at the powder. It felt—real. And fresh. Or, at least, it didn’t feel like white mold and dust, which is what it\nshould\nhave been. Erin drew her finger back, shaking, and stared at the white granules on her finger. She sniffed and nearly sneezed again—no clues from that aside from a lack of much to smell.\n“It\ncould\nbe flour. Or—alternatively, it could be cocaine.”\nShe tried to smile, but her hand hurt too much.\n“…It’s probably flour.”\nBut was it any good? Erin stared at the bag and tried to remember how long things were supposed to stay good. Probably not that long, even in glass jars.\nThey had blown glass in this world?\nNo, focus on the flour. And the sausage? Erin stared at it. It looked like one of those things you saw in old-timey kitchens. Just a…her mouth watered.\nThere was no way that was good.\nNot unless someone had put this here right before she arrived. And if that were the case…no.\nNo, there was something odd about the cupboard. Unlike every other one, there was no dust or spiderwebs, and it had seemed in the best condition of the lot, despite the fraying wood. It smelled like, well, a cupboard, and the food smelled like it was edible.\nIt had to be a trick, though.\nErin sighed and pulled the jar of flour out anyways. Might as well check. But then she caught sight of the pot with the knife in it and opened it. Erin placed it on the counter, removed the lid, and here was\nanother\nsurprise.\nErin’s eyes narrowed, and she frowned hard.\n“That’s butter.”\nThere was no mistaking it. And it wasn’t just butter either. Erin was used to the nice, square sticks of butter that turned soft and spreadable in the sun. This…was more like a\npot\nof butter. Yellow, swirled about, with a knife stuck in it, gleaming and ready to be applied to a bit of bread or something nice. Erin’s stomach rumbled at it, and she was almost tempted to eat it as-is. However—\n“That’s not right.”\nErin stared at the butter. It was a golden yellow,\nfresh\n. Like someone had thawed a stick of butter just now. Same with the sausage and flour—well, the flour was just flour.\nYet everything else? Erin stared around the kitchen. Dust and cobwebs seemed to make up most of the room. She stared at the floor she had yet to sweep.\n“How long does it take for dust to get two inches deep?”\nFive months? Two years? Five years? Either way, Erin was pretty sure butter didn’t last that long. She craned her neck around, suddenly feeling a prickle of suspicion on the back of her neck.\n“Is someone messing with me?”\nErin glanced around. Could someone have put the food in here? But no, her footsteps were the first to disturb the dust. So then how…?\nHer eyes flicked back to the cupboards. At last, something bright caught her attention. It was inlaid around the edges of the cupboard, on the interior door, which was why she hadn’t seen it, but a silver glimmer finally caught her eye.\n“Oh. Oh!”\nErin Solstice stared at a line of glowing, incomprehensible symbols drawn along the edge of the cupboard. They looked like someone had painted them there with the most delicate brush and silver paint. They were nonsensical: circles and connected shapes that almost looked like letters or—\nIt hurt her head just to focus on them, and the longer she stared, the brighter the runes seemed to grow. It was—Erin brushed at the inscriptions and traced them around the edge of the entire pantry. She didn’t know what they meant, but she was convinced this wasn’t just random art or even a fanciful attempt at the real stuff. This meant something, and the hair on the back of her neck rose as she touched one beautiful sigil.\n“Wow. Magic.”\nShe stared at the runes, entranced. Then a thought struck her, and she opened the other cupboards. Could it be that…?\n“Here. Here…they’re everywhere.”\nAround the edges of each cupboard were the same small etchings of runes. Erin traced them with her fingertip, but unlike the cupboard with all the good food, these ones weren’t glowing. The paint was flaking, and beyond the glow, some quality had been lost. She noticed a break in the wood along one solid line of the magic writing and took a wild guess.\n“Huh. I guess it wore off. Or maybe they broke somehow? I wonder what they’re made of.”\nShe went back to the enchanted cupboard in awe. But now curiosity was engulfing her, so she gingerly\ntouched\nthe runes on the cupboard door.\n…It felt like painted wood, but Erin had to believe it was something more. Was it just paint? Could you re-draw this and get more magic? Experimentally, she scraped at the runes with one fingernail. A bit of it flaked off onto her finger.\n“Silver? Or something glowy.”\nIt was fragile, too. The young woman hesitated. Was that supposed to happen? She poked a little harder, not really thinking, just curious.\nThe old wood of the cupboard was beyond delicate with age. Erin’s finger jabbed the lip of the wood, and a splinter of it came away. Just a thin fragment of wood. And silver, glowing magic.\nThe fragment of wood disrupted the glowing line traced around the cupboard. The glowing symbols flickered—and as Erin watched in horror, they faded away.\n“No,\nnonono—\n”\nThe sliver of wood dropped to the ground, and Erin stared at the piece then tried to replace it.\n“Don’t do this to me! No—I just—”\nShe tried to press it back into place, and the wood\ncracked,\nand more runes flaked away and drifted downwards in a little spiral of silver dust and wood. Erin stood there, mouth open in horror.\n“Oh you’ve got to be shi—”\nErin pulled back too far as she stood up, overbalanced, and fell backwards. She didn’t hit the ground too hard, but her bad hand smacked the ground. Instantly, Erin grabbed her hand and cradled it, but she could feel the blood running again. She curled up into a ball and stayed there for a long time.\n“It’s not fair. It’s not fair.”\nErin looked up after the pain faded a bit. She saw a dark cupboard. When she got up, the food was still the same, but the magic had gone.\nDully, she stared at the now dark symbols. Dead. Just like that. The food? Still fresh. But it wouldn’t be fresh any longer. And the magical cupboard was dead. Forever.\nErin rubbed at her eyes. She wasn’t crying. But her eyes stung a bit. That was all.\nThat was all.",

Can’t carry everything. But you had good food still here. And more, in those other cupboards. And here’s a kitchen full of supplies…how expensive are good, sharp knives?”\nErin flexed her hand and winced again. Very sharp knives.\n“No one leaves that behind. So why would anyone…?”\nIt was a bad thought to have. Erin suddenly felt very uneasy. The hair on her neck began prickling, and her stomach began doing pushups.\n“Question. How did Mr. Skeleton upstairs die?”\nHer spine tingled.\n“Maybe that’s a bad question.”\nBut once asked, it wasn’t easy to get rid of. Erin tried to ignore it. She stared at the dried blood on her hand, ate another blue fruit, but the thought lingered. Eventually, she couldn’t bear it any longer. She stood up.\n“Upstairs. Fine. Hello darkness my old enemy.”\nIt wasn’t nearly as hard going up the stairs. Now that she knew what was in every room, going down the dark hallways wasn’t scary. But going in the last room? That was very scary.\nErin took a few deep breaths before she opened the door. Her palm was sweaty on the doorknob.\n“Am I afraid of dead people? Well yeah. But they can’t hurt me. Zombies can, but normal dead people can’t. It’s just a skeleton. I can take a look for signs of—of death, and then I’ll go sleep. Good plan. Let’s do it.”\nShe opened the door and stared inside. Then she ran back and started opening the other doors on the top floor, slamming into each room before running to the next. But what she sought was not there.\nSlowly, Erin walked back to the room at the far end and looked inside. A sagging bed, a small table, a shuttered window. Nothing else. Erin whispered into the silence.\n“It’s gone.”",

It wasn’t that she was waiting for a pile of bones to fall from the ceiling. But…she would prefer to know where said bones had gone.\n“Okay. Okay. What’s the problem? It was just a skeleton. Just a spooky, dead thing. And even if it did move—somehow, where would it go?”\nShe didn’t know why she was whispering to herself. It just made her feel…well, it didn’t make her feel\nbetter\n, but it felt appropriate. It was getting dark. It was nearly night. In the circumstances, being loud didn’t feel like the smart thing to do.\nAnd the skeleton might hear her.\n“No, no. That’s impossible. It’s not here. It’s somewhere else. Besides, where could it hide? I checked all the rooms upstairs. So where could it be?”\nThe…cupboards?\nHer eyes darted towards the kitchen. No. It couldn’t be. She’d checked.\nWhat about underneath the floorboards? Or on the roof?\nErin kept very still and listened. Nothing. That was good, right?\nBut skeletons don’t need to breathe\n.\nThey don’t need to move until you’re asleep. And then…\nEnough. Erin shook her head. It was all in her head. There had to be a perfectly good reason for a corpse to disappear suddenly—\nWhat about the walls?\nErin refused to turn her head. She was just being paranoid. Which was a good thing. Because it could be anywhere. She could just see herself, asleep, as a skeleton tip-toed out of the darkness, a knife in hand and—\nShe wrenched herself out of that idea. Skeletons didn’t do that, she had to believe. It was more reasonable to assume someone had taken it. The skeleton was not her imagination. Someone had taken it. Why?\n“Because it was valuable? Because skeletons are\nso\nuseful, sure. Maybe the Goblins did it. Can’t you eat bones? Or—someone else?”\nThat was just as inconceivable. Okay, maybe someone, something took the skeleton. But why? And when?\nErin’s mind suddenly flashed back to when she’d returned that morning. Hadn’t the inn’s door been open? She hadn’t noticed at the time, but she remembered closing it as she left. She didn’t remember having to open it when she got back.\nHer skin crawled. The inn suddenly felt a lot less safe.\nBut it was just her imagination. She had an overactive imagination. If she went to sleep, all would be well. All she had to do was close her eyes, and when she woke up, all would be well. There was nothing to worry about. Erin couldn’t even hear anything except the rapid beating of her heart and the\ncreaking.\nCreaking. A footstep.\nErin sat bolt upright. Her heart felt like it was about to stop from sheer overwork. Her eyes darted to the ceiling.\nSomething was up there.\nShe heard it moving about. Maybe if she’d been more relaxed she might never have noticed the faint creaks and groans of floorboards as something crept around upstairs. And judging by the sounds…\nErin tracked the progress of the creature above her. It was moving to the stairwell.\nSlowly, Erin clenched her bad hand to avoid screaming. The pain as her sliced hand throbbed and started to bleed grounded her. Silently, she stood up.\nThe knife was on the table. Erin held it in her good hand and moved around. The stairwell was on the right side of the room. Anyone coming down wouldn’t be able to see her if she were in the rightmost corner.\nSkirting the chairs and tables, Erin made her way over and crouched down. The handle of the kitchen knife was slippery in her hand with sweat. Her other hand was slippery with her blood. She gazed at the blade of the knife. It was very sharp.\nThe creaking stopped for a moment as the intruder reached the top of the stairs. Erin waited. It would come down. And when it did, she’d get one chance to attack first.\nAttack first? Am I some kind of hero?\nNo. New plan. The instant Erin saw what it was, she was running for her life. But she had to see what it was first.\nThe skeleton popped into her head. Was it that? Or was it the creature that had stolen its bones? Was it some kind of parasitic creature that lived in dead corpses—or a gaunt nightprowler that ate the marrow of the deceased?\nPlease let it just be a skeleton.\nThe monster started descending the stairs. Quietly. Slowly. Even though Erin was listening, she barely heard the sound it made. She tried to guess how far down it was. Halfway. Two-thirds. A few steps left.\nSomething left the last step and walked into the common room. Erin didn’t breathe. She didn’t move, or even blink.\nSlowly, the creature stepped closer. Erin squinted and gasped as it came into view. Then she stood up and sighed.\n“Oh. Just a Goblin.”\nThe short green creature whirled around in surprise as Erin stood up with a sigh. It immediately crouched, its sharp dagger held in a fighting stance. It snarled at her.\nShe snarled back.",

It was hurting—\n“Feels like it’s worse than yesterday. Which is probably my imagination.”\nShe sat, cradling her hand for a full minute. Then she remembered why she was sitting there and shot to her feet.\n“Skeleton? Goblins.”\nWhere was it? Erin hobbled over to a table. There. Two daggers on the tabletop. She looked around at the windows—some even had furniture piled up to make sure nothing could get in. And she’d been up all night, waiting to hear anything trying to come in. But no other Goblins had, and the other one had left its dagger as well, albeit unwillingly. Erin mumbled to herself as she poked one of the hilts with a finger.\n“At this rate, I’m going to start a collection.”\nAt least it proved she hadn’t been dreaming. Well, until she’d fallen asleep. But nothing had killed her, so Erin tried to put the disappearing corpse out of her mind.\n“No skeleton? No problem. I hope.”\nShe sighed and then sniffed.\n“What’s that smell?”\nSomething smelled\nreally\nbad. And it was coming from the kitchen. The instant Erin opened the door, she groaned aloud.\nThe fish lay on the cutting board, covered in dry blood and reeking in the sunlight. It stank. Actually, it smelled worse than that.\n“This. This is disgusting.”\nErin stared at the fish for a few more seconds. She had absolutely\nno\ndesire to touch it. On the other hand…\nA few black things crawled out of the fish’s mouth.

    "text": "It took her a long time before she found the courage to return. And even then, it was just to run in, grab the cutting board, and leg it to the stream.\n“Ew, ew,\new.\n”\nErin thrust the plank of wood in the water and watched fish guts and insects sweep away into the current. It wasn’t the dead fish she objected to. Well, not as much as the live bugs that clung stubbornly to the wood. They were small, and she wasn’t sure if she was relieved or further disgusted to see they were flies, not beetles or anything worse.\nBig flies, though, with fat, glowing abdomens. Like—disgusting fireflies, lurid green instead of nice yellow. Not that fireflies were that cute up close either. Erin pointed at the last straggler refusing to be pulled off by the water.\n“You. Get off.”\nThe tenacious fly seemed to have the strength of ten bugs, because it refused to let the current drag it off. Erin lifted the board a bit and realized this fly had other odd qualities. Something about its head was triangular, and yes, that glowing abdomen was far bigger than a firefly’s. It even looked slightly…liquid, and the bloated insect was like nothing she had ever seen before on Earth.\n“Another weird creature. Wonderful.”\nReluctantly, she looked closer.\nKnow thy enemy, right?\nShe supposed she should also know her bug.\n“That’s definitely a bug. And it’s really ugly. If I could take it to a scientist back home, I bet I’d be famous. Since I can’t—go away, would you?”\nShe dunked the board and shook it underwater.\nSwish. Swish\n. The bug clung to the wet wood despite Erin’s best attempts to shake it off. Then she noticed another detail.\n“…Why’s it got four legs? I thought bugs had six.”\nIt was also segmented in two places, as if the bug had people-legs. That was weird and disconcerting. And still, it refused to let go of the wood, fanning its wings futilely and trying to fly off. Probably to join its many siblings still buzzing around the dead fish’s corpse. Well, Erin wasn’t going to bother the rest of them, but this one? This one had a date with the water. It just refused to go.\nAnnoyed at this resistance, Erin finally pulled the cutting board out of the water. The insect fanned its wings as she stared at it. It was really mostly like a firefly, except that its backside was glowing green. Better than a cockroach, but there was only one way to deal with bugs like that.\nErin curled her finger and gave the bug a damn good flick.\nIt exploded.\nThe insect’s green abdomen burst into a splatter of green liquid as the rest of it flew off into the stream. Erin blinked as the green liquid covered the cutting board and splashed into the water.\nSome of it landed on Erin’s arm. Instantly, both the board and her arm began to\nsmoke\nand dissolve.\n“\nAhh! Owowowowowow!\n”\nShe plunged her arm into the water. It was an instinctive reaction, but it made the pain vanish. Still, Erin frantically scrubbed at the spot until all of the burning pain had gone. She looked at the cutting board and stared as the green liquid ate into the wood until she dunked it into the water. Then she stared at her burnt skin, and the cutting board, eaten away by…\nErin turned her head and backed away as the rest of the glowing insects buzzed around the dead fish.\n“Acid flies. Okay, that’s completely wrong.”",

The fish’s body was swarming with those little acid flies. They were probably laying eggs in it or something equally fun.\nBriefly, Erin considered dragging the fish into the stream and letting all the buggers drown. Then she considered what would happen if all the flies landed on her and exploded.\n“Right. Well, there’s only one thing to do in a situation like this.”\nErin raised first one, then both her middle fingers.

    "text": "“I really should have brought a bucket.”\nErin stared at the ingredients lined up on the kitchen counter. Her stomach was rumbling, and she was in the mood for food. But she didn’t really want another breakfast, lunch, and dinner of blue fruit. Today, she was in the mood for bread. Freshly baked bread. And that lovely bit of sausage.\nShe’d been holding off on eating either, mainly due to the pain and infestation of her kitchen, but Erin was relieved to find the bugs hadn’t gone for the good food, instead preferring the fresh, rotting corpse of the fish. So she had ingredients! Enough to make bread!\nUnfortunately, that required water. And Erin really didn’t want to walk to the stream and back with a heavy bucket. But she needed water. She knew that. Somehow.\nWas it instinct? Erin frowned and knocked on her skull. She had never made food, not really. Well, she’d made Mac and Cheese and instant ramen, but that didn’t count. And that went for microwaves and ovens too. So why did she know that to make bread she needed flour, oil, salt, sugar, yeast, and some water? It had to be magic.\nOr a skill.\n“[Basic Cooking], huh?”\nErin stared at the washed cutting board. Yes, all the ingredients were here. It made sense; this was a kitchen. Kitchens had ingredients. Therefore, she could make bread. Or dough. To make bread, she’d have to bake it in an oven. Handily, this kitchen had an old oven that Erin’s instincts told her she could use. But to use the oven, she needed fire.\nShe had no idea how to make a fire.\nWhatever new ability she had to make food, it did not extend to making fire. Erin stared at the empty fireplace in the oven and thought.\n“Sticks. You hit sticks together. Or rocks.”\nShe looked around. She had wood. There were lots of chairs and tables. What she didn’t have were matches. Or a lighter. Or a can full of gasoline and a flamethrower.\nErin went back to the kitchen. There\nhad\nto be something to start fires in there. How else would you cook things?\n“Right. Rummage time. I know I saw a shelf full of weird stuff somewhere…”\nShe went back through the shelves. In her first search through the kitchen, she’d put everything vaguely useful or non-rusted in the cupboard next to the food.\n“Let’s see. Frying pan? No. Tongs? No. A saw? Why does a kitchen need a saw?”\nErin set the small handsaw aside and squinted. Behind that was something she hadn’t quite figured out. Well, two things—a rock and something else. Something weird.\n“Is that…a horseshoe?”\nNo. It was way too small to be a horseshoe and the wrong shape. Unless this world had really weird, small horses that was. But even then, why have horseshoes in a kitchen?\n“Unless they ate horses.”\nErin stared at the horseshoe-thing. She stared at the rock. Slowly, she slid the rock along the fire striker and watched sparks fly.\n“Huh. So\nthat’s\nwhat flint and steel looks like. It actually does look like Minecraft!”\nErin paused. She sighed and slapped herself gently.\n“I’m an idiot.”",

And the tinder caught fire in places, and the fire grew.\nErin held her breath. Then she exhaled, blowing at the small flames like she’d seen television campers do.\n“Damn. It went out.”\nShe struck the flint and steel again. This time, she let the fires grow a bit and did not blow on them. Slowly, the small fires grew. She fed the small flames pieces of wood and grinned.\n“Fire! Call me Prometheus…Prome\nthea\n.”\nThe warmth on her front became a little too hot, so Erin scooted back, but she was grinning. Well, she was grinning until she sat on her bad hand.\n“Okay. Pain. But now I can make bread! I’ve got all the ingredients. Right? Right.

    "text": "In the end, Erin let the fire burn while she went to get water. The fireplace was stone, and the kitchen was stone. The odds of a stray spark walking all the way to the common room was remote. Still, she felt uneasy.\n“This is how it starts, right? You leave the fireplace on while you go on a vacation for a few days, and the next thing you know, your inn’s burned down. A classic cautionary tale.”\nErin sighed as she walked along. She wondered again how much trouble she was really in. After all, she had just started a fire, true, but that was pretty basic even for primeval Humans. What could—\nA patch of green moved in the grass ahead of her. Erin stared at it. Was it part of the grass? It raised its head and stared back. It wasn’t the grass at all. It was—\nSomething\nexploded out of the grass. Erin screamed, flailed wildly with her bucket, and fell over. The gigantic bird with leathery wings and a beak longer than her arm took off into the sky with an ear-piercing\nscreech.\nShe caught a flash of\nscales,\nas green as the grass it had blended in with, and the long head and beaked teeth? The young woman gaped upwards.\n“Oh. Oh wow.”\nErin sat on the ground and stared.\n“Is that a…pterodactyl? No way.”\nIt looked like it. And while Erin was only really seeing its rapidly disappearing backside, the bird had a certain…non-feathery quality to it. However, where the ancient dinosaurs Erin had seen in museum pictures were brown and plain, this bird had been a light green with red markings along its head and beak and the tips of its wings.\n“Camouflaged dinosaur birds. Now I’ve really seen everything.”\nErin shook her head and got back up. She brushed off her dirty t-shirt and jeans.\n“Gotta wash these sometime. But that means I’ll be walking around naked. Is that an issue? And what’s that smell?”\nSomething smelled truly terrible. Erin covered her nose and frowned. She cast around for the source of the smell. It was on the ground somewhere. She walked ten steps and found a nest. Erin stared down at a neat ring of dirt, trampled grass, and stones. A nest on the\nground?\nBut then—she didn’t see many trees nearby, and the only other place would be those cliffs.\n“Huh. I guess without many trees birds get lazy. But what a big nest. And what’s that inside—”\nErin took one look inside the nest and covered her mouth. She gagged and took a few deep breaths.\n“Okay. At least I know where all the normal birds go. Inside the dinosaur-birds.”\nAverting her eyes from the grisly remains, Erin turned to go. She took two steps and tripped.\n“Ow.”\nShe got up, cradled her injured hand a bit, and wished for the world to explode. Or just her. Then she squatted down to look at what she’d tripped over. She saw a\nsecond\nnest, this one much cleaner and smaller. And it was filled with big, round, pale…\n“Eggs?”",

    "text": "Buckets could hold things. Ideally they held water, but they could also hold eggs. They could also hold eggs\nin\nwater.\nIt was still a pain to haul the bucket across the grasslands, though. Erin puffed and huffed and kept up a running stream of complaints as she lugged the full water bucket along.\n“People used to do this every day? This is why plumbing was invented, you know. Who puts a stream so far from an inn? What happened to a good well?”\nShe kept grumbling until she reached the inn. Once there, Erin had to lean against the door and pant like a dog for a while before she felt better. She noticed a sign hanging next to her nose and squinted at the faded lettering.\n“Huh. ‘Closed?’ Is that English?”\nIt was English. Slightly stylistic, each letter carefully traced in black paint, but Erin understood it nonetheless.\n“Huh. So people speak English here. Good to know!”\nThen she frowned at another word painted right below it. Not English. The lettering was far more curvy, and based on her limited knowledge of Earth’s languages—it looked completely unique.\n“Hold on. What’s this word?”\nIt looked…odd. This was clearly an open-closed sign. Erin could tell because it was on the front door, and because she flipped it over and, just as expected, it said ‘Open’ on the back.\nAnd there was a second word right below it, in that other language.\nErin had no idea what it meant; it was foreign to her. But if she had to guess?\nIt probably said ‘Open’ too. In a different language. Just like signs back home. And that meant—Erin felt a shiver run down her spine.\nThat meant there were two languages here.\nTwo sets of writing, at any rate. Furthermore, it confirmed Erin’s suspicions.\n“This was an inn once. But someone abandoned it. And they left a lotta useful stuff behind.”\nShe tapped her lips thoughtfully and narrowed her eyes at the hanging sign. The rope was frayed and worn, but it was still in pretty good shape.\n“…Well, finders keepers.”\nErin kicked open the door to the inn and dragged the bucket inside. But she paused and stepped out to look at the sign.\nIt was a sudden whim. Erin flipped the sign over so it read ‘Open’.\n“Now, where can I get a piece of chalk and write ‘no Goblins allowed’?”\nWell, that was a question for later. Right now, Erin was more concerned about the precious water. She had the water. She had dragged the water very painfully all the way here. Now she had to find a place to store said water. The bucket was nice, but it was also sort of small and definitely not useful as a long-term container. It was leaking a bit. So where else could she put it?\nErin wandered into the kitchen.\n“Well, here’s a cauldron.”\nIt was actually a pot, but it looked like a cauldron. It was in fact both things at once. The point was that it could store water. Unfortunately, that meant the cauldron had to be cleaned first.\nErin tried to use as little water as possible. But the pot was large, filled with dust, and the bucket was finite. She eventually ran out of water and had to make another trip back. And then another.\nWhen the cauldron was finally full of water and clean enough to hold said water, Erin was ready to kill something. Like eggs. She stared longingly at the fresh sausage, but she shook her head.\n“\nNo.\nNo. You deserve at least a sandwich. Or eggs and sausage.\n”\nThat would make it taste\nso\nmuch better. So Erin decided to commit. She tromped back into the kitchen and stared at the grey embers in the fireplace. The fire was long dead. Erin groaned and then scowled. She pointed at the embers accusatorially.\n“I’ll deal with you later. For now, I need dough.”\nDough was easy. It was just mixing stuff, and Erin had plenty of stuff to mix. But an idea struck her as she stared at her ingredients.\nBread took a while to bake. Bread needed to rise and do all kinds of complicated yeasty-stuff according to her [Basic Cooking] skill. And to be fair, that was about all she could make with the ingredients at hand. Not much you could do with a bit of flour, right? But eggs? Eggs changed\neverything\n.\nErin stared at the flour. She stared at the butter and salt. Then she stared at the eggs. Her eyes narrowed.\n“Forget bread. It’s pasta time.”",

    "text": "The mixing bowl was full of flour, a dash of salt, some water, and butter. Oil would be best, but Erin didn’t have oil, so butter would do. She grinned. This was easy. Then she cracked the egg.\nA large, glistening yolk fell into the bowl. The eggs of the giant dino-birds were about three times bigger than normal bird eggs. That could make a lot of pasta. But there was just one thing different about these eggs.\n“Oh. Oh god. Why are there red lines—?”\nErin covered her mouth.\n“It was alive. There was a baby inside.”\nHer stomach lurched. But there was nothing to throw up. Erin took a few deep breaths and tried to think.\n“Right. Normal eggs actually hatch. Right. This isn’t a store, so of course they’d be living—but they must be new eggs. Not full of half-born chickens, right?”\nShe stared at the rest of the eggs.\nRight?",

If that was the word for it.\n“Sorry, baby dino-birdlings. But I really need to eat. And you look nice and doughy right now.”\nShe punched the dough ball gently. The kneading was done. It was time to roll it and slice it into nice, pasta-sized shapes.\nTo her credit, Erin barely hesitated when she grabbed the sharp knife again. But she did take the time to wash the blood off before she began slicing. And though it took her a bit longer to cut everything since she worked with one hand and tried to keep all her digits out of the knife’s path, she eventually had a pile of long stringy noodles ready to be boiled.\nErin held the first batch of raw noodles over the boiling water in the pot.\n“Double double, boil and trouble…into the pot you go.”\nThe noodles fell in with a large splash. Erin yelped and jumped away.\n“Hot!”\nWhen she was finished calling herself an idiot, Erin sat back and waited. The noodles wouldn’t take that long. Then she could add some more butter, a little more salt, and feast. It was a good plan.\n“Too bad I don’t have something refreshing to drink as well. A nice glass of juice would go down great. But y’know, it’s not like I…can…”\nErin stood up. She walked back into the common room and looked around.\nThe pile of blue fruits was right where she had left them. Erin’s eyes narrowed as she looked at them. She stroked her chin in thought.\n“Blue juice?”\nShe shook her head.\n“Nah. Blue fruit juice? That’s more like it.”",

    "text": "It was a messy process, peeling each blue fruit and then pulping the fruit into a mush. And then of course there was the mandatory trip to the stream with the bucket in order to get enough water to add to the mixture, not to mention to clean the glasses, plates, and silverware. By the time she’d made her umpteenth trip to fetch water, Erin’s arms felt like they were about to fall off. But that was okay, because she now had a drink.\n“Mm! Sweet! This stuff’s like syrup! Chunky syrup! Or…a smoothie.”\nErin put the pitcher of blue fruit juice in the common room and checked on the noodles. She didn’t know how long to cook them, but she’d been taking out a strand or two every few minutes to make sure it was good. At last, she decided it was ready.\n“Hm. Chewy. Tasty! Pasta is the greatest food in the entire world.”\nThe last thing she did was take the red sausage out of the cupboard and slice it up. She did it very finely, keeping her fingers far from the blade, but she diced the entire thing.\nIt had little pepper flakes inside.\nAnd the meat looked good. Erin couldn’t help but take one sliver; she resisted the urge to gobble it down and put the rest in the noodles. She might not get more for a long time.\nThe sausage tasted like sausage.\nHot, spicy, and so flavorful it burst in her mouth. Erin’s eyes went slightly misty. It wasn’t blue fruits or—it tasted like\nfood.\nShe couldn’t cry, though. She was far too hungry. Erin rubbed her eyes briskly and created a huge serving of noodles and dumped it onto a plate.\n“Hm. Fork…fork! Am I missing anything?”\nShe felt like there was something missing. But—she brought the food into the common room anyways and sat down.\n“Who knew carrying stuff with one hand was so much of a pain? I mean, everything’s a pain.”\nThe pasta was nice and hot. Erin felt her stomach rumbling. But something still felt off. And pain was still present.\n“But it’s a better day, right? A bit of a better day.”\nErin stared at the plate. Pasta, check. Fork, check. Juice, check.\nShe sighed. A smile tried to climb onto her face. Her hand throbbed, but Erin kept the smile up and raised her fork. She was going to eat until she puked. Okay, maybe until she was just full. She raised the first glistening noodle to her lips.\nKnock, knock\n.\nWithout thinking, Erin stood up and went to the door. She opened it as if she were at her home.\n“Hi, can I help you?”\nA giant insect stood in the doorway. It raised one chitin hand in greetings and opened its mandibles as its antennae waved in Erin’s face.\n“Greetings. May we come in?”\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "A giant insect stood in the doorway. It had large, black, bulbous eyes like a bug, no pupils, just tiny facets reflecting the light, a dark brown chitinous body, almost black, and a pair of swords at its sides. A giant shell like a beetle or turtle’s covered its back, and the entire effect made the bug-man look slightly hunched.\nIt had four arms, each one covered in chitin but shaped almost like a Human’s, complete with fingers, and two long mandibles coming out of its mouth, shaped like pincers. A pair of waving antennae were attached to the thing’s head. No hair, no nose, no…clothing, really. Just a loincloth and a belt and a pair of\nswords\nsheathed at its side?\nThere was something shiny and metal pinned to its chest, but she was mostly just staring at the\nant-person in front of her.\nErin stared at the ant-creature, lost for words. Then it opened its mouth and began to speak again.\n“Good evening, Miss Human. I was wondering if my colleague and I could take up a moment of your time—”\nErin shut the door. Then she bolted it. Where did she put the kitchen knife?\n“You idiot. I\ntold\nyou this is why I should have opened the door.”\nA second, louder, muffled voice came through the door.\nA second bug-person?\nThis one had a slight rasp to it, sibilant. Erin heard the two talking as she looked around.\nWeapon. She needed—\nThe Goblins’ knives were on the table. She grabbed both and tried to think. Knife. Chair? There were lots of chairs.\n“Maybe it was a bad time?”\nOr windows. Erin looked around. Plenty of windows. She’d jump out one if she needed to.\n“Move over. Let me show you how it’s done.”\nSomeone knocked on the door again. Erin froze, and then went back. Very slowly, she opened the door.\nA giant lizard—no, a miniature Dragon that looked sort of like a Human stared down at Erin. He had to be at least six-and-a-half feet tall.\nHe was huge, muscular, with scars parting the rippling scales instead of flesh. His head was shaped like a lizard’s—or a Dragon’s. No nose, again, but a snout and slitted pupils, not round. His scales were light green, and he had sharp,\nsharp\nclaws on each hand. Yet he also had a very humanoid body—except for his feet, which were taloned like a dinosaur or lizard’s. Or a Dragon’s, again. He even had a long tail, which dragged on the ground behind him, and neck-spines sticking out the back of his head!\nWhen he smiled, she saw his teeth. Pointed and sharp. Oh, and he had a forked tongue. The Dragon-man raised one claw and opened his mouth wider in a grin.\n“Hello, Miss. Sorry if we—”\nErin shut the door, bolted it, and dragged a table in front of it. She could feel her heart pounding out of her chest as she pushed another table in the way. Knives were no good. He was\nhuge!\nShe’d have to jump out a window after all. She heard the first person, the bug-guy—he sounded like a guy—speaking drily.\n“Good job not scaring her.”\n“Shut up. This is your fault. I told you I should go first. I’m not a horrific Ant.”\n“Yes, but I have my badge on. You have not brought yours. Again. For the eighth day in a row. Therefore, I was the most logical choice to—”\nWere they\ntalking?\nErin listened hard. Her hands were shaking so hard she couldn’t hold anything. She heard them trying the door and finding it locked.\n“Now what? I do not believe breaking and entering would be appropriate at this moment.”\n“What, are you crazy? Let me talk. That was just a misunderstanding caused by seeing your face. I’ll straighten all this out.”\nOne voice was higher than the other and had a strange\nclicking\nquality about it. Erin guessed that was the insect’s. The other, the lizardman, pronounced his words with elongated s’s. And they were both speaking in English.\n“Hello? Miss? We’re not dangerous.”\nOne of them was knocking on the door. Erin tried not to hyperventilate. Her eyes darted to the window. But she had to ask.\n“…Are you a Dragon?”\nShe heard a surprised laugh from outside the door.\n“Am I a Dragon? Aha. Haha. Well, that’s just—oh, Ancestors bite me. I mean, do I look like one? I’m not even Oldblood, but maybe I do. Klb, buddy, what do you think?”\n“You are blushing.”\n“Be quiet. I’m in a good mood now.”\nThe lizardman raised his voice again.\n“Excuse me? I’m not a Dragon, Miss Human. I’m just an incredible Drake in service to the City Watch. Me and my idiot partner were on patrol when we noticed the smoke. May we come in? I promise we won’t bite.”\n“Or inflict other forms of bodily or mental harm upon you.”\n“\nShut up.\nAre you trying to scare her?”\nErin debated. Somewhere in her mind, she was trying to decide whether she should be laughing or panicking. And if she were going to laugh, would it be funny laughter or hysterics?\nShe couldn’t decide. So instead—\n“Um. Give me a moment. I’ll open this door.”\n“Thank you very much.”\nErin dragged the tables out of the way and hesitantly unlatched the door. She opened it and stared at the insect and giant lizard again. The insect just stared at her. The lizard, on the other hand, opened his mouth and curved his lips upward. It might have been a smile.\n“…Hi.”\nErin’s hand tensed on the door. The lizard guy put his hand on the door and stopped her from closing it. She tried, but suddenly the door was locked into place. He gently opened it and gave her a lazy salute with his other clawed hand.\n“Sorry, sorry, Miss. We’re not here to hurt you, I promise.”\nErin hoped that was the case. She couldn’t budge the door an inch. But this wasn’t the time for flight, right? She took a different tack.\n“W-want something to eat?”\nThe lizardman blinked.\n“Um, sure.”\n“Okay. That’s great.”\nErin opened the door slowly. The lizardman smiled and carefully stepped inside. The giant insect walked in too and gave her a polite nod.\n“Good evening.”\n“…Hi.”\nThe two stared around the empty inn. Erin pointed to the table while keeping her eye on them the entire time.\n“Food’s over there.”\n“Ooh! Pasta! This is good stuff!”\nThe lizardman—Drake—rubbed his hands together. The noise the scales made sounded like sandpaper. He went to sit at the table, but the insect guy paused.\n“I would gladly partake of nourishment if offered. However, we would not wish to deprive you of your meal.”\n“What? No. I’ve got lots of pasta.”\nErin pointed vaguely back to the kitchen.\n“Let me just get a plate and…forks. Do you, uh, want a drink? I’ve got water.”\nThe two strangers exchanged a glance. The Drake raised one claw.\n“I’ll have a glass if that’s alright.”\nThe ant man instantly copied him with a nod.\n“I will accept the pasta and water as well. But may I inquire if you have any more meat-based dishes? Corusdeer, perhaps?”\nWhat was a…?\nErin shook her head.\n“…No. No I do not.”\n“A pity.”\nErin went to get the plates. She heard the two sitting and chatting idly while she went to the kitchen. There she took a moment to sit on the ground and slap herself a few times. Then she got the plates. An idea occurred to her as she was filling the cups with water, and she poked her head out.\n“Here. Uh, I’ve got juice as well. Want a glass?”\nThe Drake blinked as she offered him a cup. He stared at the liquid inside and eyed his companion.\n“Oh, thank you. It’s…blue.”\n“Yeah. I made it myself. It tastes good, really.”\nA moment’s hesitation and the giant lizard-man accepted it with a shrug.\n“Well, I’ll gladly accept. Klbkch, you want any?”\nHe turned to his companion, and the other figure declined.\n“I will pass for the moment. We should get down to business rather than partake of food.”\n“In a moment. Let’s eat first. This looks good!”\nErin stared. Here was an opportunity. She had two creatures who could not only speak English for some reason, but were also not inclined to kill her and were eating her food. There were so many questions she could ask about herself, about where she was, about everything really.\nIt might be her questions would decide her ultimate fate. Probably not, but they were certainly important. But before Erin could ask any of the questions, including how a ‘Drake’ and giant ant learned to use a knife and fork, she had to ask again.\n“…Are you\nsure\nyou’re not a Dragon?”",

    "text": "“…So someone on the walls spotted the smoke and called it in. Since it didn’t seem like a grassfire and since we knew this place was abandoned years ago, the Captain decided to send someone to check it out.”\n“To put it succinctly: we saw the fire and decided to investigate.”\nThe giant lizard turned and glared at his ant man companion.\n“That’s what I said.”\nThe ant fellow replied stoically; his voice never seemed to change, unlike the boisterous lizard guy. He was—precise.\n“You said it poorly. I am merely rephrasing your words for the benefit of all.”\n“See,\nthis\n. This is why no one else is willing to be your partner. Along with you being, y’know,\nyou.\n”\n“Your hurtful remarks are unnecessary. Besides which, I believe we are getting off track. We are in the presence of a member of the general public, remember.”\n“Oh. Right. Sorry.”\nThe lizardman cleared his throat. It sounded weird to Erin; much deeper and bassier than normal. She was transfixed, as much by the surreality of having them eating with her as the fact that the ant man had excellent table manners and his companion did not—and the way they just—talked, bantered, even. It was beyond weird.\nActually,\neverything\nwas weird to Erin at the moment. Not least were the two creatures sitting across from her.\nWell, maybe ‘creatures’ was unfair. They were probably people. They acted like people. But they looked—\nErin stared at the lizardman’s arms. They were huge. She’d seen bodybuilders on magazine covers and terrible gym commercials, but this guy was bigger than 90% of the male population. The Human male population. And he was green. And he had scales.\nHe glanced her way. His eyes were like a snake’s. Or a lizard’s. She looked away hastily and glanced at the ant man. At least, she thought he was an ant.\nWhile he wasn’t that much smaller than the average guy, the insect guy looked tiny next to his partner. But of the two, he was definitely higher on the weirdness scale. Mainly because he was a giant insect. He had\nantennae\n.\n“Miss?”\nErin jumped.\n“Me? Hi, yes, me.”\nThe lizardman gulped down some of the blue juice.\n“Sorry, but can we ask you a few questions about where you’re from? It’s pretty odd to find a Human out here, let alone in an abandoned place like this. Not that we mean to pry, it’s just that it’s kind of our job to ask these questions.”\n“What? Oh, it’s no problem. Ask away.”\nThe insect guy leaned forwards.\n“Well, to begin with, may we inquire where you come from?”\n“I’m from Michigan.”\nThe two exchanged a glance while Erin mentally slapped herself.\n“Michigan? I’m not familiar with that city. Or is it a nation…? Is that north of here? Over the mountains, maybe? On this continent?”\n“Uh. No. It’s a bit further than that.”\n“Oh, so are you…lost? Or travelling maybe?”\nErin shook her head.\n“No, actually I got lost and—this is stupid. Why am I making excuses?”\nAgain, the glances were exchanged. The Drake coughed into one claw. The ant man began making notes on a pad.\n“Um, I don’t know?”\nErin sighed and spread her hands on the table.\n“Look. It’s complicated, and I can’t really explain. But would you believe…magic? Like a crazy, crazy, uh, teleportation spell?”\nTo her surprise, the two took that at face value. The Drake looked at his companion and raised both brows, but not in disbelief.\n“Oh, a [Teleportation] spell? Was it a misfire or did someone target you? That’s a Mage’s Guild issue.”\n“Not if they did not cause it. Intriguing. Was it a magical duel, perhaps? Some high-level spellcasting?”\nThe terms were flying over Erin’s head, but she did her best to describe what happened.\n“Um. I didn’t see anything when it happened. I just sort of turned the corner and—look, the point is I suddenly appeared around here. And then…\nDragon.\n”\n“I told you. It’s flattering, but I’m not a Drag—oh.”\nThe ant man leaned forward.\n“Do you mean to say you found a\nDragon?\nSomewhere around this area? And you—survived the encounter. Unharmed?”\nHis voice was patently incredulous. Erin blinked.\n“Is, uh, that a bad thing? I mean, it’s a Dragon yeah, but isn’t he…?”\nBoth she and the ant man looked at the lizardman.\n“Look. It’s getting sort of embarrassing. I’m not a Dragon. I’m a Drake. And yeah, we’re distantly related cousins, but Dragons are…there’s no way. That would be huge. You said you saw one? You sure it wasn’t a Wyvern? It was probably a Wyvern.”\nErin vaguely knew that word, but she shook her head adamantly.\n“It breathed at me. Fire. And then I was chased by little green men.”\n“Goblins. And by the way, some Wyverns breathe fire too.”\n“So they\nare\nGoblins. But—well, hold on—then I found a giant dino-bird—”\n“A what?”\n“A big…big leathery thing. With wings.”\n“Oh, right. Those annoying things. What’re they called, Klbkch?”\nThe insect person looked up from his plate and replied calmly. He had a notepad open next to his meal and was taking notes. Was he writing with a…quill? And inkpot? Erin was fascinated.\n“Razorbeaks. Go on, Miss.”\nThere wasn’t much else to say. Erin tried to summarize the rest of it.\n“Well, after I got the eggs, there was a crab rock, I mean, a rock crab, and then I found blue fruits before that and…I met you two. A not-dragon and an insect. Who don’t want to eat me? Or is that after the meal?”\nThe lizard guy looked shocked and offended.\n“Of course we wouldn’t eat you! That’s barbaric, and besides, it’s illegal. I mean, okay, sure, it happens sometimes in distant villages, but we wouldn’t do that. Right, Klbkch?”\nThe lizard man turned to his friend.\n“Indeed. We would not violate our duty as guardsmen.”\n“Your duty? You’re…guardsmen? And you…you’re K—kbch?”\nThe insect man raised one hand instantly and bowed slightly in his seat.\n“Our pardons. We have not introduced ourselves. Allow me to correct this mistake. I am Klbkch, Senior Guardsman in the employ of the City of Liscor. This is my partner, also a Senior Guardsman.”\nHe nudged the Drake, and the other one looked up from sucking down a huge mouthful of noodles.\n“Relc!”\nThe lizardman raised his glass.\n“And this blue juice tastes good!”\n“Indeed. And I must apologize again, but our true intent in coming here was to ascertain the danger posed here.”\nErin looked around.\n“From what? Me?”\nThe Drake shrugged, picking at his teeth with a claw and glancing around.\n“Not you, specifically. Really, it could be anything. We thought it might be a random fire or a few Goblins. If there were some stupid kids, on the other hand, we’d be dragging them back right now since it’s dangerous to stay here. Bandits on the other hand…”\nErin met his gaze in alarm. He had very yellow eyes with black pupils.\n“Danger? Why danger? Is there something wrong with me staying here?”\n“Well, there’s nothing wrong with you staying here. Aside from dying, that is.”\n“Dying?”\nRelc kicked Klbkch under the table. Erin noticed the motion and the slight impact.\n“It’s just a possibility. This, uh, place is sort of bad. For your health.”\nErin looked blank. Klbkch cut in.\n“The plague. This location was once a small community until everyone here died. Horribly. Admittedly, this was a decade ago, but it was evacuated and has been condemned since then.”\nErin put her head in her hands.\n“So am I going to die by puking out my guts or something?”\n“Actually, the plague symptoms manifested themselves as—”\nRelc kicked Klbkch again.\n“Why don’t you shut up and let me talk? Look, Miss Human. You’re probably not sick if you’re still walking around.”\n“And not oozing.”\n“\nShut up.\nAhem. We were just sent here to make sure no Goblins or nasty creatures started living here. We’ve got no problem with Humans. Well, at least the non-violent kind.”\n“Indeed. There is no law against occupying this area.”\nThey both stared at her. Erin felt compelled to speak.\n“Good. Thanks?”\n“Right.”\n“Indeed.”\n“…Want another plate of pasta?”\nThe Drake had eaten most of his, and he looked fairly satisfied if how much he’d put away was anything to go by. He brightened up, and the Klbkch-person raised his hand politely as well.\n“Oh, sure.”\n“I will have another as well.”\nErin ladled noodles onto each plate. The diners were silent for a moment as each slurped down their noodles, or in the case of Klbkch, did something complex with his mouth-hole. Erin didn’t look closer.\nAfter a while, Relc put down his fork.\n“This really is quite good. How’d you make this all the way out here?”\n“Oh, I found some flour and butter and stuff in one of the cupboards. It had a runey…thing on the shelves.”\n“That would be a preservation spell. It is quite common among higher-class establishments.”\n“But you cooked it, then? Do you have levels in a [Chef] class, then?”\nErin stared at Relc.\n“Levels? Oh. No. I’ve got levels in, uh, [Innkeeper].”\nHe blinked at her, but idly, as if they were just making passing conversation and this wasn’t amazing.\n“Oh, I see, I see. That’s convenient. Did you earn them here?”\n“Uh, yeah. Every time I fell asleep I kept leveling. I’m, uh, level 4.”\n“Not bad! Especially if you just got here a few days ago. Did the notification wake you up right as you were falling asleep? I hate that.”\n“It did.”\n“It’s very annoying.”\n“Yeah. It is.”\nThe two looked at each other as Klbkch continued to eat in silence. Erin coughed into one hand and decided now was the time.\n“So. Leveling. Classes.”\nRelc blinked, then tapped at his chest with a grin.\n“What about it? Oh, are you wondering about mine? I’m a [Spearmaster]. This idiot’s a [Swordslayer]. We both have levels in [Guardsman] as well, but not nearly as much as our primary classes. Pretty cool, huh?”\nHe grinned and was clearly waiting for some reaction. Erin hesitated.\n“Right, right. Um, good to know.”\nShe smiled uncertainly, and he deflated a bit.\n“Uh—thanks. [Spearmaster]. Me. Him—[Swordslayer]. No, it’s cool. We’re [Guards]. Yeah.”\nRelc coughed a few times into his claw and glanced at her.\n“And you’re an [Innkeeper], right? Got any other classes?”\n“Um, no. No.”\nAnother quick glance. Klbkch and Relc hesitated, and the Drake shrugged.\n“So four levels in…? That’s too bad. But you’re young; leveling takes time after all.”\n“Okay. Right. Um. Let’s pretend I have no idea what leveling or classes are. I’m, uh, from really far away, and we have different…traditions.”\nRelc and Klbkch exchanged a glance.\n“…You mean you don’t level in this Michigan place?”\n“Oh no, no. We level, it’s just, uh, different from you guys. And I never paid much attention in school and all that…”\nThis time, the look she got was ranging beyond skeptical into incredulous. Relc sat back with a frown and popped another sliver of sausage into his mouth.\n“They have to teach Humans how to level?\nWeird.\n”\nKlbkch agreed, although he gave Erin a look of what might have even been sympathy.\n“That is unusual. I was under the impression levels worked uniformly across all species. However, I too understand the issues of communicating leveling and the system of classes. Even so, it is odd to think there is a nation that does not teach it in some way. Unless you are referring to a cultural difference in classes?”\nErin had no idea what that meant. She spread her hands on the table, looking from face to face.\n“Yes. No. Maybe? Look, I level. You level. We level. Everyone levels, right? We all can level up in, uh, classes and gain skills. How am I doing so far?”\nRelc nodded amiably. He was slurping down noodles with his long tongue. Erin was fascinated, although she wasn’t sure if he was being disgusting or not.\n“That’s pretty much how it works. What were you confused about?”\n“Um. I gained levels just from cleaning an inn. And I wasn’t an [Innkeeper] before this. So why…?”\nRelc waved a claw airily.\n“Oh,\nthat\n. New classes without an apprenticeship, you mean? Simple. You must have satisfied the requirements for the class, that’s all. I know it’s sort of weird gaining a new class suddenly, but it happens. I knew a guy who gained four levels in [Farmer] just because he kept growing carrots in pots next to his window. Not [Gardener], [Farmer]. I guess it was because he grew lots of carrots. Leveling is weird that way.”\n“So…okay, let me think.”\nErin had to massage her head while the two guardsmen looked at her in concern. Well, she assumed they were looks of concern.\n“This is a world. Everyone levels in it. Humans, lizard people, talking insects, cats, dogs, Goblins…”\n“Hey, what did you just call—”\nKlbkch leaned forward, cutting Relc off.\n“Actually, I would like to correct you on that point. While the thinking races may level, animals and even creatures such as Dragons are not capable of leveling. Which is common knowledge.”\nThey were giving her very, very strange looks. Erin hesitated, but she was already in too deep, so she decided she had to gain as much information as possible.\n“What, really? How about Goblins?”\n“They can level. Now, about what you just said. I’m not a\nlizard—\n”\n“Indeed. It is part of our shared past. Once, of course, all races fought with tooth and claw and magic, but then they divided. Those who decided to forsake their natures and pursue a different truth received the gift of leveling, while those creatures who stayed true to their nature kept the might of their natures instead. According to historical records, at least. It is the subject of some studies, but that is the consensus.”\n“Really? So that means—”\n“\nHey!\n”\nRelc’s fist smashed into the table. Every plate on the table jumped into the air, and Erin nearly fell out of her chair. She looked at Relc. He was scowling, but when he glanced at her pale face, he stopped and looked guilty.\n“Um. Sorry about that. Really. But, uh, can we talk about that name?”\n“N-name?”\n“Yeah. You, um, called me a lizard person, right?”\n“Is that wrong?”\n“…Yes. Yes, it is. I’m a Drake, not one of the Lizardfolk. There’s a big difference.”\n“Sorry. Sorry about that.”\n“Uh, don’t apologize. Look, maybe I overreacted a bit. I’m not, uh, mad…”\nKlbkch kicked Relc under the table.\n“I believe it was my turn to do that. Apologize to the Human for your rudeness.”\n“…Yeah, sorry.”\nRelc bowed his head down low, until the neck spines along the back of his head were pointing at the ceiling. Erin waved her hands urgently.\n“Oh no, no. Please don’t do that. I didn’t know it was so rude. If I’d have known, I’d have never—there’s a big difference between lizard people and Drakes, right?”\nKlbkch raised one finger politely.\n“Only a few differences, but the animosity between their cultures is—”\nErin saw Relc go for a huge kick, but Klbkch swung his legs up, and Relc glared at him until he was quiet. The Drake turned back to Erin huffily, and she realized this was an important issue to him.\n“\nShut up\n. I’m still sorry. But yeah, there’s a big difference. I mean, sure, Humans say we look similar, but we’re totally different. They have those neck frills, and they’re way too colorful. We build cities out of proper stone, but the Lizardfolk live near water and can breathe underwater too, some of them. They have Naga and, like, jungles in Baleros. Whereas we Drakes like drier climates. We enjoy warm sun, open spaces…”\n“Nice rocks to laze about upon while we should be performing our duties.”\n“You’re just an overgrown ant. You be quiet. Anyways, we’re special. Those guys are just amphibians that learned to walk on two legs.\nWe’re\nrelated to Dragons. We’ve got special powers.”\n“Like what?”\n“We can breathe fire. Some of us can, at least.”\nRelc sat back and folded his arms with a triumphant grin. Erin and Klbkch stared at him in silence.\n“What? It’s a great power!”\n“I am sure it is.”\n“Yeah. That sounds amazing. Really…really cool!”\nRelc nudged Klbkch with a triumphant smile of approval.\n“See? She gets it. Told you it was cool.”\n“Yeah, it’s awesome.”\n“I feel I must mention that you, personally, cannot breathe fire, Relc.”\n“Shut up, Klbkch!”\nRelc looked annoyed and embarrassed at the same time.\n“Only a few Drakes can do it, okay? Not breathing fire is perfectly normal. And some of us can, so there.”\nHe looked at Erin anxiously.\n“We’re still cool, right?”",

    "text": "Erin grinned and gave him a thumbs up. Then she winced in regret. She’d used her bad hand. The Drake focused on the bloody bandages with a trained eye and suddenly frowned and leaned forwards.\n“Ooh, nasty. What happened there? Looks like a bad cut. Were those Goblins?”\n“What, this? It’s nothing, it—”\nKlbkch stood up suddenly. Erin flinched, but he raised two of his spindly arms.\n“Please, I mean no harm. But your hand. May I see it?”\nErin hesitated. Then she slowly extended her hand. On the outside, her bandage was grey and red with congealed blood. Some dripped to the floor. Relc winced, but Klbkch studied the injury carefully without touching it. Then he looked up.\n“Again, apologies. But could I trouble you to remove the bandage?”\nErin hesitated. But then she slowly unwrapped her hand. And flinched. The pain that had been slumbering in her hand suddenly flared, and something dripped to the floor.\nIt was yellowish-white pus. It dripped from her wound. And the wound itself was different. Instead of the thin red line, it had changed. Parts of the injury were darker red and—Erin looked away.\nRelc hissed softly. However, Klbkch made no sound. He inspected her wound for a few seconds, his antennae moving slowly, and then looked at her.\n“Yeah. Um, yeah.”\nErin tried to breathe. Her hand was suddenly burning.\n“It—sorry, it’s a mess. I cut my hand, and I guess it just got infected, but—”\n“It is not an infection.”\n“What?”\n“It is poison. Of a sort.”\n“You sure? It doesn’t feel like—”\n“There is a fish in the rivers near here. It secretes a mucus that damages the area it touches. Such as in this case. I have seen several similar afflictions as a guardsman.”\n“You have? I mean, it’s not an infection?”\nErin was trembling. The insect man held her gently.\n“Please, do not be alarmed. This is treatable. Allow me.”\nHe reached down. Erin looked and saw him pull something out of a belt pouch at his waist. She blinked as he held up a bottle full of a shimmering, emerald-green liquid.\n“This is a low-grade healing potion. If you pour it over your injury, it should heal your affliction.”\nRelc opened his mouth, but the bug man turned his head, and the Drake hesitated.\n“Yep. Good thing it’s meant to treat light infections too. Klb, are you going to…?”\nKlbkch didn’t respond. Gently, he uncorked the bottle and held it out to Erin. She accepted it gingerly, but hesitated.\n“This is—I mean, is it safe? For Humans?”\nKlbkch and Relc both nodded. Relc was eying his partner, but the ant man was intent.\n“Please, believe me. It will heal you.”\nErin stared into his eyes. They were compound eyes, large ones. Brown and fractal. Like an ant’s. And they were creepy as hell, but Erin decided she could still trust them.\nShe gripped the potion tightly in her right hand and poured it slowly over the open wound on her left hand. She gasped in shock. Klbkch instantly checked her hand.\n“Are you alright?”\n“It—it doesn’t hurt!”\nRelc snorted gently. It sounded like a leaf blower starting up.\n“Of course not. Why would anyone make a healing potion that hurts when you use it? But look at that!”\nHe pointed. Erin’s eyes went down to the cut in her hand. It was closing up with amazing speed. The flesh was joining together, and in an instant, the entire cut vanished. She gaped.\nKlbkch plucked the half-empty bottle from her hands before she dropped it. She was too busy poking at her hand to realize, but when he’d stoppered the bottle, she turned and gave him a huge hug.\n“Thank you—ow!”\n“Apologies. It is unwise to hug those with exoskeletons. Please, are you hurt?”\nErin stood back and rubbed at where his pointy bits had poked her.\n“No, no I’m not. And how can I—I can’t thank you enough. That—that was a healing potion, right? How can I repay you for—”\nShe cast around for something to give him, but Klbkch held up one of his…hands.\n“Please, it was nothing. That was merely a low-grade healing potion of no great worth. Let us call it payment for the meal. Unless, of course, you object?”\nErin looked around, flustered, and shook her head rapidly.\n“Oh no,\nthank you\n. I mean, this is probably worth—can I get you another plate? Or—or you could come back. I’ll feed you two again if you want—”\n“I will accept gladly. But for now I am full, and I believe it is time to be going. We would not wish to intrude upon your hospitality for too long.”\nRelc paused as he gulped down more blue fruit juice.\n“We wouldn’t?”\nHis partner turned to face him, looking the same, but he lowered his mandibles and he\nsounded\nmildly exasperated.\n“We are still on duty, if you recall. The Captain will be expecting a report. If we do return, we will have more time to socialize.”\nRelc considered this with a nod for logic. Then he held up a finger.\n“Or, and hear me out. Or…we could have more food and stay here longer.”\nKlbkch stared at him until the finger lowered by itself.\n“I am sure you would prefer that. But we are being paid to work, not to enjoy ourselves. Moreover, you are eating all of this Human’s dinner.”\nRelc glanced at the table. He stood up immediately.\n“Right. Well, let’s be going. Um, sorry about that, Miss. Here, let me just pay for the food…”\nErin tried to protest, but a scaly hand prized hers open gently and deposited several copper coins and two silver ones into her palm.\n“I insist. That blue drink is really good, by the way.”\n“Thanks.”\n“Well, we’ll be off then. Good night to you.”\nThe two left the inn. Erin watched them go. The door closed, and she heard them speaking lightly about reporting back and filing…\nThen she heard nothing at all. Erin went to go sit down and ended up sitting on the floor. She stared at the door. She stayed sitting for another hour in complete, stunned, gratified shock.\nWhat just happened?",

    "text": "Relc and Klbkch left the inn. They began walking through the grass under the night sky. It was cool, but both moved quickly. Each one scanned the landscape as they walked and kept their hands on the spear and swords at their sides. They weren’t nervous, just wary.\nHowever, they were also moving a lot faster than average to get back to the city before complete nightfall; they had to clock out and file that report. This patrol had taken longer than they thought, but they were so busy thinking that it took five minutes before Relc finally broke the silence. He turned to Klbkch and murmured.\n“What a lonely girl.”\n“Is she female? I could not tell with complete accuracy. She sounded so, but I have met few Humans in social settings.”\nRelc nodded wisely and glanced over his shoulder.\n“I can. It’s the things on her chest.”\n“Mammary glands? Breasts, I think they’re referred to. Or maybe the word is tits.”\nRelc hesitated.\n“Really? I thought those were birds.”\nKlbkch shrugged.\n“That is what I heard some small Humans saying once. But she’s female. And young, correct?”\nThe Drake nodded slowly, frowning back at the old inn.\n“Yeah, I’d bet on it. I’m not sure why a Human would be out here anyways, let alone in that place.”\nKlbkch shrugged.\n“Inquiring into others’ personal affairs is only a matter for the Guards while we’re on duty. Respecting another’s personal space is a principle of social interaction.”\nRelc elbowed him, but Klbkch had sidled out of range.\n“Shut up. She just seems lonely, that’s all. Why else would a Human female want to hang out with a Drake and an overgrown bug?”\nKlbkch was silent for a while.\n“Do you believe she is a lawbreaker or fearful for her life?”\nRelc shook his head again.\n“Even if she was, who’d hide there? You’d have to be mad, or be a [Warrior] or [Survivor] to want to live by yourself. Plus, the plague! Do I look sick? Am I oozing?”\nThe Drake checked himself with vague paranoia, but Klbkch shook his head.\n“It was almost certainly safe as I and Watch Captain Zevara assured you repeatedly, Relc. Besides, that young woman’s presence is proof enough. She would be dead within the day if the disease were still present.”\n“Bet she didn’t know. And her expression when we walked in—she’s never seen a Drake or an Ant before in her life. Well, the Ant part makes sense.”\n“I would prefer that you call my species by their proper name.”\nRelc ignored that. He glanced over his shoulder.\n“What do you think? I bet she’s some kind of runaway or a child that got separated from her clan. Do Humans have clans? Or is it all [Lords] and [Ladies]? Maybe she’s not even from this continent.”\nHe waited for more speculation, but the ant man had turned his head and was refusing to speak. Relc glowered, but then grudgingly snapped.\n“Fine.\nAntinium.\nHappy?”\nKlbkch replied at once, as if nothing had happened.\n“Her being a runaway would be most likely. I find it hard to believe any Human would wander so far into the grasslands by accident, and she did not seem to be looking for directions. Her magical teleportation story is also possible, but why would she not have asked to be taken to the Mage’s Guild? It is clearly a cover story.”\n“Bastard.”\n“You are correct in at least one definition of the word. But speculation is pointless in any case. We investigated the smoke, and now we can make our report. She is not breaking the law since the inn was abandoned nearly ten years ago.”\n“What about the Dragon? Do you think she made that up?”\nKlbkch hesitated and glanced at Relc. His pincers made a\nclicking\nsound as they came together in thought.\n“She was not lying, at least not intentionally. But it is possible she was mistaken.”\n“Yeah. A Dragon? Really?”\nRelc laughed, and the Antinium shrugged.\n“It seems more likely that she was hallucinating. However…she may have run into a fire-breathing salamander. I cannot imagine she would survive an encounter with a real Dragon. Armies would not.”\n“Plus, we’d know if a Dragon lived around here. They’re pretty obvious.”\n“…Indeed.”\nMore silence. At last, Relc summed up the contents of their report.\n“So…scared Human female? Not a threat? Probably a traveller? Makes good pasta?”\n“That was my assessment.”\n“Right, right. Let’s tell the Captain and get some sleep. Or rather, I’ll sleep and you do—whatever Ants do to sleep. Sitting-sleeping or whatever.”\n“Agreed. And it is very restful. You should attempt it sometime.”\n“Pass.”\nThe two walked in silence for quite some time. The road back to the city was long, and in any case, they were still alert for potential dangers that might be sneaking up on them. Not that either had much to fear from most predators so long as they kept their eyes and earholes open, but you never knew.\nAfter a long time, Klbkch broke the silence.\n“So, shall we return tomorrow?”\nRelc blinked and looked at his partner in disbelief. Because he had been about to say the exact same thing, and he was sure Klbkch would shoot it down.\n“Oh, definitely. Right after work?”\n“We may be able to fit checking in there as part of our duties if we convince the Captain it is necessary.”\nRelc slapped Klbkch on the back of his shell in delight.\n“Klb! That’s so devious! We can waste hours and say it was all an investigation! Now you’re thinking like a Drake!”\n“I will endeavor not to in the future.”\n“Go roast yourself.”\nThey walked on for another few minutes until Relc broke the silence again. There was just one last thing he had to bring up. He eyed his partner, looking amused, but Klbkch refused to respond. Relc indicated the empty bottle hanging at Klbkch’s belt.\n“So, a lesser healing potion of no worth, huh? You know, I’ve never heard you lie like that.”\nThe Antinium’s voice was calm as he replied.\n“Would you have had me tell her the true value?”\n“No, no. It’s for the best. Mind you, I think she figured it out.”\n“…Perhaps.”\n“How are you going to explain\nthat\nto the Captain, huh? That’s supposed to be special-issue. We won’t even get another shipment of that quality for months, probably! All the way from Pallass once the Blood Fields are frozen.”\nThe Antinium was unmoved.\n“I did not believe a lesser one would be worth the risk. I shall make do with a replacement, and I will deduct the cost from my pay. Besides which, it was used to protect a civilian.”\nRelc rolled his eyes.\n“You’re a regular do-gooder, huh? Trying to level up your…[Good Person] class? Is that a class?”\n“You know fully well that I have no levels in any class of the kind. I was merely being kind.”\n“Sure,\nsuuuure\nyou were.”\n“I have no sexual attraction towards Humans. Unlike you.”\n“\nMe?\nI don’t like Humans. They’re scaleless, hairy, and they smell funny. I mean, this one’s nice, but I definitely wouldn’t want to see what it looks like under those clothes.”\n“Mm. It’s not very interesting. They are very fleshy.”\n“Ew.”\n“Indeed.”\nThe two walked on in silence. Eventually, Relc spoke again.\n“—It’s not that I’m not interested. I have an open mind! I wouldn’t mind looking. If I was offered. They’ve got nothing on good scales, but I could get over the fleshiness. Maybe.”\n“Deviant.”\n“Shut up.”\nThe two were almost in sight of the walls now, and Relc waved up at the figures watching them. He turned to Klbkch, but the inn wasn’t even visible from here. The Drake smiled, and Klbkch nodded.\n“She was quite interesting in any case. It was pleasant talking to her.”\nRelc sighed.\n“Yeah. Yeah, I’m glad we didn’t have to kill her.”\n“Indeed.”",

But when she eventually got up and ate breakfast, she got around to the big smile.\nIt came when she was eating more blue fruit and she realized she was using two hands. Erin had to stop and stare at her left palm for a while. She poked the clean, unscarred, uncut skin and grinned.\n“Healing potions are awesome.”\nShe sat back in her chair, flexing her healed hand. It didn’t hurt. It was amazing how much it didn’t hurt. And she owed it all to a giant ant man and a lizard…Drake.

    "text": "It was an uneventful trip to the blue fruit trees. As Erin gazed up at the blue fruits, she wondered for the first time how many there were left to eat. She counted.\n“…Looks like I’ve got a few weeks before I run out. But bleh, eating just blue fruit all the time would be disgusting. At least there’s some ingredients left for pasta if I can find more eggs.”\nBut what would happen when her small cupboard ran out? What then?\nErin touched the pocket of her jeans and heard the\nclink\nof coins. Right, she had some money. But how much was it? And more importantly, how could she spend it? It wasn’t as if she could eat metal.\nGrumbling to herself, Erin loaded up with blue fruits. It was getting annoying carrying them all by hand. She dropped a lot of them, which bruised the skin and made the fruit taste mushy. So why not try making something?\nErin stared at the ground. She had…grass. She stared at the trees. She had wood. But she had no way of cutting that wood, so it was no good. She didn’t know how to make things. Even if you gave her…rope, or string, and pieces of wood or something, Erin didn’t see how that equated to a basket.\nYet as she stared at the grass, something in Erin’s head lit up. She frowned suddenly.\n“Wait a second. Maybe that\ncould\nwork. Let’s see. If I take this long grass and tie this knot here…”\nErin hunkered down and started picking the longer clumps of grass and testing their durability. She started tying knots and cutting with the knife.\nKnots?\nErin knew the most basic, weakest knots where you just folded two sides of string over each other and the shoelace knot, but she couldn’t tie that unless she had a…shoe. However, suddenly, she was weaving the grass together in ways she hadn’t thought of. But now that she was doing it—it was obvious. If you had big pieces of fabric, string, or grass, of\ncourse\nyou could tie them together to form a net. And that would be the base of your basket…\nIt was like someone had bridged the tentative idea from what she needed with actual understanding. Erin found she had to focus on her task—she couldn’t just go on autopilot, but at the same time there was a certainty in what she was doing. And in less than twenty minutes, she was looking at a basket made of grass.\n“Whoa.”\nErin held up the basket and inspected it. It was lightweight, but durable. Wide strands at the bottom wove together to form a decent mesh, and it even had a handle made of three big leaves braided together! She experimentally tossed all the blue fruits she’d gathered into it and lifted it. The grass basket pulled downwards, but the woven handle didn’t tear.\nIt was a real basket. Made of grass.\nWas it tacky? Yes. Did she feel like she should be dancing with pom poms on a deserted island? Yes. Was that a terrible thought to have? Probably. And should she feel ashamed of herself? Erin already was. But she had a basket.\nAnd more importantly, she had a plan.\nWhat could you do with a basket? Well, you could eat and walk at the same time since you had a free hand. Erin cored a few blue fruits and hung on to the seed pods. Then she went looking for eggs.\nIt took her about an hour before she found another nest. When she spotted the telltale brown shape hunkering in the long grass, Erin stomped over, making as much noise as possible.\nThis time, the thing that erupted from the grass didn’t fly away immediately. Instead, the dino-bird\nscreeched\nand dove at her. Erin stood her ground, reached into her basket, and threw a seed core.\nShe missed.\nBut the flying object spooked the bird. The giant pterodactyl wavered and then flew away as Erin hurled more seed cores at it. She laughed triumphantly and rushed to grab the eggs.\nThat was when the bird turned around and flew at her, pecking and trying to bite her. It wasn’t afraid of the seed cores after all. And it had a sharp beak.",

She wanted nothing more than to get some cold water on them. Too bad there were more suspicious rocks in the way. Actually, there were about six of them, spaced out across the grasslands. Well, her trick hadn’t worked on the bird, but rock crabs were a different matter.\nOn her way back, Erin pasted two of the rock crabs with the slimy seed cores when they shuffled at her.

    "text": "The next hour saw her kneeling at the stream, gargling water, puking it up, and watching out for the crazy fish. Fortunately, they didn’t seem inclined to get near her. Actually, she saw one swim towards her and start nibbling at the contents of her stomach as it washed downstream. That was gross.\nErin washed her mouth and hands off for the tenth time and felt the shaking and nausea stop a bit.\n“What—what was that?”\nErin could only mumble as she stared into the water. She moved her head—not so much out of desire for movement as to watch for the dangerous flatfish.\nThe fish that had been eating her vomit was floating belly-up in the water. Erin saw the other fish were avoiding it just like they were avoiding her.\n“…Poison. Gotta be.”\nBut what had it come from?\nAs she lay there, the young woman tried to identify the causes. Her first thought was the pasta. The pasta, sausages…\nThe plague?\nBut no, Klbkch had said if she was\noozing\nshe was sick. This felt like bad food poisoning. It could be the pasta. Or—or was she sick because of contact with the Drake guy? The bug-people might have horrible diseases.\nYet the fish was dead. So that felt more like it was something Erin had eaten. So, logically, she had two culprits.\nPasta made of dino eggs and sausage. Or…the blue fruits.\nGiven both as options, Erin knew which one she suspected. But she didn’t eat the seed cores! Were the blue fruits dangerous?\nOn a vague hunch, Erin looked around and saw the basket of blue fruits still lying on the ground where she’d dropped them to be sick in the stream. She picked one up and stared at it.\n“You look innocent. But maybe…”\nShe did exactly what she normally did to eat it, except with her fingers instead of teeth. Erin delved into the pulpy fruit, resisting the urge to take a bite, and stared at the seed core inside.\nIt looked like it wasn’t broken.\nIt looked, therefore, like this fruit was good. On a hunch, Erin tossed the blue fruit pieces into the stream. They sank a bit in the clear water, and she wondered if the water was bad too—she should have really boiled everything she drank. However, she had the most suspicion about the seed cores that scared the rock crabs so much.\nThe first flatfish had been avoiding her and whatever had killed its friend, but it apparently had short-term memory problems because it ungainly leapt and swallowed the pieces of the blue fruit she tossed into the water. Erin watched it as it spat out a bit, but apparently decided the rest was digestible, even if it wasn’t the flesh it so clearly craved.\n“Okay. How about…”\nThe seed core didn’t crack as she gently lobbed it into the water and bobbed down the brisk current. The fish investigated it—and to Erin’s amusement, gingerly closed its teeth around the seed core and gave it a tentative nibble. It crunched down the seed core then began to spit out fragments and a bit of ugly greenish-blue from the pulp. All four eyes swung around crazily as the awkward fish shook its body in clear revulsion.\n“Must taste bad, huh?”\nThe fish zoomed around unhappily as Erin watched. Then it grew slower, and Erin saw it open its mouth wide and then it began\nvomiting\nthe contents of its stomach up. She watched a replay of what had happened to her. Only this time—within two minutes—the fish was dead.\nA chill ran down Erin’s back as she saw the second corpse floating downstream. Those fish weren’t as big as her, but that one had eaten\none\nseed core and—she looked down at the blue fruits in horror.\nNo wonder the dino birds, rock crabs, or other animals, even birds and worms and stuff, didn’t try to eat them! Only she was stupid enough to try—and the Goblins. She must have been\nlucky!\nSome of the seed cores must have leaked poison or something into some of the fruits she ate so she didn’t notice due to the sweet taste.\nAnd then I eat too many and die. Only, I was spared because of random chance.\nErin shuddered. She clenched her hands.\nIt wasn’t fair!\nHer one secure food source,\ngood\n-tasting food, turned out to be poison. It was just like the acid flies, the fish, the cupboard—everything was out to get her.\nExcept for the two friendly [Guards], and they were gone. Erin put her head down.\n“Do I just eat what’s in the cupboard and fight dino-birds? If I can’t eat the blue fruits…”\nHer survival chances were dropping rapidly. Yet Erin looked at the basket of inviting blue fruits and saw them completely differently. No longer this world’s versions of apples or oranges—they were alien fruits, and she was lucky she hadn’t died eating the first one.\nGlumly, Erin was about to toss all the blue fruits in the stream when she decided she could at least harvest the definitely-deadly poisonous cores as a rock crab deterrent. Then, as she was lying there, trying not to cry or puke—she heard a sound.\nIt sounded like—Erin sat up.\nOh no. Not now.\nShe scrambled around and then crawled over to an incline and rolled down the other side.\nGoblins.",

    "text": "The band of Goblins were six in total. Three with weapons, three with baskets of their own. In fact…they even looked vaguely familiar. One had a lot of bruises, and Erin recognized it as the one she’d slapped—mainly from the huge mark on its face.\nThe non-combatants were odder. They were small, wearing ragged, dirty clothes that looked far too big for them. One, for instance, had what was just a tunic for a regular person dragging on the ground, it was so short.\nThose were the ones carrying baskets.\nGrass baskets,\nlike Erin’s. And in fact—they had buckets too. Buckets made of what looked like…Erin hesitated as she peeked up from the lip of the slope she was hiding behind.\nShells?\nIt looked like some kind of chitin. Not the Klbkch guy; it was too small, and too…she hesitated.\nIt looked like a spider shell, only hollowed and taped together with something sticky to make a crude basin. A big,\nbig\nspider.\nAs it turned out, the Goblins were using it to collect water. They gazed around furtively as their leader poked the others and pointed.\nThey didn’t speak that Erin heard, only dipped their containers into the water. And—she noticed—they had baskets of blue fruit too.\nThe young woman realized she was occupying the exact same ecological niche as Goblins. That didn’t make her feel great, but they hadn’t seen her; for once, the unique topography of this area meant that she was less than twenty feet away and invisible unless they climbed up and saw her from above.\nShe hoped they wouldn’t take long to do their business. Then Erin hoped they didn’t use the stream as anything like a restroom. Or even bath, because she might be downriver of them! Then issues of hygiene and water contamination fled her mind as she heard a snarl.\nOne of the Goblins had found her grass basket. And spotted one of the dead fish floating downriver. It pointed at the basket, and all the Goblins looked up. Erin tensed as they investigated. She was still feeling vomit-y, but she had been healed and there were only three with knives. If it came to it—she could definitely run away and get to the inn.\nBut what were they doing?\nThey were investigating the basket, poking each other and making odd gestures, again, completely in silence. Then the smallest Goblin did something that fascinated Erin.",

    "text": "The littlest Goblin hated getting water. It was heavy, and the big Goblins made her carry it. But she couldn’t fight well, and sometimes they had to fight spiders or other things. And they hit her if she complained.\nThey’d already gotten blue fruits, and the basket was heavy, so the little Goblin kept trying to hang it on different limbs as they went to fill the buckets. She felt like if she carried it on her\nback\n, she wouldn’t hurt her arms.\nBut when one of the Goblins who could make baskets saw her fraying the grass with her efforts, she hit the littlest Goblin, and the sniffing little Goblin carried her burdens in silence.\nThey were lucky; there was nothing hunting them when they got to the stream. After a few big mouthfuls of water, the group was ready to bring water back to the tribe and [Chieftain] when they found the basket.\nThat was odd. One of the warriors pointed at the basket, and all six Goblins checked themselves. Three had baskets of blue fruit, and the other three didn’t carry baskets.\nBut there were…one…two…three…four baskets. The lead Goblin was suspicious as the littlest Goblin looked around. There were no more Goblins gathering food, much less the blue fruits. Had one forgotten a basket?\nIt looked—good. Well-made. Most of the other Goblins who could craft baskets were lazy and made cheap ones because they fell apart soon. This one was nice, and the littlest Goblin wanted it.\nPerhaps someone had forgotten it here. The bigger Goblins decided it was more food, and who cared where it came from? That meant one less Goblin had to make a trip to get the blue fruits.\nIt didn’t seem to occur to them that maybe it hadn’t come from Goblins at all. The littlest Goblin tugged at arms and pointed urgently.\nWhat if it came from the inn?\nWhat if the Human had made it?\nThe others laughed silently in her face. Humans had real baskets of wood and metal! The littlest Goblin thought it made sense. The Human girl had been around the blue fruits\nand\nshe was at that inn.\nBut they just poked her, and since her idea was stupid,\nshe\nhad to carry both baskets\nand\nthe water.\nThat was so unfair the littlest Goblin protested. She swung her fists wildly at one of the warriors, who kicked her into the stream. She had to swim out before the fish got her and lay, sulking, on the ground. However, her defiance had worked, and the grumbling warriors decided one of them would carry the water bucket.\nBut she still had to carry both baskets! The littlest Goblin decided that was the best she could get, so she rolled around in the grass as one of the older Goblins who gathered fruits all the time decided to inspect the mysterious extra basket. Instantly, the [Gatherer]’s face twisted up, and the older Goblin snapped at the littlest Goblin to come over and help.\nSome of the fruits were bad.\nWhat idiot Goblin had harvested these?",

Plus her food was being taken. Her—admittedly poisonous blue fruits.\nOkay, they could have that, but please, leave the basket!\nErin watched as an older Goblin with what looked like a spider’s claw shoved through her black hair as a…hairpin?…investigated the basket.\nThen she seemed upset and made a loud\neigk-ing\nsound, the first sound any Goblin had really made aside from chortles or grunts, and beckoned the little Goblin over. To Erin’s indignation, she began tossing blue fruits out of the basket!\nThe little Goblin seemed as confused as Erin.

    "text": "They were all poisonous. The littlest Goblin recoiled from one bad blue fruit and wiped her claws on her wet shirt as the [Gatherer] sorted the basket. It wasn’t just experience that told the older Goblin this.\nIt was her Skill.\n[Detect Poison]. These were bad, these were bad…by the time she sorted the basket, only the fruits without a trace of badness were left. Half were scattered on the ground. She’d have to re-check these ones when they got back to the cave, too.\nThe littlest Goblin peered at the bad blue fruits. They didn’t\nseem\nbad to her. But she knew if you ate the nasty thing inside, you’d be dead in an hour. Bad, stomach-screaming, frothing-mouth-death.\nOne of the bad ways to go, even worse than spider-death. No, actually, spider-death seemed worse still, but both hurt a lot.\nThe little Goblin was curious, though, so as the older Goblins decided to take a break before heading back to their cave, she produced a tiny little knife and began opening the fruits. If these were bad…\nShe begged for one blue fruit, and since they had extra, all the Goblins ate one from the extra basket. They didn’t have to tell the [Chieftain]. The littlest Goblin cut them up and removed the seed cores and tossed them into the stream, and got to stare at the good blue fruits and the bad ones. She cut up three bad ones and then smiled.\nOh!\nThat was how it worked.\nThe bigger Goblins watched the small Goblin out of the corners of their eyes. She was very young and very odd. Even for small Goblins. She’d smile or stare at things that made no sense, or collect rocks and sticks.\nAnd now this? The littlest Goblin didn’t seem interested in eating the poisonous fruit, which was good, so they took a brief nap then left. They didn’t understand why she smiled.

    "text": "Erin felt like throwing up again by the time the Goblins had gone. Not because of them stealing her basket—the poison was still in her system.\nHowever, she was curious as to the little Goblin’s antics. She clearly knew the fruits lying all about were bad—and just as obviously, at least one of the Goblins had identified the poisonous ones.\n“Huh. Can Goblins smell poison? Wait…wait. That Relc guy said they have Skills. Do you get Skills to tell if there’s bad fruits? [Bad Fruit Detector]? No way.”\nBut how else would the other Goblins do that? Super-smell? If so, she should have picked up on Erin. The young woman didn’t know, but the little Goblin’s actions made her most curious. So she squatted down and stared at the pieces of blue fruit.\nShe was confused, not only by the blue fruit analysis, but by the Goblins. They were definitely horrible and had tried to kill her at least…\nfive\ntimes, but they had tools like buckets and even—it seemed—Skills. So they had classes, like Klbkch said.\nThey were still monsters, and Erin supposed even monsters had to eat. But even so—it was odd. Now, what had the little Goblin, the one wearing all rags, found?\nPerhaps it was nothing, but Erin had seen that smile of satisfaction. She peered for a long time at the ‘bad’ blue fruits.\n“I think I need to figure out what a good one looks like.”\nUnfortunately, the Goblins had eaten their snack and so Erin had to go all the way back to the blue fruit trees—carefully, watching out for crabs and Goblins. But since they’d already gone foraging, she reasoned they were unlikely to come back.\nShe did a round trip with an armful of fruits and sat, creating another basket by the river as she tried to cross-reference her fruits with the bad ones.\nThe problem was, Erin had no idea whether the fruits she\nhad\nwere good. She wished she had whatever the other Goblin had—a way to tell what was safe or not. That was a Skill, and Erin began understanding how valuable it was.\n“I could eat mushrooms! Or…maybe not mushrooms because ick. Or bugs? Wait—that’s just as bad. Plants, then. Herbs. And blue fruits. Okay—this fruit and this fruit and this fruit.”\nShe took three random ones from her collection and put them in the ‘I have no idea’ pile. Then she organized the ones the Goblin had opened in the ‘definitely probably deadly’ pile. After that? It was a game of spot the differences.\nEmbarrassingly, it took Erin over fifteen minutes, far longer than the little Goblin, to identify what the distinction was. And then of course she tested it by tossing it into the stream and watching which fish really seemed unhappy as the bad fruits ran through their system. Erin supposed many creatures that weren’t…people? Mammals? They seemed to suffer the effects of blue fruit poisoning a lot faster than her.\n“Aha! So that’s all it is?”\nMystified, Erin looked down at the bad fruits. She saw almost identical interiors to the good ones. You couldn’t\ntell\nif the seed cores were smashed and mixing with the fruit from the inside.\nAt least—not from the coloration of the blue fruit, or even the smell. Taste? The blue fruits were so sweet it’d be hard to identify, and by that point, you were putting poison in your mouth.\nThe trick had taken Erin a long while to figure out, but since she knew the little Goblin had seen something, she’d eventually begun prodding the pieces of fruit, wondering if it was just noticing bits of seed core.\nThen she saw the difference: all the bad blue fruits were wet. To be more precise, they were actively juicy. Blue liquid ran from the pieces, whereas the other blue fruits refused to produce juice except where they were torn and only when you chewed or mashed them up.\nErin had noticed when she made the blue fruit juice that she’d had to really\nmash\nthe pieces up to produce the juice. However, in the bad sample group, the fruits were actively watery.\n“Maybe the poison is making the fruit like—wetter? Or it’s making the fruit weaker?”\nOr perhaps the poison was\nkilling\nthe fruit rind outside the seed. The longer Erin stared, the more the bad fruits seemed to be actively going through rapid decomposition before her eyes. Turning to mushy, nasty pulp.\nThe blue fruits, the good ones, felt more like oranges in texture; you had to bite and extract the sweet. The bad ones were actively mushing due to the seed cores being compromised.\nErin’s test group of evil fishies certainly seemed to back up her findings; they kept eating the pieces of blue fruit she tossed to them, but they began spitting out the bad ones after a few bites.\nAs if they could also tell.\nWell, Erin didn’t want to rely on Goblins and biting fish for evidence of poison, but she had to admit—they seemed to have figured it out.\nShe gathered up all the remaining blue fruits thoughtfully and put them in her basket. She’d check them all before eating back at the inn. And she’d eat very, very sparingly of the ones that looked good, juice-test or no.\nIf she got sick, hopefully it would only be lightly. Erin didn’t relish that, but she’d rely on pasta and eggs over the blue fruits for a few days. At least she had something to try.\n“And all because of that little Goblin. Huh.”\nErin stared back at where the Goblins had been. That was the most pleasant encounter she’d had with them—mostly because they hadn’t known she was here. Then a thought occurred to her, and her face fell.\n“Aw. No. Oh no. Am I…dumber than Goblins?”",

    "text": "Senior Guardsman Relc stretched in his chair in the Guard’s barracks. It wasn’t too crowded in the early evening, most [Guards] having checked out already or begun their evening patrols. Those who remained in the building were almost entirely Drakes, aside from a few tall, furry, humanoid guards. And they were all busy with their own tasks.\nThere was only one exception to the two species in the Watch barracks, and that was him. Klbkch. Relc cast an irritable eye over at the large, hunched insect hovering over a table next to him. Klbkch was industriously writing in a large ledger, pausing every few moments to dip his quill into a pot of ink.\n“Are you done logging out for the day yet?”\n“Almost.”\nKlbkch made a precise notation with a quill on a sheet of parchment. He glanced up, and his dry voice was devoid of exasperation by most standards, but Relc could tell his partner was annoyed. It was the subtle clues, like the way Klbkch stared at him with two arms crossed.\nA lot of the new [Guards] couldn’t tell anything about Klbkch—not that they got near him. He was Antinium, and even if he was Senior Guardsman Klbkch, everyone knew who he was and what he represented. But then—this was Liscor, not the army or another city.\nLiscor was unique, so you actually had a guardsman duo of Relc and Klbkch. The Antinium clicked his mandibles, and his voice was annoyed.\n“There. I have signed us both out. Again.”\n“Great. Thanks. Now, wanna go check on that Human? I hear—”\nA female Drake shouted at Relc from across the room. She was nowhere as large as Relc, and she wore chainmail and a sword at her hip as she stomped up to him.\n“Senior Guardsman Relc, belay that! There’s a brawl in the marketplace. Get over there and stop the fighting!”\nHe sat up and\ngroaned.\nKlbkch turned as the Drake pointed. She had light blue scales, almost cobalt, and bright yellow eyes. She also had her badge of office pinned to her chest and—whenever she was talking to Relc—a vexed glare. Right now, the vexation was for the idiots fighting. Relc protested.\n“What? Some idiot had to start a fight\nnow\nof all times? We were going to go back and—”\n“Shut up and get moving! I need everyone there, now.”\n“But—we’re signed out—”\n“\nWe’ll count your hours later, move!\n”\nThe Drake strode off, already snapping at another patrol who rushed for the door. Relc stayed where he was for a moment, mouth open in protest. Then he swung himself to his feet.\n“…Jerk.”\nKlbkch was already signing them back in and checking his gear. He sighed but nodded to Relc. Despite his grumblings, the [Spearmaster] was on his feet fast.\n“A pity. Let’s be on our way.”\nThey headed for the door, and the rest of the [Guards] called for the brawl fell in behind them. They had clubs, truncheons, and shields; neither Relc nor Klbkch went for their spear and swords. Relc made one huge fist and glared at the female Drake in disgust.\n“What a pain. Let’s smack some scales-for-brains quick. Maybe we’ll still have time to go to the inn afterwards.”\nKlbkch shook his head slowly. He was calculating and reminded Relc of the obvious.\n“You know we will be called upon to go after those who got away. And there is damage assessment, guard detail, investigating any burglaries during the violence…”\n“Aw.”\n“Do not fret. The Human will not be going anywhere.”\n“I know, I know. But I was going to eat more pasta and—”\n“\nRelc!\n”\nThe angry shout made Relc wince and cover the two holes on the side of his head. The female Drake was pointing as she headed back for the second floor.\n“Alright, let’s go. Man, I really hate Captain Z.”\nThat was his name for her. Klbkch looked reprovingly at Relc as they marched out the doors.\n“Don’t insult the Watch Captain while we are within earshot.”\n“She can eat my scales. Let’s go and get this over with.”\n“After you.”\nThey sighed as they got back to work. Relc sighed even louder because his stomach was grumbling and he’d promised it pasta. Late shifts and overtime pay, which was nice. But for what? He’d have to grab a snack at midnight, not a proper meal, and visit the inn tomorrow. It was okay for Klbkch; he had no life. But Relc?\nHe just hoped the [Innkeeper] wouldn’t stay up waiting for him.",

    "text": "Erin sat at the bar counter in the inn and waited. All was perfect.\nWell, all was sorta perfect. It was at least acceptable. She had a basket of the blue fruits, more pasta in a large pot, and she’d even drawn a fresh bucket of water from the stream. She had very nearly spotless plates and silverware, and, all in all, she was ready for some guests.\nIf they’d ever arrive. At first, Erin kept checking the door every few minutes, even going to the window to see if she could spot them. But then she found herself leaning back in her chair, waiting—it had been a long day of walking back and forth on top of being sick. She supposed she was still recovering, because she was very, very tired. She wasn’t\nthat\nhungry, but she wanted to wait for Relc and Klbkch.\nEventually, Erin’s eyes drooped. Her breathing slowed. She fell asleep while dreaming she was still waiting and awake. She was counting blue fruits with the little Goblin when—\nThump. Thump.\nErin woke up with a start. She raised her head and looked around groggily. It was dark. The inn had gone from faint light to no light in what felt like a heartbeat. The set table was almost shrouded as she sat up.\nThey never came. Or wait—\nwhat was this?\nThump. Thump\n.\nSomething was at the door. The pounding was low and steady. Erin wiped the drool off of her chin and got up from the table. She must have fallen asleep waiting. But here they were. She stumbled over to the door and shivered.\nOdd. The nights were somewhat chilly, but right now it was actually cold. Actually, it wasn’t just cold. It was…\nfrosty?\nThe door’s handle was covered in a thin layer of ice. From behind the door, Erin sensed something chilling, and she could feel a cold draft blowing from beneath the crack. Or was that the shivering sensation running down her spine?\nThump.\nErin jumped back from the door. That wasn’t knocking. Something was hitting the door. Hard.\n“Hey. Who’s there?”\nShe wished her voice wasn’t so wobbly.\n“A visitor.”\nWas it a whisper? No. It was more like an echo. It sounded like a loud voice coming from thousands of miles away, and it had an unearthly quality to it. No voice could be so deep, so spine-chilling.\n“Um. We’re closed. S-sorry.”\nThe something on the other side of the door…chuckled. It was probably a chuckle. It was wet and gurgling.\n“It matters not. I require sustenance. Food. Provide that to me, and I shall be on my way.”\nFood?\nAs in the fleshy variety? Erin shuddered.\n“I don’t have any. Go away!”\n“I will not be denied. Open this door or face my wrath.”\nThat was enough for Erin. She backed away from the door.\n“I’m warning you! Come in and I’ll, I’ll…”\nShe looked around desperately. It was too dark, and she’d forgotten where she’d put the Goblins’ knives. Weapon. She needed a weapon.\n“Do not anger me further. If you refuse my simple request, I will—”\nShe didn’t wait to see what the voice would do. She could guess. Instead, Erin ran to the kitchen. She needed a weapon. A knife, a piece of wood, a spatula,\nanything.\nErin’s hand had found the handle of a pot when the scrape of wood made her breath stop. She’d forgotten. She’d been waiting for Klbkch and his friend. So that meant—\nThe door was still unlocked.\nSomething\nwas pushing the door open. Erin sprinted back to the door and threw her weight against it. She knocked back whatever it was, but she couldn’t close the door fully. It was in the way.\n“This is unwise. Your insolence will only bring about more punishment.”\nThe creature hissed at Erin. She could hear it right outside the door. It was pushing, trying to get the door open. But Erin was fueled by pure fear, and she somehow managed to keep the door where it was.\n“Mistress. All I ask for is a bit of food. Provide me that and I shall be on my way.”\nThe skeletal creature reached its hand through the doorway. Something dark dripped down out of its bones. It splashed against the wood and vanished. Its face was—\nthat wasn’t a Human’s skeleton.\nIt was a mask of elongated bone, as long as Erin’s torso. Two jagged nostrils revealed something wet and fleshy, moving in time to the voice behind the bone.\n“I do not wish to become angry.”\nHer hand was on the cooking pot. Her heart was dead in her chest.\n“No.”\n“No?”\nThe skeletal monstrosity seemed to recoil. It pushed the door further open, and something noxious wafted in. It smelled like decay, like worms rotting in an unmarked grave. The monster pushed harder, and Erin’s feet slipped.\n“A pity. But I will have you provide me with sustenance nevertheless.”\nErin seized the door and tried to close it, but the creature hurled it open. She fell back and stared in horror.\nA\nthing\nwith too many bones and pieces of flesh gazed down at her. It gave off a ghastly smell, and crimson light flashed from its eyes. A rotting monstrosity garbed in bone. A dead being of some eldritch horror whose ‘arm’ jerked and twitched as it wriggled towards her, brown rot and decay and mildewed skin.\n“Give me what I desire. Or I shall—”\nErin screamed and hurled the pot.\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

Either way, the bucket of water woke him up.\n“What—who dares—?”\nThe young man sat up, rubbing his head. Erin stared at him. He didn’t seem very mage-like. Or that impressive, for that matter. He had pale skin, brown, unkempt hair, all unwashed and fairly filthy. His fluttering eyes were grey-green, but when they focused, they were sharp as they flickered around and then looked up at her.\nHe actually didn’t look that bad, although he certainly looked thinner than strictly necessary. What was most off-putting was his smell. A rancid odor that contrived to combine personal body odor with a foul sewer stench. Actually, that smell was probably his clothes, which didn’t look like they’d been washed. Ever.\nThe mage stared up at Erin and blinked. She stared back.\n“So. You’re gonna hurt me if I don’t give you food, huh?”\nErin stood up and cracked her knuckles. It really hurt, but she tried not to let it show. The young man raised one finger and pointed at her. It was only slightly trembling.\n“You struck me?\nMe?\nHow dare you! I will have you know I am a mage of great power, and I will not be—”\nThe mage cut off quickly as Erin lifted the cast-iron pot up with one hand.\n“This. This is a pan.”\nErin waved the metal pot in front of the young man’s head. She saw him glance at it and then colored when she realized her mistake.\n“In fact, good Mistress, that is in point of reality—”\n“If I say it’s a pan, it’s a pan. The important part is that I’ll hit you with it if you try anything.”\n“Oh really?”\nThe mage sneered at her. Erin took offense to his tone instantly. His voice sounded sort of educated, precisely enunciating each word, but it was acerbic. Sneering was the default mode to his voice. The young man’s gaze darted about, first to Erin, then around. He eyed her pot, but then he lifted one hand. Erin recoiled as the young man’s gaze seemed to brighten. She felt something change and panicked.\n“Hey, stop that!”\nHe ignored her and mumbled something. At once, he vanished. He was gone! A booming echo reverberated throughout the room, wrathful.\n“\nBehold my p—\n”\nErin swung her pot in the space where the mage had vanished.\nClong.\n“Ow!”\nThe mage reappeared, clutching at the side of his face. Erin raised her pot again, and he raised his hands defensively.\n“Try that again and I’ll hit you harder.”\nHe shielded his face, backing up, but he stumbled on his robe and nearly fell down. He was most likely dazed from two blows to the head, so he raised his hands and sniffed loudly. Despite his situation, he adopted a lecturing, superior tone as he lifted a finger.\n“Now look here, there’s no need for violence, Miss. I can see that you are no ordinary plebian fool but an\nextraordinary\nplebian. Believe me when I say that is a high compliment from a practitioner of the arcane such as I.”\nErin glared.\n“I know what plebian means.”\nHis mouth opened, and the young man’s supercilious expression turned to worry.\n“Ah.”\n“One more insult or stupid little invisibility spell and I’ll break something.”\nThe mage looked surprised.\n“You—you could tell it was an invisibility spell?”\nErin rolled her eyes.\n“What else could it be? I’ve played D&D.”\nThe mage blinked at her. Then he muttered to himself in a not-quite whisper.\n“How astute. She’s quite intelligent for an [Innkeeper].”\nErin glared. He coughed and avoided her gaze.\n“Ahem. Well, I shall be going. I am—terribly sorry for all that. It was just, ah—a spell which I—desperate times make fools of us all. And clearly, not you. Which is why I shall depart and not trouble you again.”\nHe made a show of standing up and brushing down his robes. Quite a lot of dirt and grime fell to the inn’s floor. Erin stared at it and glared at him harder. He swept her a deep bow and gave her a charming smile. Or what he probably thought was one. The young man reached into his robes, and she lifted the pot, but he held up his other hand hurriedly.\n“My apologies, good [Innkeeper], for all these misunderstandings. Please accept this recompense for your wasted time.”\nHe reached into the pocket of his robes and produced a few bronze coins. He made to offer them to Erin, but when she made no move, he placed them on the table.\n“So. You’re paying me for trying to scare me and steal food?”\nThe mage gave her a winning smile. It did nothing to wipe away Erin’s scowl.\n“Harshly put, good Mistress. But yes, I would like to make amends. Let us be quits with no further unpleasantness! Or violence. And I am sure this payment is quite acceptable, is it not?”\nErin stared at the four bronze circles, which he grandly placed next to the bronze coins. She glanced up at his face. He looked entirely reasonable, even apologetic.\nHer\nface was impassive and betrayed no emotion whatsoever.\n“You’re sweating.”\nHe began dabbing at his forehead with his robe.\n“Am I? Terribly sorry. Let me just, ah…”\nThree more coins appeared in the palm of his hand with a flick of the wrist. It looked like a sleight-of-hand trick. A pretty bad one, at that. Erin stared at the seven coins. Not one was silver. Hadn’t Relc given her two silver coins for a meal? She changed her grip on her pot for more striking power.\n“Some people don’t like being threatened by a giant skeletal monster from hell.”\n“I-I see?”\nThe number of coins on the table didn’t change. Erin stared at him.\n“Some people would take\nviolent\noffense to being scammed.”\nThe young man blinked once.\n“Ah, this is understandable. But may I remind you that traditionally those who practice magic are beings of great power that should not be crossed?”\nErin wanted to fold her arms, but she kept the pot raised.\n“Yeah, and they have fragile bones. I’m sure mages are really scary when they’re far away, but wands aren’t good at blocking frying…pots.”\nThe mage licked his lips, but his face remained calm.\n“Fair point. Let me just amend my fee.”\nA silver coin appeared in the palm of his hand. Erin narrowed her eyes and said nothing. Another silver coin appeared, and then a third.\nShe crossed her arms.\nThree more silver coins joined the small pile. The mage was definitely sweating now.\n“I, uh, hope this is sufficient, good Mistress. I am of course willing to pay any dues to—to make amends, but I’m slightly low on coin at the moment.”\nErin kept staring.\nVery reluctantly, he reached into the belt at his side. He pulled out a gold coin and held it up.\n“Would, ah,\nthis\ndo?”\nErin relented a tiny bit. She picked up the coins in his hand without taking the gold coin. She thought she heard him sigh in relief, but his face remained impassive. He was still sweating. She eyed him and nodded to the table.\n“You know, I just wanted to see what would happen if I kept on staring at you.”\nHe tried to hide it, but his eyes widened a moment in what might have been shock or outrage. The young man sniffed and then coughed into one sleeve.\n“Ah. Of course. Well, as a practitioner of the mystic arts, I feel it is always wise to be…generous.”\nErin’s face told him how much she believed that. She frowned at the coins she’d taken.\n“It would certainly save time. And you know if you paid for everything, you wouldn’t have to try to scare people to get what you want.”\nAnother sniff, as if she were speaking nonsense. He flicked his fingers dismissively.\n“Ah, but money is so…mundane. Where would the enjoyment in life be without variety?”\n“Uh huh. And you provide that by threatening people with illusions?”\n“Only on occasion. And I quite understand your irate feelings. However, since I believe all is settled, I shall just…”\nHe edged away from her and towards the door. Along the way, his stomach rumbled and his ears turned red, but he kept walking. Erin sighed and came to a rapid decision.\n“Where are you going?”\nHis shoulders hunched, and Erin saw his hand tighten on the door handle.\n“Well, if you have no further need of me…I\ndid\npay for my misdeeds, after all. Rather handsomely, I might add, given that no harm was actually done except to my person. So I won’t intrude any fu—”\n“Come back here and I’ll feed you.”\nHe turned around and blinked at her. Erin was already going into the kitchen for a plate and cups.\n“Here. Blue juice and some blue fruit. I’ve also got pasta, but I need to warm that up first.”\nErin set the cup and plate down and added three blue fruits on top of it. She expected the mage to dig in immediately or make a snarky comment, but he just turned pale.\n“Ah. Am I supposed to eat this?”\n“Yeah. It’s food.”\n“And I suppose if I don’t, you hit me with that pot, correct?”\nHe eyed her warily. Erin eyed him back.\n“\nWhat\nare you talking about? I’m giving you food. Are you allergic to the color blue or something?”\nOnce again, the face of her guest seemed caught between wanting to say something and wanting to bolt. He pointed gingerly to the blue fruit.\n“Are you aware that, ah, this fruit is poisonous?”\nErin paused, the blue fruit halfway to her lips.\n“Poisonous?”\nHe smiled at her, his face a shade paler than before.\n“Highly. The core of the Amentus Fruit causes painful death within hours if eaten. While the outer rind is safe for consumption, the inner seeds are toxic. You are aware of this, right?”\n“Um. I am now? I mean, I figured that out earlier. These ones are good. I’ve checked them.”\nThe look he gave her said that he didn’t believe her. The look\nshe\ngave\nhim\ntold him that he could eat her food and she didn’t really care if he was poisoned or not. He gulped.\n“I see.”\n“…Want one?”\nThe mage eyed the blue fruit apprehensively.\n“Do I have the option to refuse?”\nErin sighed.\n“Look, it’s safe. I’ve eaten tons of them. Just eat around the core and you’ll be fine, okay? I figured out how to check for good ones. See?”\nHis was very ripe, non-mushy, and when Erin took a bite to show him, she was sure it wasn’t contaminated. Still, her odd guest made no move towards the plate. He steepled his fingers and gave her a genuinely fake smile.\n“Shall we just say I accept your word? I wouldn’t dare question your authority on the subject, good Mistress, it’s just that—”\n“Oh come\non.\n”\nErin stomped into the kitchen and grabbed a knife. The mage flinched when she reappeared with it, but she grabbed one of the fruits and began cutting the outer shell of fruit away. She left the seed core on the counter and shoved the diced fruit into a plate. Two more fruits went the same way before she\nplonked\nthe plate down in front of him.\nThe seed cores were perfectly intact, too. Whereas the bad ones she’d found had shown hairline cracks when she’d explored the insides. That little Goblin was on to something.\n“Here. Totally non-poisonous food ready to be eaten. Happy?”\nShe glared at him. He gingerly picked up a slice of blue fruit and regarded it apprehensively. He looked ready to refuse, but then both he and Erin heard a loud sound.\nIt was a growling beast that almost made Erin look for a monster—until she realized it was his stomach. The young man turned beet red, and Erin almost laughed at him. He hesitated, then the fresh food in front of him seemed to do in his last resolve.\n“I suppose the toxicity would be acceptable if it were just the fruit. Well then.”\nGingerly, he bit into the fruit and chewed. After a few seconds, he swallowed and took another bite. His eyes widened, and he began chewing vigorously.\nIn under a minute, the plate was empty and he was wiping the blue dribbles off his mouth with a corner of his robe.\nErin set down a plate of steaming pasta in front of him.\n“You’re hungry, aren’t you? Well, eat this.”\n“My thanks.”\nAnd it even sounded like genuine thanks. Erin guessed he had been fairly hungry. Actually, now that she looked closer, his robes did seem to hang rather thin on his frame. And if you factored in the dirtiness and general smell he was now giving off, she guessed he was in pretty rough shape.\nStill, he ate with all the vigor and energy of two men, so she supposed he was still okay. And once she’d refilled his plate, he slowed down. After a while, he stopped, probably to let his stomach expand, and regarded her.\n“So, if I might inquire, what is a delicate flower of effervescence doing in such a locale?”\nErin glared at him.\n“Are you\ntrying\nto sound impressive or do you actually talk like that?”\nHe drew himself upright and looked indignant.\n“How rude. My advanced lexicon and diction is merely a result of my education, not a façade that—”\n“Stop it. You sound like an idiot.”\nHis eyes narrowed, but Erin’s glare out-glared his own. He snapped back testily.\n“Fine. I suppose there’s no use attempting to impress anyone who actually has the rudiments of an education. But my question remains: what’s a young g—\nwoman\nlike you doing out here alone?”\nHis voice was no less haughty and condescending than before, but at least he wasn’t dropping seven-letter word scores every other sentence. Erin decided that was worth a few more seconds of forbearance. That didn’t mean she had to be polite, though.\n“I got lost.”\nHe raised an eyebrow.\n“Lost? It takes quite some skill to wander this far into the Floodplains. Or are you a local? I very much doubt you are, though.”\n“Floodplains? What are you talking about?”\nThe mage waved a hand around lazily.\n“This area is known as the Floodplains of Liscor. It’s because of a lovely natural phenomenon of the geography and—but you aren’t from here, if you don’t know about this area. But I would have guessed as much since you are Human. As far as I can tell.”\n“I am completely, 100% Human, thanks. And why does that make a difference?”\n“The locals don’t like Humans that much. Which is a fact anyone in a hundred miles would know. This is the border to the Drake lands to the south. But you…didn’t know that, did you?”\nHe gulped down a few more noodles while watching her. Erin’s mouth opened, and he frowned at her.\n“You truly didn’t? Well, well. A traveller who doesn’t know anything about where she is…teleportation spell? Amnesia magic?”\nErin blinked at him.\n“How’d you guess? Actually, you’re only half-right, but how’d you guess?”\nHe shrugged.\n“It’s common. Well, not common exactly, but it’s the only explanation I can think of. Back in the Academy…it was not an unheard of phenomenon. I suppose you could have also been carried off by one of the local avian species, but they tend to drop their prey and chew their bones.”\nErin shuddered.\n“They grow that big? No; don’t tell me. I don’t want to know. But you’re right. It was a teleportation spell. Or something. It didn’t feel like a spell, but…”\n“And you’re an expert on [Teleportation] spells? I see.”\nThis time, the sneer in his tone was a bit too pronounced. Erin’s hand twitched towards the pot.\n“I’m not. But I’ll just bet those kinds of spells make a flash of light or a weird sound, right?”\nHe looked reluctant.\n“…Perhaps.”\n“And anyways, I didn’t see any idiot in robes waving a wand around and shouting ‘abracadabra’. And there aren’t wizards where I—I mean, I’m sure it wasn’t a…I just turned the corner and here I was.”\nErin trailed off, but the mage’s eyes were suddenly filled with interest. He leaned forwards in his chair.\n“Really? You just turned a corner and you were in a completely different place?”\n“Yeah. It’s been fun and games ever since.”\nHe sat back.\n“Fascinating. That has to be a very high-level phenomenon or artifact. Seamless teleportation without any visual cues and even sensation at that range? Not even our Archmages could…fascinating\nindeed.\n”\n“Fascinating as in ‘I know what spell that was?’”\nThe mage caught himself and looked up. He hesitated, then shook his head.\n“No, no. I have no clue what kind of magic would be capable of that, if any. That sounds like a spell which—well, suffice it to say I know of only a few living mages who might even\nattempt\nsuch a feat. But if you were the target, it still makes no sense. Why would anyone waste such a powerful spell on someone as mundane as…as…”\n“Me?”",

    "text": "He avoided her gaze and wiped his mouth on his sleeve, which arguably made his mouth dirtier.\n“Yes, well. I see you’ve established yourself quite nicely. This is—is quite a lovely establishment you’ve founded. Very quaint.”\n“It’s not mine. I just found it and somehow became an [Innkeeper] by cleaning up around here.”\n“Indeed. That is quite often the case. However, you seem to have taken to it well. This area is inhospitable to most Humans.”\n“Thanks, I guess. But if it’s so lousy—and it is, I totally know—why are\nyou\nhere?”\nHe blinked at her.\n“Me?”\n“Yes, you. I told you why I’m here. What’s a raggedy mage doing scaring people for food?”\nHe swept his robes around himself defensively.\n“My physical appearance has nothing to do with—”\n“Just answer the question.”\nHe looked uncomfortable.\n“I, ah, came here to expand my horizons. This part of the continent—well, the local collection of city-states are quite hospitable to those people trying to avoid undue attention. Besides, food is plentiful if one has certain skills.”\n“Like pretending to be a horrible monster?”\nThe young man was having a real problem looking anywhere near Erin. He flushed slightly and twiddled his thumbs together, then cleaned his plate with a fork.\n“One does what one must to survive.”\nShe looked at him.\n“I suppose one does. Does it make you feel good, stealing from innocent people?”\nHer words turned his face bright red. He set down his fork and pushed his empty plate back. The mage looked up at Erin, and his eyes focused with sudden anger.\n“You would not be so quick to judge if you knew more about the people you’re defending. Especially\nthis\ncity.”\nThe young woman hesitated only a second, but then put her hands on her hips.\n“Maybe not. But then again, the only two I’ve met were quite polite, paid for their meal, and didn’t try to threaten me when I first met them. Whereas the first Human I met was you.”\nAgain, Erin and her guest locked eyes. This time, he broke away first. He got to his feet with a swirl of his robes.\n“I see I’ve overstayed my welcome. Well, your meal was quite adequate, good Mistress. Please accept my heartfelt gratitude.”\nHe probably meant to stalk away, but Erin barred his path.\n“Here.”\nShe offered him two blue fruits. He hesitated.\n“Take them. You look thin, and maybe if you eat them you’ll stop bothering other people. Thank you for your business. Come by again and I’ll feed you. Try to scare me and I’ll hit you harder next time.”\nHe blinked at her, but accepted the fruits anyways.\n“Um. Thank you.”\nThey stood there awkwardly for a moment.\n“It occurs to me that I never asked your name.”\n“Me? Oh, I’m Erin. Erin Solstice. And you are?”\nThe mage took a step back and gave her an elegant bow. Erin stared at the blue stain on the sleeve of his robe.\n“Pisces, practitioner of magic, student of Wistram Academy, specialized in the Elementalist and Illusionary schools of magic with additional competencies in multiple spell schools.”\nErin raised an eyebrow.\n“Good for you. Got a hobby?”\nHe hesitated and put one hand on the doorknob. The mage gave Erin a long look and murmured.\n“…Necromancy.”\nHe closed the door as Erin stared.\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "At some point, Erin slept. At some point, Erin woke up. These were minor details. What mattered was the sound.\nKnock. Knock\n.\nShe tried hard to ignore it. But it kept going and going, waking her up from her peaceful oblivion.\nAfter a while, the knocking was too much to ignore. Erin opened her eyes and sat up. It was far too bright in the world. And noisy.\nSomeone was knocking at the front door. The\nlocked\nfront door. Erin thought about going back to sleep, but the knocking hadn’t ceased for the last few minutes. It was the kind of knocking that said the person on the other side knew there was someone to bother, and they would develop the cadence and volume to be annoying if they did this for an hour straight. So, at last, Erin reluctantly got up and opened the door.\nShe greeted the knocker with the world’s hugest scowl, like she would her mother waking her up early after a late-night study session.\n“What do you want?”\nPisces the friendly mage gave her a brilliant smile.\n“Greetings, good Mistress. I was wondering if I could impose upon you—”\nErin shut the door. After a few seconds, she opened it.\n“Fewer words. Get to the point.”\nThe [Necromancer] looked haughty—but then caught himself as an audible little growl escaped his stomach. He coughed delicately into one sleeve.\n“Um. Very well. Are you open today?”\nThe [Innkeeper] actually turned around blankly.\n“Who?”\n“You. This establishment.”\n“Here?”\nPisces blinked a few times. He spoke very carefully, pointing at the ground and enunciating each word clearly.\n“Is this place open? Do you provide sustenan—food? I pay, I eat?”\nErin finally caught on and glared blearily at him. She thrust the door open further.\n“It’s early. Yes, I guess I am open. Come in.”\nShe stomped inside. After a moment, Pisces followed.\n“I would like to peruse your menu if I m—”\nErin’s glower cut him off. She came back with four blue fruits and tossed them on the table. Pisces stared at the fruit and opened his mouth. He looked at Erin’s expression and amended whatever he was going to say.\n“If I might trouble you for a knife and fork—”\nShe slapped them down on the table and walked away.\n“And a plate?”\nErin’s service came with a huge frown. But he did get the plate. She would have liked to go back to sleep, but the sounds of Pisces shifting and the\nclink\nof silverware on pottery was too distracting. Instead, she got her own blue fruit and started a fire to warm up her pasta. She munched on the sweet fruit in dour silence.\nOutside, it began to rain.",

    "text": "Rain. Rain fell down from the heavens like hail. Well, actually it fell like rain, but these were bigger drops that fell a lot faster and harder than normal. The hammering of rain against the rooftop was nearly deafening.\nNearly. Behind her, Pisces set down his knife and fork and sighed loudly. Erin wished he weren’t here. It wasn’t that she disliked company; she was starved for it. She just wished her company wasn’t him.\n“That’s a lot of rain.”\nShe was talking to herself, but he seemed to take it as an invitation to speak.\n“It happens quite often. A natural weather phenomenon, you know.”\nErin turned and glared at Pisces. He raised both eyebrows and held up his cup.\n“Another drink if you would. My cup has run dry.”\n“Where did you find—stay out of my kitchen.”\n“I would be only too happy to. But I fear I was quite parched, and if you would be so good…?”\nErin’s eye twitched. But she went and got a cup for herself as well. She didn’t pour his drink, but rather set the pitcher of juice on the other end of the table so he had to reach for it. She glanced out the window and saw, well, nothing.\nEven the darn mountains had been obscured by the kind of rainfall that made you hope your gutters were clear back home. Erin could barely see ten feet into the downpour. She shivered; that kind of onslaught was one thing in her home or indoors, but this inn felt a bit too—fragile. Pisces, for himself, seemed quite glad he was here, not anywhere else. Erin turned to him and gestured outside.\n“Does it rain like this a lot?”\nHe took his time replying, and when he did, his voice was distinctly self-satisfied, lecturing. Almost like a pompous college professor—not that Erin had ever gone to any classes, just been accepted.\n“Seldom. It is a seasonal weather pattern to rain like this in the spring. Fall downpours like these are an aberration. Normally, I would not hazard a guess at how long the rain would fall, but someone has been interfering with the weather. So we’ll have a brief storm, that’s all. Hardly anything as memorable as magical rain.”\nThat statement was loaded. Erin took the bait because she had to.\n“Interfering with the weather? How? And what do you mean—\nmagical\nrain? Like what?”\nHe smirked at her. She noted with displeasure that he was already on his second cup of blue juice.\n“With magic, how else? Some shortsighted fool must have cast a localized weather control spell. Impressive, I suppose, but clumsy in execution. As for magical rain—have you never observed glowing rain in any color? Magical typhoons? Ah…raining toads?”\nErin glanced back at the furious downpour—it did indeed seem to be lessening already.\n“Raining\ntoads?\nDoesn’t that only happen when a tornado picks them up?”\nPisces hesitated. Erin turned back just in time to see his look of surprise covered by an attempt at banal amusement. He made a show of taking a sip from his cup.\n“Ahem. Of course, that is how the phenomenon actually occurs. But the impetus is largely magical…I see you know your way around some natural events. This particular storm will not be raining any creatures, however. It truly was someone simply sending unwanted rain our way. It may be a scandal, although given how the Drake cities squabble—I detected it from the south. Perhaps as far as Pallass.”\nErin had no idea what Pallass was, but other cities of Drakes? She leaned too-casually on the table, now giving Pisces her full attention.\n“Wow, that’s far, right? Wouldn’t you have to be a pretty powerful sorcerer to do that?”\n“The term is mage, good Mistress.”\n“The name is Erin, idiot.”\nHe smirked, already cocky again.\n“Aha. Accept my apologies. But if you are referring to one of my exalted brethren, mage is the best term to use.”\nErin stared at him. He didn’t appear abashed in any way.\n“You don’t have wizards or sorcerers or…warlocks? Witches? You’re all just mages?”\nPisces flicked his fingers haughtily, then decided to wipe them on his robes instead.\n“I did not say specialization is absent from the magical world. Rather, shall we say that those are titles for mages who meet certain requirements? A [Wizard] is an arcane researcher and true student of the arcane arts. Such individuals are similar to myself, but prefer to study the mainstream branches of magic. [Sorcerers], on the other hand, are quite simplistic and refer to those who use no spellbooks and have little formal education. [Warlocks] obtain their powers from other sources such as summoning, while [Witches] practice alchemy along with specialized schools of magic. Their…very\npeculiar\nmagic, which is so rooted in folklore. Nevertheless, [Mage] remains the generally accepted title to refer to all those who practice magic as a catchall moniker…”\nHe trailed off. Erin was staring at him. Pisces gave her a confident smirk. She raised her eyebrows.\n“Okay. So you’re saying [Mage] means anyone who uses magic. Next time, just say that.”\nHis face visibly fell. Pisces moodily stabbed at a piece of blue fruit.\n“You asked. I was merely fulfilling my role as a guest.”\n“Good. For you. So what, a—mage did this?”\nHe shrugged.\n“Yes. And it’s not as if this is a particularly difficult task. I realize it may look so to the uninitiated, but a spell like this could easily be cast by a level 30 [Mage]. Less, I suppose, if the individual were specialized.”\n“So…?”\n“As I said, not that impressive. Many mages could cast a spell like this.”\n“Can you?”\nPisces paused. He chewed slowly, looking past Erin.\n“My specialization lies in other areas.”\n“Like dead bodies.”\nThe young man’s jaw tensed ever-so-slightly. Erin saw his thin frame—and he was thin and hungry, judging by how fast he’d eaten her blue fruits—shift in his chair. Pisces glanced at the door and avoided Erin’s gaze and drained his cup.\n“Merely another branch of magic, good Mistress Erin. I note you don’t have the same aversion as a less-informed fool. Let me assure you—”\nErin stared at him. She opened her mouth, but then the door slammed open. Both Erin and Pisces turned as a wet, dark figure sauntered into the inn and threw his arms wide.\n“Good morning everyone! Weird Ant behind me, friendly Human, and—oh.”\nRelc strode into the inn, beaming, then visibly did a double-take when he saw Pisces. The [Necromancer] jerked in his seat, then froze. Klbkch closed the door and bowed slightly at Erin.\n“Please pardon our intrusion. Is this establishment open for business?”\n“What? Oh. Yeah.”\nErin scrambled for words. Relc was still staring at Pisces, who studiously ignored him as he refilled his cup. She smiled at Relc, glancing at Pisces.\n“Hey, you two! Klb—Klbk? It’s been a while. I guess. But come in. Or come in more. Have a seat. Want something to eat?”\n“If you would be so kind. Thank you, Miss Erin. It is\nKlbkch\n, but you may refer to me as Senior Guardsman if that is simpler.”\nKlbkch wiped his feet and stepped over to a table. Relc was still staring. He frowned at Pisces then jabbed a claw his way before eying Erin suspiciously.\n“You multiplied. Can Humans do that?”\n“What? Oh no, that’s just Pisces. He’s annoying, so ignore him.”\nErin waved Relc over to a seat as she went to the kitchen for plates. Relc kept staring until Klbkch kicked him and motioned him to a seat.\n“I believe staring is considered rude in most cultures. Sit down and cease your rudeness.”\nRelc glared and sat, rubbing his leg. Klbkch turned and nodded to Pisces.\n“Please excuse my companion’s lack of tact.”\nPisces waved his fork airily, but Erin, poking her head out of the kitchen, realized the young man was no longer smiling. He had pushed his chair back from the table, and he kept glancing her way. It didn’t stop his mouth from running, though.\n“I paid no attention. The plebian masses are a burden to be endured; I bear no ill will to the misinformed or ignorant for their rudeness.”\nKlbkch and Relc exchanged a glance.\n“Indeed. It has been nice to make your acquaintance.”\n“\nHumans.\nThey’re so—”\nErin reemerged from the kitchen, trying to hold a pot of hot noodles and several plates with only two hands. She interrupted the two.\n“Do you guys want pasta or blue fruit?”\nRelc broke off, coughing.\n“Ah. Eh. Um, what I meant was—”\nKlbkch raised one hand politely as he kicked Relc subtly again.\n“I would be delighted to try the blue fruit. I believe my tongue-tied partner would like some as well.”\n“Right. Food. I’ll have some.”\nPisces waved his fork again.\n“And me. A second plate and a refill of my drink, if you would.”\nThere was something so presumptuous about his tone that Erin scowled. She slowly walked into the kitchen, put the pot back down, and then came out. She jabbed a thumb over her shoulder.\n“You want pasta? It’s in the kitchen. Get it yourself.”\nPisces’ outraged\nsniff\nat the discrepancy in service was ignored. Turning her back on him, Erin smiled at Relc and Klbkch.\n“So, um, hi again. It’s been a while. Klb…Klbkch and…?”\nKlbkch nodded while Relc looked expectant.\n“Um. Uh…”\n“Relc.”\nKlbkch murmured softly. Erin beamed desperately.\n“Relc! Right, right.”\n“What? How come you remembered this idiot’s name and not mine?”\nRelc looked aggrieved. Erin blushed.\n“Um, sorry.”\nThe Drake leaned over the table, frowning. He looked bigger today, or perhaps it was being able to contrast him with Pisces. Relc was over six feet tall without the long neck spines that ran from the back of his head like a thin mohawk. He was also, Erin realized, wearing all-leather armor, and today, he’d leaned his spear against the table.\nHe even had a shortsword at his side and a dagger and a belt with two glowing bottles and a few pouches.\nBelt pouches seemed like a style in this world, because Pisces had them—and so did Klbkch. Although—Erin noticed now—the Antinium had two\nswords\nsheathed at his waist. And two daggers.\nWow, they were armed.\nWas this the level of police in this world? Then again—if that was the case, Erin supposed they were just regularly armed. But it might be why Pisces kept glancing at them. He had no weapons, she noted, just a stick at his side.\nWait, was that a wand?\nErin turned and stared at it, but Relc tapped the table, interrupting her train of thought.\n“Aren’t I the better-looking one here? What gives?”\nErin turned and gave him an embarrassed smile.\n“Sorry. It’s just—uh, you know. I’ve got a bad memory.”\n“Really?”\n“…No. Sorry. It’s just been a busy two days.”\n“Oh.”\nHe looked deflated. Erin tried to cheer him up.\n“Relc! I’ve got the name, now. And I’ve got more pasta. Well, it’s old pasta, but it still tastes good! And more blue juice. And blue fruit! It’s, uh, not poisonous if you only eat the outer bit.”\n“Ooh, pasta!”\nRelc perked up instantly. Erin went to fetch the pasta and placed two steaming plates in front of the two.\n“My thanks.”\nKlbkch nodded at Erin, and both began eating. Around mouthfuls, Relc eyed Erin and then Pisces.\n“So, how’re you doing? Level up again?”\n“Actually, I did. Right after you two left.”\n“Ooh, congratulations! Did you get a new skill?”\n“[Basic Crafting]. It helped me make a basket out of grass.”\nHe chuckled knowingly.\n“That’s quite useful! Most craftsman and artisan classes get that early on. I guess [Innkeepers] are sorta like that, right? Got to take care of the inn, repair windows, fix tables, and all that.”\n“I guess. I haven’t ever tried that, and besides, I don’t have a hammer. Actually, I’ve never swung a hammer in my life.”\n“Well, you’ve got the Skill for it, so it’ll be a breeze. And you can buy a hammer no problem. Just head down to the city, and you can get a good one for only a silver coin or two. Tell you what, if you’re ever in the area, I’ll help you get one at a discount.”\n“Really? That’s really generous. Thank you.”\nErin smiled hesitatingly at Relc, who grinned back at her as he slurped down a noodle. Klbkch set down his fork and nodded at his companion.\n“Not entirely. I do believe my companion would earn a small fee for directing any business to his associates.”\nRelc glared at Klbkch. He tried to kick him, but the Antinium had scooted his chair back too far. They were both sitting fairly wide of the table, Erin realized. Oddly so.\n“Shut up. Do you\nhave\nto ruin everything I say?”\n“I am merely pointing out the truth.”\n“Well…stop it.”\nErin had to smile as the two began bickering. However, she was the only one amused. Across the inn, Pisces drained his mug and\nplonked\nit down on the table.\n“If we’re done with the lovely chatting, my glass is empty. Isn’t attending to one’s customers part of my service?”\nErin glared. Relc glared too. Klbkch—well, she still couldn’t read the ant man’s expression, but he definitely gave off a silent air of disapproval.\n“Nice customer you’ve got here.”\n“Yeah. Hey—shut up!”\nPisces raised his brows.\n“How discourteous. I believe I shall bring my business elsewhere next time.”\n“I don’t want it anyways. Besides, you tried to rob me last time. You’re here on sufferance because I feel bad for you.”\nHe sighed and rolled his eyes heavenward. Erin sniffed and debated whether she should refill his glass anyways, but felt a sharp poke in her side. She screamed and jumped.\n“Sorry.”\n“Don’t—don’t\ndo\nthat!”\nErin rubbed at where Relc’s claw had poked her. He looked startled at her reaction and actually apologetic.\n“Sorry. Again. But…you said rob? As in, that guy over there tried to rob you?”\nRelc’s voice was a low hissing whisper as he glanced over at Pisces. He needn’t have bothered, though. Pisces was still engrossed in his cup. Erin grinned maliciously and whispered back.\n“Yeah. Last night, I was visited by a scary monster. But when I hit it with a pa—pot, it turned out just to be him. So I got him to pay up for scaring me. That covers all the food he ate, I guess.”\n“The fee was extorted under duress.”\n“Shut up! You’re lucky I didn’t just toss you in the stream and let the fish eat you!”\nKlbkch and Relc exchanged a glance. Relc gave the Antinium a slow nod, and Klbkch returned it. Relc turned a goggle-eyed gaze back to Erin.\n“And…you let him come back for breakfast?”\n“Well, it’s not like he’s dangerous. Just annoying.”\n“And you didn’t think to report him to anyone?”\n“Like who?”\nErin stared blankly at Relc. He stared at her. Klbkch finished his plate of noodles and set down his fork. Then he stared at Erin too. She looked at the [Guardsmen] and slapped her forehead.\n“Oh.\nOh.\nI forgot. And besides, you weren’t here yesterday.”\nKlbkch nodded.\n“Very true. Our absence was most lamentable. But allow us to perform our duty now. Incidentally, Mistress Solstice, the pasta was delicious.”\n“Yeah, it’s great! Hold on.”\nRelc grabbed the fork and started shoveling the pasta in his mouth. He was able to cram nearly half the plate down his throat in one huge gulp and munched down the rest in seconds. Erin stared with fascinated horror and a tiny bit of envy as he gobbled.\nThat done, Relc exchanged a glance with Klbkch. Then he turned to Pisces.\n“Hey, you!”\nPisces looked up with a scowl. He glared at Relc and made an irritable\nharrumph\n.\n“Do you want something? I don’t do magic upon request. If you seek a certain spell, I would be happy to discuss my remunerations…later.”\n“Really?”\nRelc grinned in his seat. He shifted, exposing one huge bicep, as he moved his right arm towards his spear. Erin felt a prickle run down her spine. Wait. What was…was what she thought about to happen? No way. No—\n“How about you do the magic spell where you turn into a monster? I’d\nlove\nto see that. Or better yet, do you have a spell to get out of trouble? Because you’re going to need one now.”\nPisces’ face went blank. His eyes flicked to Erin and then back to Relc and Klbkch. Erin saw his jaw tense, and then he smiled at her. A glassy, empty smile. She felt a pang in her chest, and she didn’t know why. Only that the slightly supercilious look in his gaze had turned to something blankly hostile. No…resigned? As if he had expected…\nThe young man made a show of standing up, dusting off his robes.",

    "text": "“Ah. I see the good [Innkeeper] holds a grudge. Well, I’m not sure what she told you two, but I assure you, I have compensated her more than adequately for my…mistake. It’s nothing two soldiers need concern themselves with.”\n“Oh, but it is, it is! And you’re wrong, by the way.”\n“About what?”\nRelc exchanged a glance with Klbkch. He grinned. Or rather, his mouth opened and he showed Pisces his teeth.\n“We’re no soldiers. We’re [Guardsmen]. And we’ve been looking for the bastard who’s been robbing homes with illusion spells.”\n“Ah.”\nFor a second, Pisces was very still. Then, with a surprising burst of speed, he sprinted for the door. Erin saw his legs move—then he\nflickered\nforwards.\nIt was like he teleported! One second he was there, the next, five feet away, lunging for the doorknob! But he stumbled, nearly falling over himself, arms flailing. He would have still gotten out except for how fast the two [Guards] reacted.\nRelc kicked himself back from the table as his right arm snatched the spear. That was why he had been sitting so far back—he whirled the spear up and\nthrew\nit in one motion. Erin was only aware of a blur of movement and the\nwhoosh\nof air past her face. She screamed, and his spear blew past her ear, but it didn’t strike Pisces. The spear flew between his legs as he tried to grab the doorknob and tripped him up. He sprawled to the ground as Relc pushed his chair back.\nKlbkch was already on his feet. Like Relc, he’d given himself plenty of space. He didn’t draw his swords, just strode over to Pisces and put one arm in a lock. Another of Klbkch’s arms held Pisces’ head down.\n“Do not move. You are under arrest for intimidation and attempted theft. Remain still. Any sudden moves will result in bodily harm.”\nWith one arm, Klbkch dragged Pisces up. The mage didn’t struggle as Klbkch deposited him back in his chair. Relc grinned at Erin as he picked up his spear. Pisces was panting, looking from Klbkch to Relc with clear unease.\n“Good throw, huh?”\nShe tried to answer and croaked.\n“Y-yeah.”\nRelc’s eyes widened slightly.\n“Oops. Sorry, did I scare you? I forgot normal people aren’t used to that. Don’t worry—I never miss when I throw.”\nErin kept looking at Pisces. His eyes darted around the room, but Klbkch was standing right over him. She nodded slowly—what were they going to do with…?\n“I’m sure. I’m sure. And I’m not scared. Just—surprised.”\n“Good, good.”\nRelc patted Erin gently on the back. She nearly fell out of her chair but caught herself on the table. He didn’t notice. Relc sauntered over to Pisces and grinned down at him.\n“Gotcha. Tried to run from me, did you? No one ever gets away.”\nHe looked over at his companion.\n“Klbkch, got anything to tie him up with?”\nKlbkch shook his head.\n“Alas, I did not anticipate an arrest, and my gear is signed out at the barracks. I am without manacles or spell-bind rope. We shall have to be attentive with its lack. Unless Miss Solstice has anything to bind him with?”\nKlbkch looked at Erin. She spread her hands. So there was a prison? In the city she’d never been to?\n“Uh, no. No, sorry.”\n“A pity. But we shall do without.”\n“Indeed you will. This is an affront!”\nPisces tried to push Klbkch away. His face was pale and sweaty, but he still maintained his haughty tone, if slightly strained.\n“I am completely innocent—utterly so. These baseless accusations are false and—”\n“You are lying.”\nKlbkch said it flatly and without a hint of doubt.\n“[Detect Guilt] is a basic Skill most [Guardsmen] get. I can sense your guilt, which is enough for me to justify this arrest.”\n“Plus, we already know all about you and your crimes.”\nRelc folded his arms and grinned even wider. His teeth were yellow, and very, very sharp.\n“We’ve been looking for you, Mister Mage. Or should I say, the scary creature that threatens travellers and people living by themselves? You’ve been stealing food and money for nearly a month. There’s even a bounty on your head, which I’d love to collect.”\nErin stared at Pisces, who’d turned a paler shade of white, but Relc wasn’t done.\n“Okay. Here’s what I’m thinking. Me and my friend here will drag you out back, beat you with sticks or rocks for a while, and then drag you back to the city for a reward. Then we’ll give half to our lovely innkeeper here. Sound good?”\nPisces’ smile was strained by now, and he shifted, but Klbkch was leaning on his shoulder, pressing him down in his seat.\n“Actually, I would prefer—”\n“Too bad!”\nRelc cracked his knuckles. Erin, who had been staring in fascination and horror, raised a hand.\n“Um. Isn’t that wrong?”\n“Wrong? Why would it be wrong?”\nErin searched for words as Relc stared at her blankly.\n“Aren’t there rules? Like, rules against police—guardsmen hurting people once they’re caught? Like…like no beating someone once they’re on the ground?”\nRelc stared at her. He turned to Klbkch.\n“Do we have rules like that?”\nKlbkch let go of Pisces to scratch at his head. He stepped back, but kept one hand on the hilt of his swords as he talked, keeping Pisces well within range.\n“I believe that may be a Human standard.”\n“Oh, good. I got worried there for a second.”\n“Yes, we wouldn’t want to ruin the enjoyment of mindless thugs like yourself.”\nPisces sneered at Relc. He seemed incapable of keeping his mouth shut even when it was for his own good. Relc made a fist, and he flinched.\n“Hold on, hold on. We don’t need to beat up Pisces. Like I said, he only\ntried\nto rob me. And I already hit him with a pot. What’s this about beating him up?”\nErin grabbed Relc’s arm. It was instinctive, but once she touched his scales, she nearly jumped away. His skin, or rather, scales, were surprisingly cool and easy to grip. But it felt so alien to Erin that she was quite unnerved. It made everything seem frighteningly real.\nRelc glanced at Erin and peeled her off gently. He was so strong that he broke her grip effortlessly with just two of his fingers.\n“Don’t worry, miss. We’ll do the punching outside where you don’t have to see.”\n“Or—\nor\nyou could not. Isn’t that what nice guardsmen do? You could just arrest him and skip the punching, right?”\nThe Drake nodded with a blank, uncomprehending, cheerful look on his face.\n“Yeah, but he called me a common thug. I want to punch him for that.”\n“Well—he’s a jerk. But I mean, you’re a guardsman. Insults like that are ten a penny.”\n“Ten a what?”\n“I believe she is saying insults to our position are quite common.”\nKlbkch clarified. He looked at Erin, who shrugged awkwardly and gave him a sheepish smile.\n“What?”\nRelc seemed slightly hurt. He looked at Erin with his eyes narrowed slightly. But rather than angry, that somehow made his face look sad.\n“No one insults me regularly. Except Watch Captain Z and Klb, come to think of it. People like me. Everyone likes us. We’ve got a special job.”\n“But one you sign up for, right? I mean, sure, it’s a great job, but—it’s just a job, right?”\nErin faltered. Relc was staring at her in disbelief. His tone rose in indignation.\n“It’s not\njust\na job. It’s a highly prestigious job! Not just anyone can be part of the city guard, let alone a Senior Guard.”\nErin blinked.\n“Really? I thought you just…signed up.”\nRelc scoffed. He turned to Klbkch.\n“Signed up? Can you believe this?\nHumans.\n”\nKlbkch was unimpressed. He carefully munched piece after piece of blue fruit.\n“Perhaps if you explained our function more properly there would be no need for outrage. Clearly, the nature of guardspeople differs culturally. I thought Humans did it quite similarly in the north, but…elaborate, Relc.”\n“Right, well. It’s still not—okay.”\nErin crossed her arms. Pisces sneered and took another swallow of juice from the table. He began mumbling to himself, but Erin, Relc, and Klbkch ignored him.\nRelc sighed. He scratched the spines at the top of his head.\n“Look, I’m not sure what Humans do, but in our city, the city watch isn’t like mercenaries or personal bodyguards. We don’t just sign up. We have to be voted in.”\n“Really?”\n“Really. See, we’ve gotta get at least fifty ordinary citizens to vouch for us before we’re sworn in. And to become Senior Guardsmen like us, you’ve got to get at least four hundred. Impressive, right?”\nRelc grinned and pulled something out of the belt at his waist. He showed Erin a crimson badge edged with gold and striped twice with purple. It was shiny. It had the logo of a city, well, a stylized city, over…Erin squinted. Was that water? Little wavy lines. It was quite beautiful, and she had to guess it was costly.\n“Nice. So that’s your official badge?”\nThe Drake polished it on his front as he placed it back in his belt pouch.\n“Yeah. We’ve got to keep it on us at all times. Some guys wear it on their chests, but it can get ripped off. Besides…”\nHe tapped his scaly arm.\n“Doesn’t stick so well on scales. Anyways, we’ve gotta pay a fine if we lose it, so why risk it, right? I only need it when I want to prove who I am or pull rank, anyways.”\n“Fascinating. But it’s still the elevated status of a common enforcer when all is said and done, isn’t it?”\nPisces sneered at Relc. He seemed full of confidence all of a sudden. Relc glared, making another fist the size of a brick.\n“You’re still under arrest. I can hit you. It’s only because I’m being considerate of Miss Solstice here that I don’t. But I will. If you don’t shut up.”\nEyebrows raised, Pisces drew a finger across his lips.\n“Pardon me. I would not dare to interrupt such august personages such as yourself. Please, proceed.”\nErin sighed, and Klbkch made a sound that sounded quite similar. Relc, on the other hand, just scratched his head.\n“Right. Good. Anyways, we’re the ones with weapons, and you’re just a [Mage]. Not a high-level one either or you’d be teleporting away.”\nKlbkch nodded.\n“Or destroying us in a number of ways. The lack of lightning falling from the sky or [Fireballs] confirms this.”\nErin, suddenly quite nervous, edged behind a table. Her\nwooden\ntable and the\nwooden\ninn.\n“You sure about that?\nReally\nsure, I mean?”\nRelc grinned at her. It was a grin with entirely too many teeth.\n“Don’t worry, Miss. He’s no threat or we’d have taken him out when we first realized who he was. He looked more dangerous than he turned out to be. You see, both of us can tell if we’re in danger or the enemy is strong. This idiot couldn’t even use [Flash Step] properly!”\nThe [Necromancer] turned beet red, but Erin was fascinated.\n“You can do that? Like—sensing each other’s power levels?\nReally?\nHow?”\nThe Drake’s mouth opened, and he eyed Klbkch, who scratched at his antennae. However, Pisces interrupted with a huge sneer of his own.\n“A keen observer would discern his opponent’s weaknesses and strengths and make assumptions based on their actions and ability. These two, on the other hand, are just using a Skill.”\nRelc eyed him. So did Klbkch, but it was more subtle. The Drake shrugged, unperturbed.\n“Well, he’s right. We do have Skills. They’re part of our classes, although in my case I’ve got [Dangersense]. But I’m also a former soldier. And Klb? He’s the\nSlayer.\nWe can tell you’re not hot stuff, Human.”\nSlayer? Erin glanced at Klbkch, and the Antinium’s mandibles lowered and came together as he stared at Relc. The Drake lifted a claw, wincing apologetically. What did that mean? He hurried on; if anyone reacted, it was Pisces, who turned dead white as he stared up at Klbkch.\n“My scales aren’t itching, so your Human friend here isn’t that good at magic. They always itch when I’m in danger. That’s not a Skill, either. But your friend can’t even trigger my [Dangersense]. Not even a little ring.”\nErin held up her hands, hesitating between Pisces and Klbkch.\nSlayer.\nDid that mean he slew…?\n“He’s not\nmy\nfriend.”\nRelc shrugged.\n“But he’s Human.”\nThe Drake said that like it meant everything.\n“That’s—”\nErin struggled for a response. Meanwhile, Pisces’ sneer deepened, and he curled his lip, oblivious to the danger.\n“Spoken like a truly ignorant fool. What would you know of magical mastery? My powers may not lie in mere confrontation, but I assure you, I have more power in my fingernails than you have in your entire brutish body.”\nRelc stepped forwards, fist raised.\n“Okay,\nthat’s it\n. Close your eyes, Miss—”\nFor one moment, Erin wasn’t sure if she wanted to get between Relc and Pisces or duck out of the way. Klbkch made the decision for her. He grabbed Relc, and pulled him back. Not easily; but there was more strength in those wiry ant arms than Erin would have guessed.\n“Relax. I would prefer not to damage this establishment. Nor would the owner or even you, I suspect.”\nRelc hesitated. He looked at Erin, who decided to add her support of denial.\n“Yeah, let’s calm down before someone gets hurt. Like me.”\nErin grabbed the jug of blue juice and began filling cups. Relc accepted a glass, drained it, and then sipped at the refill.\nErin went to fill Pisces’ glass, but he shielded it with one hand.\n“No—no need, good Mistress Solstice. I am quite satisfied at the moment.”\nRelc was still glaring daggers at Pisces.\n“Peh. You should drink. It’ll be the last tasty thing you eat for a long time. Actually, what am I saying? This stuff’s way too good for you. Just remember what you’re missing when we lock you away.”\n“If you can.”\nErin eyed Pisces. He was still sneering, and she wasn’t sure why. If she was any guess, Relc was two seconds away from turning his face into raw beef.\nRelc scowled. He closed his hand, and Erin watched his entire arm\nripple.\nShe’d seen ripped guys before, of course, which wasn’t that impressive, but this—\n“Last I checked, you were within arm’s reach. That means your fancy spells aren’t going to do a thing before I hit you hard enough to make your brains pop out. Trust me. I’ve done it before.”\nAgain, Pisces didn’t seem affected by Relc’s threat. At least visibly.\n“I am a powerful [Mage] far beyond your capabilities. Even if your paltry Skills cannot detect my—capabilities—you would do well to be wary of my hidden…capabilities.”\nHe seemed to have forgotten synonyms for ‘capability’, like potential, talent, ability, and so on. Erin had the unfortunate desire to laugh. But Klbkch didn’t twitch.\nThe Antinium moved his head slightly. His expression didn’t change, but then, there wasn’t much to change. He lowered one of his four hands to his side, and Erin saw the hand rest casually on the pommel of his dagger. More sweat beaded on Erin’s lower back.\n“Such as?”\nPisces drew himself up in his chair slightly.\n“I have studied countless schools of magic. You see before you a practitioner of the elements, a weaver of illusions, a refined chanter, a master of alchemy, pyromancy, aeromancy, geomancy—”\n“And necromancy.”\nErin helpfully chimed in. Pisces choked on his next words. He glared at her. She shrugged.\n“What? You told me yesterday. Oh, and were you the one who stole the skeleton upstairs? I just realized that was probably you.”\nPisces lost his sneer and now looked uneasy. Relc, on the other hand, grinned again.\n“Well, well. Theft of a corpse and reanimation, no doubt. That’s another big mark on the list of charges. But necromancy, well, that also means we don’t have to bring you back alive anymore.”\nErin opened her mouth, and Relc waved a hand. He looked exasperated as he glanced her way.\n“Yes, yes. But we’ll just hit you and drag you back so Miss Erin doesn’t see anything nasty. But you’re in serious trouble now, Mister [Necromancer].”\n“Oh, really?”\nPisces sat back in his chair. He was still pale, but he looked far more confident than he had any right to be.\n“Regardless if you know my identity or not, I still believe you will find capturing me no easy task.”\nRelc blinked. He scratched the spines on his head and then shook his head gently.\n“Humans. You’re so arrogant and crazy. It’s almost funny. If you’re so full of powerful magic, dodge this.”",

    "text": "He swung his spear forward, the butt of the spear first. Erin shouted and tried to grab the spear, too slowly. But where the spear should have cracked Pisces over the head, Relc’s swing met nothing but air. Pisces was suddenly gone.\n“What the—”\nRelc blinked. Erin gaped. Klbkch instantly swung his swords in an arc, slashing the air around the chair. But he touched nothing.\n“Gone.”\nRelc swiped the air where Pisces had been with his spear and growled deep in his throat. Erin stared.\n“He’s not invisible? He did that once.”\nRelc shook his head angrily.\n“No. I’d be able to sense if he were within a few feet of me. This was an illusion spell. A damn clever one, too. He pretended he was here and walked off while we were busy chatting. Most idiot spellcasters aren’t that stealthy or…when did he creep off? Klb, it was when you let go of him! I didn’t even see the chair move—damn, the chair’s an illusion too! Normally I can hear idiots skulking around even on the battlefield! This bastard tricked me!\nMe!\n”\nHe kicked a foot of the chair, and Erin\ngasped\nas the chair vanished and reappeared, further back. Klbkch looked to the door.\n“I am unsure of when he left. He may have escaped only a few minutes ago. We may still catch him if we hurry.”\n“Right, right.”\nRelc cursed and swung his spear angrily. It made a terrific\nwhooshing\nsound as it cut the air. Erin held her breath, afraid he’d let go and accidently cut her.\nKlbkch turned and bowed his head to her.\n“Thank you for informing us of his class, Mistress Erin. Although he posed no threat to either Relc or I, he is far more dangerous than we had believed. I did not notice the illusion spell. I have grown inattentive, lax. Relc as well, but this is a critical failing on my part.”\nThe Drake glared as Erin hesitated, looking at where Pisces had been sitting.\n“Really? I thought—he didn’t seem dangerous. I mean, I hit him with a pot, and that knocked him out.”\n“Oh, he’s probably as dangerous as a frog in a fight. That’s not the problem.”\nRelc shook his head.\n“We thought he was just an illusionist. That’s annoying, but really all he can do is scare folks into giving him things. But a necromancer’s worse. Far worse. We could let him go if he was just a normal [Mage], but we’ve\ngot\nto find him now, and he knows it.”\n“Why?”\nRelc muttered to himself. He was still looking around, and his tongue was flicking out of his mouth, as if tasting the air. It was the first time he’d really reminded Erin of a lizard from her world.\n“A rogue [Necromancer] on the loose does nasty things. Even a low-level one can bring down villages if you give him enough dead bodies, and they level\nfast\nwhen that happens. Damn, I’m not going to be the one who let the next Az’kerash get away, Klb. We’re gonna have to hunt this guy down. If we can’t catch him today, I’ll have the Captain send out multiple patrols once we get back to the city. Erin, we have to go, but I think you’re safe if that guy didn’t do anything last time.”\nErin nodded. Then she hesitated.\n“So. Does…that mean you’ll be back soon?”\nRelc nodded.\n“Less than an hour, but we won’t be able to stay. Sorry. I’ll try to get the patrol out faster, but you know how it is. We’ve got to shift around guardsmen on patrol, set trackers, get armed up, etc.”\n“Oh. Okay. But, uh, does that mean—how long does it take to get back?”\n“We should be able to cover the distance in approximately ten minutes if we run.”\nRelc nodded in agreement.\n“So we’ve gotta go. Why? Are you worried he’ll attack you?”\n“No, not that. It’s just—the city.”\n“The city? What about it?”\n“Um, where is it? Is it that\nteensy\nlittle wall of stone in the distance?”\nRelc and Klbkch stared at her silently and then exchanged a glance.\n“…You mean, you don’t know? By the way, things look smaller in the distance, Miss Solstice.”\n“I know that! I just don’t know what I’m seeing! Should I? It’s not like there’s a sign or anything around here. And I can’t see it at all times.”\nRelc looked amused.\n“Don’t be snippy. But it’s easy to spot. Look, you can even see it out the window here.”\nHe walked over to a window and pointed. Erin squinted. Now that he mentioned it, the viewpoint here\ndid\nlet her pick out that same landmark. It was just that she needed to look hard to spot the edge rising over a hill.\n“…Is it that grey stuff there?”\n“Well, yeah. Isn’t it obvious?”\n“No, it’s really not. It could be a rock. A square rock.”\n“It’s\nnot\na rock. Why are you having a hard time believing me? Can’t you see the buildings?”\n“No, I\ncan’t\n.”\n“I do not believe she can, in point of fact.”\nRelc and Erin turned to look at Klbkch. He studied her and then brought his face close to hers. Erin flinched as he did.\n“Do not be alarmed. I mean you no harm.”\n“Sorry—sorry. It’s just the pincers. And the eyes. It’s just—sorry.”\nRelc laughed.\n“Don’t mind Klbkch. He’s ugly even for an ant. But you really can’t see the city from here?”\nKlbkch nodded. He seemed focused on Erin’s own eyes.\n“I believe Humans have more limited eyesight than you or I.”\n“What? That’s stupid.”\nRelc huffed to himself. He pointed out the window at the black dot.\n“Look, the city’s that way. It’s only a twenty-minute walk, and there aren’t many monsters along the way. Besides, once you get within a few miles, the area is regularly patrolled, so you won’t have any problems. And if those idiots at the gate stop you—which they won’t—just tell them you know me.”\nKlbkch nodded.\n“Or me. However, you should encounter no problems. Only those with past records of crime are unwelcome in Liscor.”\n“And speaking of which…we’ve gotta go. It’s my day off, but we’ll report that annoying Human maggot-mage back at the barracks. If we move fast, we might get him before he runs too far.”\nRelc was on his feet. He moved so quickly that Erin was left gaping. One second he was sitting down, the next he was at the door.\n“Hey, Klbkch, coming?”\nAnd then Klbkch was there too. If Erin hadn’t seen the black blur that swept past her and felt the rush of air, she would have sworn he’d teleported.\n“Indeed. It is unfortunate we must leave so soon. Our apologies, Miss Solstice.”\n“No—no problem.”\n“Well then.”\nKlbkch nodded to her. Relc waved and was out the door in a flash. Erin was left sitting with a table full of dirty plates and a state of mild shock.\nShe had just picked up the first plate when the door slammed back open. She jumped, but Relc waved at her.\n“Oh, sorry we forgot to pay. We’re in a hurry so—put it on our tab!”\nThe door closed. Erin stared at it hopefully, but it didn’t open again.\n“…What tab?”\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "Erin stood in front of the cupboard and sighed. Loudly.\n“\nMen.\n”\nErin paused and thought about that word.\n“\nMales.\nThey eat and eat and eat. And then I have to clean up the dishes. Typical.”\nTrue, she was an [Innkeeper]. Or at least, she kept an inn relatively clean. But that didn’t make her feel better.\n“Pantry? Pantry is empty. Food? Food is gone. And money—”\nShe glanced at the pile of coins on the kitchen counter. Gold, silver, copper and…where had the gold come from?\nKlbkch. He’d put two down for his meal and Relc’s, one each time he’d come. Was that normal pricing? She guessed that if he was giving it to her, it was.\nErin dunked a plate in a bucket of water, the lye soap in her other hand. She used the dustrag to wipe at the plate, but then realized she needed a second bucket to clean everything off.\nShe decided she’d soap-wash the dishes, then she had to get another bucket from the stream…but her reward was the lovely coins. And less food. Assuming she had more money coming in than she spent, this was ideal—but she needed to spend it. That seemed to be the critical missing link in the way this business was working so far.\n“Money is shiny. But, uh, inedible. And it’s good to have money, but starvation is an issue.”\nErin stared at the empty pantry. She had a tiny scraping of butter left, a mostly empty jar of flour…starvation was a major issue.\n“Aren’t there some more blue fruits around here? Here? No…here? Yep. Nice and wrinkled. Lovely.”\nShe could always get more blue fruits, of course. But there was a limit on how many those trees had left. And there was also a limit to how many Erin was willing to keep hauling back.\n“And I’m out of ingredients.”\nThe flour was almost gone. The butter was all but gone. The salt—okay, there was some salt left and some sugar too. But they were running low in their jars, and with the lovely preservation-spell-thing gone, they’d probably turn rotten sometime soon.\n“So I’m in trouble.”\n“So it would appear.”\nThe second, droll voice was right in her ear. Erin was sure her heart stopped for a good few seconds. She turned around and looked at Pisces.\n“If I had a knife in my hand, I’d stab you.”\nHe smirked at her. It seemed to be his default mode of face. He stood up from where he had been crouching, invisible or concealed, in the corner of the kitchen.\n“Ah, but what good innkeeper would deprive herself of such a magnificent guest?”\nErin reached for a knife. Pisces lifted his hands instantly.\n“Please, please, good Mistress, let’s not be hasty!”\nHe took a few rapid steps back. Erin glared at him, but only let her hand rest on the counter. Pisces looked dusty. And dirty. And sweaty.\n“Where did you come from? I didn’t hear you come in through the door.”\nThe sneer was cut with genuine nervousness, but Pisces gestured upstairs smugly.\n“I was, in fact, upstairs the entire time. Under a bed. It was the simplest solution given the intelligence of those two brutish guardsmen.”\nErin blinked. He had dust-bunnies all over his hair and robes, which, granted, didn’t actually make him that much dirtier. She glanced towards the common room and nodded.\n“Good job, I guess. But they’re still going to find you. You’re a criminal, and you’ve got nowhere to hide.”\n“Except here.”\nHe raised a hand before Erin could say anything.\n“Please, hear me out. Rest assured, I bear you no ill will for reporting my actions to the guard. I fully appreciate the severity of my crimes, however—”\n“You want something. What? To stay here? No. Nope. No way in hell.”\nPisces lifted his hands and put on what she supposed was his best smile. It made him no less desperate, but he spoke quickly and eloquently. A scholar? Erin supposed a [Mage] was probably scholarly.\n“I assure you I would be a quite convivial guest. And I wouldn’t ask for much. In fact, you may be interested to know I am proficient in multiple schools of spellcasting. While necromancy is a—passion of mine, I have extensively studied the elementalist, illusory, and enchanting schools of magic. My level is over twenty in the general [Mage] class. Even amongst my fellow students, you would be hard-pressed to find a spellcaster as widely capable as I am. I can aid in a number of functions that would improve your inn. And I have money.”\nErin raised two eyebrows. One just wasn’t enough.\n“And you’re telling me all this…why?”\nHe licked his lips.\n“In point of fact, I was wondering if I might persuade you to shelter and provide me with my basic necessities while in this moment of dire need. I can provide you with adequate recompense, I assure you—”\nErin snorted rudely.\n“Right, for how long? Days? Weeks? Months? And I get to feed you, make sure no one finds you, and clean up after you? Again: no. I’m barely getting enough food for myself as it is.”\n“Would you turn away an innocent—”\nErin’s finger nearly jabbed him in the chest as he stepped back. The young woman raised her voice as Pisces retreated out of the kitchen.\n“\nInnocent?\nYou? You’re nothing more than a thug with a magic wand. Remember how we met? You tried to scare me into giving you food. And now you want protection because you’re getting your just desserts? No. No, when I see Relc again, you’d better be long gone from here. And if you don’t leave now, I’ll kick you out myself.”\nErin finished her tirade and folded her arms under her breasts. But while Pisces had turned white as a sheet, he didn’t look ashamed or afraid so much as…\nAngry.\nHe whispered a spell. Erin felt the air grow colder around her and suddenly saw shadows twisting around Pisces’ hands. The darkness was gathering around him like a cloak. It was the same spell as before, or close enough.\nPisces took a step towards her.\n“I am a man in desperate straits. You would do well not to underestimate what I am capable of.”\nErin’s heart was racing. She took two steps back, and he followed.\n“Antagonizing one of my power is unwise. If you have any sense, you will accede to my request. Or know the consequences.”\nHer mouth was dry, but she knew it was just an illusion. So Erin forced herself to reply with more bravado than she felt.\n“So, what? If I don’t decide to help you, will you hurt me? Bash my brains in? Or will you just rip my clothes off and try to rape me?”\nHe looked shocked.\n“Of course I wouldn’t do\nthat\n. I’m no barbarian—”\n“Good.”\nErin’s hand moved in a flash. Pisces looked down and gulped. A knife was poking into his stomach.\nHer heart was racing. She could taste bile in her mouth. But her hand was very, very still. She wasn’t sure of much in her life right now. Magic and monsters made her head spin. Yet some things were the same. And she had no intention of being the victim here, especially where no one could hear her scream.\nHer knife had a gratifying effect on her mage guest. He licked his lips and raised his hands, turning a shade paler than normal.\n“Now, now. Let’s not be hasty, good Mistress. I was merely saying—”\n“Move and I will stab you.”\nIt was no threat. It was a promise. And, to his credit, Pisces was intelligent enough to take it seriously.\n“—Allow me to apologize. But if I might say a few words—”\n“No. Out.”\nErin advanced. Pisces had to step backwards or be knifed in slow motion. She forced him back into the common room and towards the door.\n“Please, please reconsider.”\n“No.”\nHis face was so desperate Erin paused a second.\n“\nWhy should I?\nGive me one good reason, Pisces.”\nPisces stopped at the door. Erin jabbed at him with the knife, but he refused to move back any further. He raised his hands higher and spoke with increasing speed and panic.\n“If I am caught, they will take me to the city. And there I will be judged and killed. This is a certainty, Mistress Erin.”\nErin eyed him uncertainly. Pisces was licking his lips, and he looked genuinely afraid. But she couldn’t quite trust him after his threats. Posturing aside—there was the way he was looking at her, too. He didn’t really trust her, did he? Oh, no. And she didn’t trust him. But the part about being executed? Erin frowned hard.\n“Relc never said—”\n“He didn’t want to tell you the truth! But he and I both know what happens to [Necromancers]. We—any mage possessing even a single level in the class—are all killed on sight in this part of the world! There’s no mercy for my kind here. The legacy of the Necromancer of Terandria, Az’kerash, lingers. Especially\nhere,\nwhere his armies once sieged Liscor.”\n“Well—well too bad.”\nErin’s mouth was on autopilot. Pisces tried to step around her back into the kitchen, but she blocked him, forcing him to the door.\n“Even if you’re in danger,\nI’m\nin danger if I hide you. I’m not doing that. Run away. Just run away now.”\n“They will have patrols out around the city. They will scour the grasslands for me. Please, if you were to hide me, I would be sure to survive.”\n“No.\nGo.\n”\nErin pointed towards the door with one hand. He wavered, but made one last entreaty.\n“Please, I beg of you. Just one night. Just give me sanctuary, and I swear I will be gone upon the morrow. It is my death without your aid. Would you kill me? I ask you as a fellow Human.\nPlease.\n”\n“I—”\nThe knife in her hands wavered. Pisces seized the moment. He stepped forwards, hands outstretched beseechingly.\n“Please, spare my life. If you have any pity in your soul—”\nThudthudthudthudthud.\nPounding footsteps. Both Humans turned and looked at the door. Pisces turned white, and Erin heard a roaring,\nfamiliar\nvoice.\n“\nGotcha!\n”\nIt was quick. One second, Erin was pointing her finger at the door and glaring at Pisces. The next,\nsomething\nkicked the door open, blew past her, and Pisces was gone. Two figures\ncrashed\ninto a table and chairs. Erin’s mouth dropped open.\n“There you are!”\nThe larger shape uttered a triumphant laugh as he swung Pisces around and slammed him into the floorboards. It was Relc. He came through the door and took Pisces down in a tackling charge faster than\nanyone\nErin had ever seen. Pisces didn’t even make a sound until he hit the ground—and then it was the sound of someone losing all the air in his body and perhaps having his lungs and ribs compressed.\n“Miss Solstice.”\nKlbkch appeared at her side. Erin jumped, but the ant man placed a steadying…hand on her shoulder.\n“Please forgive my rudeness. Are you well? We doubled back and lingered, knowing the criminal may have only pretended to flee the area. Are you hurt or in need of assistance?”\n“What?”\nErin stared at him.\n“Are you—what’s—I’m good. Good.”\n“That is well. Then, please stand clear. We will be going about our business, and I would not wish you hurt.”\nThat said, Klbkch gently guided Erin to one side. To her astonishment, the fight between Relc and Pisces wasn’t over. The two were rolling around, knocking over tables and chairs as the Drake attempted to smash the Human into anything he could while the Human tried to avoid that fate.\nRelc roared from the ground.\n“\nKlb!\nGet over here and help! This guy’s slipperier than he looks!”\nKlb nodded to Erin and dashed into the fight. She watched in stupefaction as the two tried to hold Pisces down. Oddly, it wasn’t that easy. Despite the size advantage and muscle advantage, Pisces was still managing to fend off both. Erin wondered how, until she saw he had something in his hands.\nThe wand.\nIt was jetting electricity, as if it were an electric wire. Electricity, flames, which Relc jerked back from. He swung a fist, and Pisces\nvanished\nagain. This time, he slammed so hard into a table Erin winced as he tried to get up.\nPisces scrambled to his feet and leapt for the door, but Klbkch caught him by the foot and attempted to tie his hands together with a piece of string, which turned out to be his boot’s shoelaces. Pisces shouted…\nsomething,\nand the leather burst into flames. Relc leapt on him and then blinked.\n“[Barrier of Air]!”\nPisces waved his wand, and the Drake\nsmashed\ninto a shimmering whirlwind of air, bounced off, and landed on the ground. He ducked under the shimmering…spell? Erin was transfixed, but then Klbkch took Pisces down with a leg-sweep. He didn’t reach for his swords—he dodged a shard of\nstone\nthat pierced the air next to his head, pinned Pisces’ hand—and then made a\nclicking\nsound of exasperation as Relc knocked both him and Pisces over in a low charge.\nPisces got back up, slashed the air with his wand, and both Klbkch and Relc ducked a glowing blade, throwing themselves flat as Pisces backpedaled.\nIt was a fast and dirty fight that had one or all three of the fighters rolling on the ground at all times. But Erin had only half an eye for that. The other eye was watching all of the furniture in her inn get smashed as they fought.\n“Stop moving! Hey!”\n“Desist your actions or—”\nPisces’ fingers sparked. A small explosion of lightning blasted Klbkch into a wall as Relc ducked. Erin ducked too. From behind her table, she could see Klbkch twitching and making a distressed\nbuzzing\nsound. Then the Antinium drew his swords. Relc roared.\n“You\nsquirming—\n”\nThe dull\nthud\nof something hitting something echoed throughout the inn. But it was punctuated by another crackle of electricity and Relc shouting in pain.\nErin turned away from the brawl and ran into the kitchen. She emerged with the pot just in time to see Relc blasted off his feet, this time by what looked like an explosion of air.\nPisces backed away from the Drake, panting heavily. His face was bruised and he was bleeding from the nose and mouth, but his fingers still crackled with energy. He turned to run, but stopped.\nKlbkch was on his feet. The ant man was standing in front of the door, swords drawn. He held two, one in each hand, while his other two held small daggers. Erin saw Pisces gulp. She agreed. Klbkch looked like a wall of blades. The two [Guardsmen] had gone after Pisces unarmed while he had his wand. Now that Klbkch had drawn his blades, Erin felt like the odds were completely reversed.\n“I—I seek no quarrel with you. I am a graduate of Wistram Academy and a practicing mage. You detain me at your peril.”\nPisces pointed a trembling finger at Klbkch. It sparked with green energy that crackled around his fingertip, but it was suddenly a lot less impressive compared to Klbkch’s armory.\n“Regardless of your affiliation to any academy, you are still under arrest. Please surrender now or I will be forced to employ lethal force.”\nPisces hesitated.\n“My magic—”\n“Is useless. Surrender.”\n“Surrender?”\nErin jumped. She saw Relc getting to his feet. The Drake’s eyes were narrowed, and in his hands was a spear. It wasn’t long, but it did look extremely sharp. And the way he held it, Erin instinctively knew he was ready to use it to kill.\nPisces took one look at the spear and immediately raised his hands.\n“I—I give up.”\nRelc spat. His leather chest armor was singed in multiple places, but the scales underneath only looked soot-blackened, not damaged. However—Erin could tell how furious he was. The Drake’s claws tightened on the spear.\n“Not likely. I’m gutting you like a fish right here.”\nErin stared at Relc in horror. But there was no joking in his eyes. He was practically quivering with rage, but the arms that held his spear were completely still and tensed.\n“Gutting? Hey, that’s—”\n“Don’t be hasty!”\nPisces backed away from Relc, talking fast.\n“I assure you, my life is worth far more than you would ever get for me dead. This can all be solved amicably. I will fully cooperate—”\n“\nCooperate?\n”\nRelc stepped forwards, and Pisces pressed his two fingers together. A strong breeze flew through the inn, and a flickering barrier of wind appeared in front of Relc.\n“I will cease all magic and go with you quietly if you assure my life. I meant no harm to you or your companion. But we are at an impasse until you do.”\nRelc’s eyes narrowed.\n“By that? You think a piddly little [Barrier of Air] spell is going to stop me?”",

    "text": "The big Drake’s body tensed. He crouched slightly and then dashed into the wind wall. Relc’s massive body smashed into the semi-transparent barrier of wind. He sunk into the barrier, and then the winds pushed back.\nEven from this distance, Erin felt the tremendous force in the spell and saw chairs and tables being blown away. For a moment, she thought Relc would go flying. But his claws dug into the ground, and the wind howled—\nThe whirling winds blew apart with a small\nclap\nof air that sent the nearest chairs flying. Pisces staggered back, face grey with shock. Erin stared.\nRelc, on the other hand, just twirled his spear in his hand. He spat contemptuously on the floor.\n“\nThat’s\nwhat I think of your spells. I’m a former soldier of the 4th Wing of the Liscorian Army. I’ve killed more [Mages] than you have levels. Now, are you going to die quiet or will I have to pay for painting the walls red with your blood?”\nPisces stepped back, tripped over a fallen chair, and fell on his back. He raised his hands and cried out in a shrill voice.\n“I can be ransomed. Quite highly! My school will pay ten—\nthirty\ngold coins in whichever denomination you like for my return.”\nRelc raised the spear.\n“Still don’t care. I don’t need money if I can get rid of a stinking fleshbag like you.”\nErin raised her voice in horror.\n“What?\nNo!\nNo killing! Do you hear me?”\nBut no one was listening. Klbkch was closing in, swords and daggers at the ready. Relc raised his spear higher.\n“Last words, [Mage]?”\n“I—I—”\nShe couldn’t believe what was happening. The friendly Relc was lowering his spear, a dozen paces away from the backpedaling Pisces. But he could close that gap in less than a second. His eyes—\nHe was going to kill Pisces.\nAnd Klbkch wasn’t going to stop him. Erin’s head swung to the Antinium, and Klbkch stood by the door, impassive. She couldn’t read his face, and in that second, he looked like a true insect. Pisces was white with fear. Erin was in denial until she saw the Drake’s eyes. Even then…she saw Pisces hit a table. He looked at Relc and grew calm for a second.\nThat bitter, blank look returned to his face. He bared his teeth and lifted the wand like a dagger. It glowed, but with no real hope. Just like his eyes. But he drew himself up, a pale, thin young man, and shouted, eyes bulging, his voice hoarse and—Erin’s head swung to him as he raised his voice.\n“\nI have only ever done what I loved. Slay me as well, you thoughtless fools. Just like all of my kind. One day—one of us will follow Az’kerash.\n”\nErin’s skin crawled. Klbkch looked up sharply, but Relc just grinned with all his teeth. His tongue flickered around them, like blood.\n“Nice last words. But remember—your Necromancer died here. Miles from this very spot. The Tidebreaker was his end.”\nPisces’ look of defiance flickered. He lifted his wand.\n“I know.”\nThe Drake lowered his spear and ducked, sweeping low as Pisces took one step forwards, a word, a name on his lips.\n“Gewil—”\n“\nHey!\n”\nErin\nslammed\nthe pot on the table top as hard as she could. Relc, Klbkch, and Pisces paused as one to stare at her. Relc froze in his killing charge as Erin pointed one shaking finger at them.\n“No fighting. Not here. And no killing!”\nRelc blinked. He lowered his spear a fraction. Erin pointed to it.\n“Stop that! Put the weapons away and get out.”\n“But he’s—”\n“I don’t care! You don’t kill people just because they practice stupid magic! And you don’t kill people just because you don’t like them! And you don’t kill people because killing people is wrong!”\n“\nWhat?\n”\nRelc pointed down at Pisces angrily. He didn’t lower his spear, but Pisces had stopped mid-cast of whatever spell he had in mind.\n“He’s a\ncriminal.\n”\n“No, he’s an idiot. But he didn’t do anything wrong enough to die for. All he did was try to scare me.”\n“He hit me with lightning!”\nThe Drake gestured at the burns on his chest. Erin pointed to Pisces’ bleeding nose and bruised cheek.\n“You punched his brains out! That’s not enough to kill him over!”\nThe Drake lowered his spear. He turned to Klbkch in disbelief, then back to Erin.\n“I can’t believe this. Are you defending him? Because he’s Human? Or do you not want the blood in here? In that case, I’ll take him out back and—”\n“\nNo!\n”\nErin shouted at Relc. She waved the pot around dangerously.\n“Are you stupid? I don’t want anyone killing anyone! You can’t do it! I forbid it! It’s wrong! It’s illegal.”\n“In point of fact, my comrade’s actions are not—”\nErin whirled and pointed at Klbkch. The Antinium actually backed up a step as she glared between the two [Guards].\n“I don’t care! No killing, do you hear me?”\nRelc\nhissed\nangrily.\n“Then I’ll arrest him, and he’ll be executed tomorrow. Happy?”\nPisces turned pale again. Erin’s mouth replied before her brain caught up.\n“I withdraw my testimony.”\n“You\nwhat?\n”\nErin lifted her hands.\n“I withdraw it. All of it. I was never attacked yesterday. This mage-guy never visited the inn, and I never saw him until today. So there’s no reason for you to arrest him.”\n“You can’t do that!”\nRelc turned and looked at Klbkch.\n“Can she?”\nThe ant man nodded reluctantly.\n“She is correct. Without her testimony, we cannot submit a report regarding his attempted thefts.”\nRelc faltered. He looked uncertainly at Pisces and then remembered.\n“But he’s still a [Necromancer]! That’s a crime no matter what he does! And he attacked us!”\nErin crossed her arms.\n“Prove it.”\n“\nWhat?\n”\n“Prove. It. Can you? Is there a way to check his, uh, class?”\nRelc gritted his teeth.\n“…No. Not without an artifact. Klb, you got an [Appraisal] scroll?”\n“No.”\n“Then go. Now.”\nRelc gaped at Erin. It was surprisingly frightening. Erin could look right down his throat. He had a lot of teeth.\n“Are you serious? One word to our Watch Captain and she’ll send a patrol back to capture this idiot! And if we don’t arrest him, you have a [Necromancer] running around! You want us to let him go\nknowing\nhis class?”\n“Absolutely.”\nErin glared at him. Relc lowered his spear, grabbed at the spines on his head, and\nhissed\n.\n“I could still arrest him for attacking me. Yeah. I’ll just do that. Who cares about testimony or whatever?”\nHe took a threatening step towards Pisces, and Erin’s mouth once again beat anything else.\n“You do that—and I’ll tell all the people who vouched for you that Senior Guardsman Relc arrested someone after a fight\nhe\nstarted. You have no proof, no testimony, and I’m pretty sure if you arrest him, that’s illegal. There\nare\nlaws, and you have to follow them. If this isn’t the first time you’ve done something like this, you could get a permanent citation on your record.”\nErin was just making things up now. She had no idea what kind of legal system Relc had to work under, but she was taking a guess based on their limited conversations. And it worked. Relc hesitated.\n“No, I can’t.”\n“Yes, you can. You have no cause whatsoever to arrest Pisces.”\nThe Drake’s arms were bunched up. He turned, furiously, and called in backup.\n“Klb—help me out here!”\nErin’s heart sank as Klbkch sheathed his daggers. But only so he could pull out something from his belt. A handbook. How had he fit it on his belt?\nWherever he’d gotten it from, the Antinium read carefully.\n“I believe Senior Guardsman Relc does have just cause, Miss Erin Solstice. It is true that his personal sworn testimony would be called into question if you were to speak against him. [Detect Truth] spells would settle that matter, but Relc’s history of inappropriate conduct on-and-off-duty does not help his case.”\n“Hey.”\nThe Antinium raised one finger.\n“\nHowever.\nAs Senior Guardsman Klbkch, I will vouch for my partner to take this Human into custody for unlawful practices which include extortion, theft, and intimidation, which we have every right to suspect, with or without your testimony.”\nHe closed the book, and Relc waited, clearly unsure if that meant he had won. Erin’s heart sank. She looked at Klbkch and then at Pisces. And then around her inn. How could she save him? For once, she didn’t want the [Guardsmen] to be…\nHere?\nHere?\nErin’s eyes lit up, and she stopped Klbkch, who was stepping towards Pisces to effect the arrest, with a shaking finger. Literally—she shook it in his face as the surprised Antinium halted.\n“Oh no. Absolutely not. You’re all wrong, Klbkch.”\n“I do not believe I am.”\nErin’s shaking intensified, from nerves as much as faux-fury.\n“Oh yeah?\nOh yeah?\nWell, this is\noutside your jurisdiction!\nYou said it yourself—you don’t patrol my inn! Therefore, it is\nmy\ninn, and I deny your city’s authority here!”\nKlbkch’s mandibles opened and stayed there. Relc swung his head to Pisces and Erin.\n“Wait—what did she just say? Jurisdic—we don’t do that, do we, Klb? Buddy?”\nErin froze, but Klbkch clacked his mandibles after a second. He stared at Erin for a long moment, then at Pisces, then slowly sheathed his swords. He met the [Innkeeper]’s desperate gaze—then nodded.\n“…I believe I am incorrect. Relc, the Watch has no authority here. This is an independent inn, and the [Innkeeper] is allowed to deny our authority here.”\n“What? Then let’s arrest\nher\ntoo!”\nRelc protested, and Erin’s heart sank, but Klbkch stared at Erin for a long moment and then backed up.\n“That would be inadvisable, Relc. We are off-duty, and Miss Solstice has stated her case. Executing a [Mage] of Wistram might also affect the Academy’s relationship with our city. Which the Council and Watch Captain would not be happy about.”\nRelc spluttered. He looked from Pisces to Klbkch to Erin, and his scales grew darker. Was he…blushing with fury? Relc lowered his spear, made an inarticulate noise of rage, then pointed at Pisces.\n“You take one step in the city and I’ll—I’ll—you take one step in there and I’ll do something about it. If I so much as see you on my patrol—”\nPisces was panting, looking at Erin with disbelief. He lowered his wand, slowly, and spoke.\n“I assure you, you will never\nsee\n—”\nRelc’s eye twitched.\n“\nShut up.\n”\nPisces wisely shut up. The Drake looked at Erin, then whirled around. He stomped towards the door.\n“\nHumans!\n”\nRelc kicked the door as he left. Erin winced as she heard the wood\ncrack\n. Then he was gone.\nKlbkch walked past Erin and nodded to her politely.\n“Do not mind him. You are within your rights to enforce law within this establishment as you choose. I apologize for the mess on both our behalves.”\nHe left. Erin stood around the room, looking at the broken chairs, overturned tables, and general wooden carnage. Behind her, Pisces got to his feet. He was still shaking and sweatily pale.\n“I don’t know how I can thank you, good M—Miss Erin. Please, accept my humblest—”\nBonk.\nErin tapped him on the head with the pot. Hard.\n“Out.”\n“What?”\nPisces stared at her in disbelief. Erin raised the pot higher.\n“Out.”\nHe stumbled out. Erin kept staring at the mess in the room. It had to be said. Definitely.\n“\nMales.\n”\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

Erin Solstice was tired, still shaky from the adrenaline and panic in her veins, but she was oddly—satisfied.\nDespite the crack in her front door, she carefully locked it with the big, iron key she found. Despite the angry Relc and the damaged inn, her only reward from the huge fight—she was satisfied.\nBecause the young man wasn’t dead. She had put herself on the line to save him.

    "text": "It was night here as well. Despite it being across the entire world, continents away. The deepest blackness of night, so late dawn was only an idea yet.\nHowever, many remained awake. They had not slept, in fact, for days, not truly, just traded on and off shifts. Laboring to finish a project decades in the making.\nSome stood out of pride and dedication alone. Their eyes had begun to sink into hollow sockets.\nMen and women. Humans and…people with pointed ears. Feathery people, even a woman clad all in armor, her disembodied head floating next to her body. They all shared the same purpose, the same ideal.\nThe same kingdom. Now, they took their spots in the glowing diagram, and it covered the floor, so vast that the audience, standing well away from the lines of power, had to crane their necks as they waited for the final piece of this—hope.\nThis ritual. They were far too deep underground to see the sky, but two moons, one pale green and the other light blue, hung fully in the sky. That was necessary too.\nThere was so much magic in the air that it was beginning to distort the world visually. It was necessary; and it might not be enough, even with this.\nThe man in the center of it all continued to chant, as he had for hours, now. His voice was wavering, hoarse and cracked from the strain of talking so long. He wore the robes of a [High Mage], and he was festooned with artifacts. Each word was being checked by terrified apprentices and [Scholars].\nIndeed, even the leader of this odd congregation was following the magical incantation, though he was no [Mage]. None of them were basic ‘[Mages]’. Not here. Not this kingdom of blight and glorious despair.\nThe leader was a man, a [King]. He looked younger from a distance. Barely seventy years old. Barely…and far younger than those with pointed ears. Until you stared into his eyes and saw true age looking back. Age and despair and defiance and—in this moment—hope.\nThe Blighted King stood, despite the late hour, with a giant of a woman by his side. A warrior with a scar down her cheek and a hand on the throwing axe at her side. She was wary, despite being clad in armor, of a trick, of failure—the Blighted Queen could do nothing but watch.\nThe same for the nobility, their guards, and even the lesser [Mages]. Only one person could follow what was happening fully, and it was the man who stood on the Blighted King’s right side.\nHe looked—thirty? Thirty and sixty. Young and old. Time was odd about him, and his hand curled over the grip of a staff as well as the floating spellbook from which he was reading. He was the most tense of anyone here. If anyone would stop this at its zenith and bear the consequences, or avert calamity—it would be him.\nBut everything was going well. Impossibly well, in fact. One of the participants was looking around. Whispering to the others. There was so much\npower\nhere. More than they had brought. Then she fell silent, tongue-tied.\nA [Lord] drew his sword and watched the light\nbend.\nThe [Soldiers] moved uneasily, because they had no idea what was happening. The congregation, the ritual itself, all focused on a point in the air. A split in…\nEverything? The [Mage] in the center of it all wept, his eyes beginning to bleed. He was so exhausted.\nBut his task was nearly done.\nThe spell was completing.\nIt was not a clap of thunder. It was not the\nboom\nof space-time being rent. Rather, it was a whisper. Something grew thin. A veil tore ever-so-slightly. The light changed, drew inwards just for an imperceptible second; the wind blew in this deep cavern impossibly—and then they were there.\nHumans.\nYoung men and women. They appeared mid-motion, some sitting, some lying down. Some walked out of the air, looked up from their smartphones in bewilderment. Bewilderment—then shock, panic. Fear or disbelief.\n“What?”\n“Where am I?”\n“What’s\nhappening?\n”\nThey shouted in alarm as a\nsigh\nran through the waiting people. The [King] was on his knees, and his [Queen] was helping him up. The [Mage] beside the Blighted King had his staff raised, but his eyes were filled with disbelief.\nPanic and chaos below as people rushed around, but every eye was on the Humans. They were so\nyoung.\nSo few for the cost paid. And they had no idea what was going on.\nSome of the summoned Humans were crying out in fear. Others tried to run in their panic but found their legs wouldn’t cooperate with them. A few stared around the room, noting the magic runes by their feet, the robed men and mages clustered together, and the watching aristocracy.\nUncertainty hung in the air, from those waiting for this moment to those called forth. But it was the [Mage] who spoke. He stumbled up from the dying ritual, and his voice filled the echoing chamber.\nA wheeze. A pained laugh. The relieved hysteria of hope. The [Mage] raised his arms, robes falling about him, and fell to his knees. His face, stained with bloody tears and watery ones, raised to the heavens as he cried out.\n“The Great [Heroes] of Prophecy are here! We are saved!”\nIt was one voice at first—then the others took it up. [Mages], [Soldiers], onlookers cheering in relief as the group of Humans drew together in fear. Some of those watching simply collapsed in…hope?\nBut others watched with calculating, appraising glances. The [King] rose, beckoning, and the young people waited. There was nowhere to run—but they weren’t in danger. Yet. They were confused. Lost. Far from home.\nAnd they were not the only ones.",

    "text": "The night was old, and dawn was only an hour away. The countryside, here, was full of chirping crickets, owls, the sounds of insects buzzing, and so on. Or at least, on a normal night it would be. Right now, all was silent. Unnaturally silent.\nAn old man stood outside his home, sword drawn. The night was dark, and by all rights, he should have been in his home enjoying his dinner. But he heard something outside and had gone to investigate. This far out in the countryside, he couldn’t rely on militia patrols to keep him safe.\nIf it were a monster, he would run, naturally. On the other hand, a lone Goblin or a [Sneak Thief] trying to steal from him would meet his sword. He had been a [Swordsman], and he was more than strong enough to defend himself. Still, he was no fool. If it were [Bandits] en-masse or worse, he’d report to the Adventurer’s Guild.\nHe had to know.\nHis grip was sweaty on the leather-wrapped pommel. Something was out there. The man hesitated—then shouted into the night.\n“Who’s there?”\nHe almost hoped there would be no reply. The night was too still, though. And then—somehow, they were there.\nThey hadn’t been a second ago. They were no [Rogues] or invisible folk. But one second he sensed nothing and the next they were standing out of sight. The [Swordsman]’s hand was tight on his sword, and he backed up towards his house. Until he saw them.\nSlowly, they approached. Hands raised, as pale with fear as he was.\nChildren.\nThat was the first thing the old man thought.\nChildren.\nBut then, he was old. Not all were that young. They were younger men and women. But children—because of how they looked. Lost, afraid. More afraid of him and the darkness than he was of them.\nHumans? He hesitated, then put down his sword. If this were a trick—he called out, hoping they were no monsters or [Bandits]. The terror on their faces was too good to be an act. He hoped.\n“Oh, are you young’uns lost? Come in, come in. The weather’s far too terrible to be out at a time like this.”\nHis sword sheathed, he opened the door to his home, letting light spill out invitingly. But none of the children moved. They just…stared at him. That was when the old man’s hair began to prickle a second time.\nSomething else was wrong. Their clothes were strange. He had never seen such—odd attire. Even in the darkness, he could tell there was something different about the fabric, the colors.\nNobility?\nNow he regretted sheathing his sword. But they\nwere\nHuman, and if this were a trap…\nThe terror on their faces.\nWas a large city burning? Hair was rising all over his arms and along his back. Had Invrisil fallen or…?\nAt last, one of them broke the silence. A young man pointed a trembling finger, and the old man nearly drew his sword again. Because the finger was pointing at him. But—rather than anything behind him, a warning—the finger just pointed at his side. The young man gulped and then finally asked—\n“Dude. Is that a sword?”",

    "text": "Erin woke up. Generally, this was an ordeal. Today, however, it was fairly easy. Because the real ordeal would come later.\nSuch as right after breakfast. Erin stared glumly at the three shriveled blue fruits on her plate. She bit the first experimentally and chewed. And chewed. And chewed.\n“Rubbery.”\nIt was incredibly difficult to chew the fruits. The skins on these ones were so tough to bite into, it did remind Erin of eating rubber. Not that she’d ever done that since she was a baby.\nPlus, they’d lost their delicious juices and tasted—well,\nflat\n. There was no sweetness left in them, and they were quite, quite unappetizing when you put all these qualities together. But Erin ate them, mainly because she had nothing left to eat.\n“I’m in trouble. Yup, yup. It’s amazing these things lose so much taste after only a few days.”\nIt wasn’t that she was out of blue fruits. There were plenty—well, some—still ready to be harvested from the orchard. But they, like all food, were in limited supply. Besides, the issue wasn’t that. It was her guests.\n“Who’d want to eat blue fruits all day? Raise your hand if that sounds like fun.”\nErin didn’t raise her hand. Granted, they were tasty and made a good fruit drink, but when you got down to it, they were still just fruits.\n“And I want food.\nReal\nfood. Not fruit. I want bread! I want pasta! I want pizza and soda and salad and ice cream—actually, forget the ice cream. I need\nmeat.\nOr fish that doesn’t bite back! I want sushi, cheeseburgers and fries, toast, waffles…cereal…”\nErin pressed her hands to her rumbling stomach and tried not to cry.\n“Even instant ramen would be nice. Is that too much to ask?”\nIt was. She knew that. But just thinking about the food made her tear up a bit. She could handle Goblins. She could deal with rude [Necromancers] and fight off evil rock crabs. She could even handle giant fish that tried to nibble on her when she took a bath. But she wanted\nfood.\n“Plus, I need to feed my guests.”\nErin nodded. The math was simple. No food equaled no guests equaled no money equaled starvation. But the little flaw in the equation was that in order to get the food, she’d need to spend the money. And she had no way of doing that.\n“Unless I go to the city.”\nNow, that was a thought. She wasn’t sure if that was a good thought, but it was the only option she had available. The city. Erin went to the window. Relc had shown her where it was…\n“There.”\nErin stared at the small buildings in the distance. It looked far. But then, everything looked far around here. And the city would have things. Like food. And clothing. And toothbrushes. And plates and things for her guests? It looked a\nlot\nfarther than twenty minutes away, though. Erin imagined the journey wasn’t without risks, but if Relc and Klbkch did it…she weighed her options.\n“It’s far. But I have to go. Maybe? Yes…no. No? Yes. I need food. And I need to feed my guests. It’s my duty as an innkeeper.”\nShe paused and thought about that last statement. Erin collapsed into a chair and cradled her head in her hands.\n“Am I an innkeeper? Is that what this world is doing to me?”\nMaybe. It was probably the [Innkeeper] class. However, it was the only class she had. Erin just hoped she didn’t change to meet the class.\n“I’ll grow a huge beer belly and start hauling around kegs of ale. That’s what innkeepers do, right?”\nShe didn’t actually know. It wasn’t as if she’d ever paid that much attention to medieval history, at least the parts that were actually history.\n“They never mentioned innkeepers in the legend of King Arthur. Or did they?”\nThere was no Google to help her, so Erin abandoned that train of thought. Really, she was distracting herself. She knew what she had to do today.\n“To go to the city or not, that is the question. Actually, there’s no question. I need to go to the city. I need to go…\nshopping.\n”\nShe hated shopping in general. This? This would be crucial shopping, because unless she got enough flour, eggs, and so on to sell to her guests—she wouldn’t be able to make more money. Which she needed to buy more things. Essentially, she had a job, and while she could live off blue fruits for a time without money—she couldn’t do that forever. Her teeth certainly couldn’t.\nStill. Erin really,\nreally\ndidn’t want to go. She liked people, she really did. But she had a negative reaction to leaving her safe inn and travelling to a far-off city probably full of giant lizards and insects that walked on two feet.\nGlumly, she stared at the three blue fruit cores on her plate. She walked outside and threw them as far as she could. The juices left her hands feeling unpleasantly sticky, but there wasn’t much she could do about it.\n“Guess I’ve gotta go to the stream. Who knew washing your hands was so much work?”\nErin grumbled as she wiped her hand on her jeans. Then she paused. And looked down.\nHer jeans were blue. The blue fruit juice was blue. But against all odds, the blue stain still showed up quite visibly on her clothing. Or rather, the blue fruit\nstains.\nAnd they weren’t just on her pants.\nErin’s shirt was a nice, commercial t-shirt with a lovely company logo on the front and back. Really, she wasn’t that attached to it, but it was perfect to wear when she was just staying at home. It wasn’t\nher\nchoice of clothing.\n…Which was good, because Erin would have cried if she’d inflicted the same damage on a t-shirt she really liked. She gazed down at the blue stains covering her shirt. She poked at the rips and cuts on the sleeves and the burn marks on one side. She lifted the shirt, sniffed once, and gagged.\nFor the first time, Erin felt at her hair. She raised a hand and smelled her breath. She thought about the last time she’d brushed her teeth. Then she tried to shut down her mind.\n“Well, that settles that. I’m off to the city.”",

    "text": "Erin walked through the grass. She wished there was a nice road to follow, but for some reason, no one bothered to pave a road through the empty wilderness. Come to that, she wondered again why anyone would build an inn in the middle of nowhere.\nMaybe there used to be more people in the area. Or maybe there was just an idiot who thought he was breaking into an untapped market. Either way, Erin was grateful for the inn.\n“But why does it have to be so far away from anything?”\nErin walked down the slope. At least there was that. The inn was located on an incline. Not a steep hill, but a really long slope that gradually went down the more she walked. It was nice, until Erin looked back and realized she’d be climbing up all that way again soon.\n“Wow. That’s a big hill.”\nShe stared for a while and kept walking. Relc and Klbkch had called the journey to the city a walk of about twenty minutes.\n“They lied to me.”\nOr maybe they just walked really fast. Erin could actually see the city Klbkch had called Liscor in the distance. It was still small, but given how close it seemed now compared to before and multiplying her velocity by her legs and given energy divided by her willingness to keep walking…\n“Thirty minutes. No; probably an hour. Yeah, that sounds about right.”\nErin sighed. But exercise was good for her, right? It built character. Or something.\n“So, what do I need?”\nShe took a quick inventory check. Her coins were securely packed into the bottom of one pocket. They were heavy. She had her clothes on, which was important, and she looked like…well, like a homeless person. But she had money. So what should she buy with it?\n“Um. Clothing. Right. And soap. And a toothbrush, if they have toothbrushes. And toothpaste…which they probably don’t have. But something. And I need food obviously, more soap, towels, laundry deter—more soap, and a comb.”\nErin walked a few more feet.\n“And a sword. I need a sword. And a shield? And armor? And, uh, anti-Goblin spray? Oh, and books! Tons of books. Maps, history books…can I read any of that? Well, Relc and Klbkch speak English. So that’s weird too. And I need bandages, a sewing needle, someone to teach me how to sew…”\nErin felt at her pocket. The coins jingled. She wished there were more to jingle.\n“And I need to rob a bank.”\nOkay. Erin retraced her thoughts.\n“What’s essential?”\nShe counted off on her fingers.\n“Clothing. Food. Toothbrush. Tooth\npaste.\nAnd a lamp.”\nShe snapped her fingers.\n“Right. A lamp! And a sword.”\nShe felt at her pocket again and heard less of a\njingle\n, more a few bits of metal rubbing together.\n“…Just the lamp.”",

    "text": "“\nFlat grass, flat grass, all I see is flat grass.\n”\nErin sang as she walked. She wasn’t sure if there was a tune, but at least the singing kept her company.\n“\nHorses eat grass, but I’ll pass, so I’ll go to the city fast. Or I’ll die of starvation! And once I’m there, I’ll eat ten pears and—\nhey, is that a Goblin?”\nErin turned her head suddenly, and the small head ducked down. She squinted. Yes, that was definitely a Goblin. It was hiding up on a small hill to her left, but she knew it was still there. Watching her.\nWell. She was being followed. Erin wasn’t sure what to make of that. She looked around, and two more heads disappeared as their owners dove for cover. They didn’t look like they were trying to ambush her, just follow her.\n“Hm.”\nErin bent down and searched the grass. Eventually, she found what she was looking for. She waited until one of the Goblins decided she’d forgotten about them and poked his head up again. Then she turned and shouted.\n“Shoo!”\nErin hurled the rock. It missed the Goblin’s head. And the hill. But the green figure took the hint and disappeared in an instant. Erin sighed to herself.\n“Great. They’re like cockroaches. Evil, giant, green cockroaches. With teeth. And sharp knives. And red eyes.”\nShe wondered what she should do. Then she thought about what she could actually do.\nErin kept walking.\nThe city kept getting larger the further she walked. She felt at some point it should stop getting bigger, but soon the buildings loomed in her vision. They were no skyscrapers, but they were taller than she felt medieval buildings should be. But the city was still far away. So she walked.\nAnd she was being watched. Multiple pairs of eyes stared at the young woman as she walked through the grass. They watched her for signs of weakness, for things that could be exploited. She was watched. Occasionally, she turned around and threw a stone.",

    "text": "When Erin got to the city gates, she stared up for a while.\n“That’s a big wall.”\nIt was a big understatement. The wall was high. And that was high even by wall standards. It was nearly forty feet tall, which Erin had no way of knowing was perfectly normal for a curtain wall. She had no way of knowing it was forty feet tall either. She just thought it was big.\nBut what was unusual about this particular wall, and what Erin did notice, was the way the gate was constructed. It was no iron grating of a portcullis with handy holes to shoot and poke at enemies, but two solid metal doors. Erin wondered why, as the gates looked solid and hard to budge. They were, and for a reason. But she didn’t find out that reason until much later.\nErin approached the gate. There wasn’t really anyone else going through at the moment, so she felt very alone and small as she walked up to them. She stopped when she saw the guard.\nHe was big. He was armored. He was also a Drake, and he had yellow scales rather than green ones. Pale yellow, so Erin was reminded of popcorn. He also had a curved sword, and so it was with trepidation that she approached.\n“…Hi.”\nThe Drake flicked his eyes down towards Erin and then resumed looking off into the distance. He was holding a spear at his side and a metal buckler on his left arm. Since he wasn’t using either to bash her to death, Erin considered this to be a good first start.\n“Um. Nice weather, isn’t it?”\nAgain, the guard glanced at her. Again, he didn’t respond.\n“…Right. It’s just that I’m new here. And I’m Human. Nice to meet you. My name is Erin. I, uh, know another guy who works with you. Relc? And Klb…Klb…the insect guy? So yeah. They know me. I’m no threat. And, uh, I saw some Goblins running around a while back. They’re not here right now, but I felt you should know.”\nThe Drake sighed audibly. And loudly.\n“Go on in, Human. Anyone can enter the city. The gates close at sundown.”\n“Right. Thanks. Uh, have a nice day!”\nErin smiled. He didn’t smile back.\n“I’ll just be going. Now.”\nShe walked past the guard. As she walked through the iron gates, she heard him mutter under his breath.\n“\nHumans.\n”\nErin’s smile froze a bit on her face but she kept walking as if she’d heard nothing. Everyone was grumpy when they had to stand and deal with obnoxious tourists. And besides, he was just a guard. She walked through the imposing gates into the city. And then she had to stop.\nBecause she had entered Liscor. A city of Drakes and the Antinium and even more species she had not yet met, but saw walking and milling about. At least three she could see, all mingling and going about their lives. And now entering—\nOne Human.",

    "text": "The Drake at the eastern gates was still yawning when the young woman hesitated, then walked forwards into the city of Liscor.\nThere were barely any more [Guards] on his section of the wall either; visitors came from the north or, in the winter, the south far more often. Even the western approaches had a few farms, but the only people coming in or out were [Traders] or [Hunters].\nOne had stopped three-dozen paces past the gates. Erin Solstice stopped dead in her tracks because there…\nWas a hyena.\nNo, a dog-person.\nNo, a\nhyena-dog-person.\nHer first instinct was to stop, because she was reminded of a werewolf, a rabid animal—but way bigger than even the largest wolves from her world. It was crouched over half a deer carcass, red with blood, and Erin looked back for the Drake with yellow scales—\nUntil she heard the voice.\n“\n—by the tribes and fur knots.\nAll the lice in Izril! All the lice in Izril and—and Raskghar on these stupid paving stones!”\nIt was a male voice, growling and angry. Then, Erin saw how the person had clearly tripped. The blood from the carcass was due to it tumbling out of someone’s grip. They were getting up, and when she caught sight of their face…Erin’s fears about an animal were unfounded.\nThe furry person had dark brown eyes, with faint pupils almost lost in the deep chestnut color. Their entire body was covered from head to toe in a similar chestnut fur that rippled with every movement. Erin could tell because the figure had on only a kind of hide leggings, and nothing but a weird kind of armband on their right arm.\nShe realized that was one of those things an archer had—an armguard. It went with the recurve bow on their back and quiver at their side. As they straightened, hefting the deer onto their back, Erin realized a few more things.\nThey had features like a hyena, not a dog. There was something…more poofy about their ears, and their face was more angular than most dogs’. A humanoid element that made them look even more expressive than a dog’s face.\nSecond? This—this person was six-foot-\nseven.\nThey towered over Erin, and they had the muscles to match if they were carrying half a\ndeer.\nCome to that—Erin stared at the deer, because she knew deer from her home state of Michigan. This was a\nbig\none, possibly a buck? But the antlers were…glowing. They were an oaken brown at coronet, but turned cherry red at the tips, and the entire antler had a faint bright glow to it.\nThe hyena-person noticed Erin at last as they stood with a groan. They did a visible double-take, then glanced guiltily at the blood on the street.\n“Apologies, Miss. Was I in your way?”\nIt was hard to imagine that—the street was a good two-dozen paces on each side, and there wasn’t anyone else in this particular spot. There was no sidewalk, but the paving stones were mostly flat…except in one spot where some shift had made one jut up treacherously.\nErin backed up instantly, waving her hands.\n“Oh, no! I’m, um—sorry I didn’t help? Sorry you fell?”\nThe person gave her a blank look—then bared all their teeth. Erin froze up, and the figure looked confused. They closed their mouth and curved their lips up.\n“Er…apologies, Miss Human. We don’t see many of your kind around here, yes? A [Trader], a traveller? No need to apologize. [Broader Shoulders] means only I can carry a deer back! Half of one, at any rate. If only I had a bag of holding large enough for an entire deer, eh? I wouldn’t make a Human help me lift one of these!”\nThey laughed and patted an odd bag next to their belt. Erin’s smile grew more desperate.\n“Yes? No?”\nThe person stared at Erin with a quizzical look. A bit of blood dripped onto their shoulder, distracting them, and they cursed again.\n“\nTribes and tribulations.\nExcuse me, Miss. Watch the blood. If that [Guardsman] asks…pretend you never saw me. I’ve got to get this to the [Butchers] before the Acid Flies are all over.”\n“The…”\nThis was so fascinating, but the figure was already striding off, and Erin, dumbfounded, had to catch her breath a second. And by that point, she realized that this was a city of more than just ant people and Drakes.\nErin walked down the first street, and then she began seeing crowds. In fact…that furry fellow was one of\nthousands.\nHundreds she could see in any given moment, which made her assume this city was home to at least tens of thousands.\nDrakes, Relc called his people. Not lizards—\nDrakes.\nThey had scales of every color, almost always one color with perhaps some speckling of other scales at most, like freckles. But most had only one dominant scale color.\nGreen or blue were the majority, but Erin saw a Drake with orange scales talking to another who was laughing and…gossiping? That was what it looked like as she held a claw in front of her mouth, whispering loudly to a group seated at a table. She had bright yellow scales and…a kind of tavern girl’s outfit on.\nA medieval dress. But, done in a modern\nstyle\nif that made sense. With cleaner and far higher-quality fabric than Erin would have expected of the actual medieval ages. Like someone in a renaissance fair, actually. But…\nThe more Erin looked at the various types of clothing, she realized it wasn’t a one-to-one comparison with her world. The dyes were less vibrant and the lack of machine-printing meant that there were no logos, but a lot of fine embroidery. She saw a sigil of a city in the form of a badge on a passing Drake’s uniform and could tell it was an emblem because of the delicate gold thread surrounding the city with a sword and axe hovering over it.\nOn another hyena woman’s shirt was a silver fang embroidered in thread. And the lack of dyes also resulted in a more natural feel to the attire around her. Instead of neon-green, the brightest colors were a fine red shirt on one of the furred men, or plain white cotton on a very light dress under a thin, pale-blue outer layer.\nThe people here wore clothing bright and colorful enough that, at a glance, you might not realize how different it was. Erin’s t-shirt and jeans were still odd, but not uniquely so. If anything, it was being a Human that made her stand out.\nBecause these people were\npeople\n, even if they weren’t Human\n.\nThey were walking to work, talking, avoiding the fellow with the half a deer carcass on their shoulder—Drakes and the furry people.\nNo Humans. And no ant-people that Erin could see on this crowded street. The Drakes seemed to be the majority, but there was a strong minority of the…what?\nErin had no idea what to call them, but they were a tall lot, weren’t they? The Drakes varied in height roughly around Human standards, but the furry folk seemed to be taller on average. Bigger, too. There were male and female ones—Erin could tell despite the fur. And the female ones tended to have breastbands at the minimum.\nA lot of the furry folk wore light clothing. Literally just a kilt or a kind of exceptionally loose pair of pants. A…toga? An actual\ntoga\n, yes! It must have been hot, despite the cool weather, for anyone with that much fur.\nBy contrast, the Drakes also had togas and fairly loose clothing, but some were dressed head-to-toe. Like the Drake with bright yellow scales whispering to some people at—an outdoor café?\nShe had a platter of drinks and some bowls on the tray, but she’d stopped to whisper to a gaggle of other Drakes.\n“\n—broke up again.\nHawk can’t keep a girlfriend for more than a month, Courier and gold or not. It’s his obsession with\nvegetables.\n”\n“You sure it’s not him being…him, Drassi?”\n“Oh, hush. He’s fine. He’s more Drake than you are. I’m just saying—”\nThe barmaid, or whomever she was, jumped guiltily as an angry Drake with black scales—aside from some grey-white ones around his head—came out, his voice raised. He had a smock, and he looked managerial. In fact, Erin realized she was witnessing a common sight from her world.\n“Drassi! This is the\neleventh\ntime this week! I’ve told you again and again,\nstop gossiping.\nI don’t care what your class is—enough. You’re friendly, but you’re also fired.”\n“What? But I can work harder! Come on, Mister Drells…”\nThe Drake protested as her friends coughed and tried not to be there. Erin’s eyes boggled at the sight of someone losing gainful employment before her eyes—and if that didn’t make this a city like home, she didn’t know what did.\nThe city. Now that she was done staring at the people, Erin realized this city was…well,\nstone.\nStreets? Stone. Walls? Stone. Not concrete or asphalt, but cobblestones stuck together with some version of cement. Not incorporating any faux-stone cladding. Actual, legitimately hewn stone that sometimes bore chisel marks.\nIt reminded her of one of those European cities, the older ones. A lot of the buildings were wooden, and most had at least two stories. There was even a sidewalk, but no cars, obviously. Nor were there any traffic lights or modern electronics in sight.\nErin saw wood shutters thrown open, a few people on outdoor balconies watering pots of flowers, and someone hanging clothes up to dry—but thankfully no privy pots being thrown into the streets.\nIn fact, she realized that the street not only had a sidewalk, but very familiar openings into…a sewer? The street looked fairly clean, and Erin was so busy staring that she didn’t hear the angry person shouting at her until she looked up and saw a\nwagon\nrolling towards her.\n“\nGet out of the way, you idiot!\n”\nErin ran for the side with a squeak of alarm. The driver on the wagon, another Drake, slowed the pair of ponies that stared at Erin almost accusatorially as the Drake—female?—managed to stop her vehicle.\n“Are you blind? Stay on the sidewalk! I nearly ran you over!”\n“I’m sorry!”\nErin called back as people turned to stare at her. The fired [Barmaid] perked up the instant she saw Erin.\n“A Human? We haven’t seen one of them in…I wonder if another trade caravan’s getting here?”\nThe [Driver] paid no attention. She pointed at the huge wagon, and Erin realized those were the vehicles of choice. From footcarts to gigantic wagons larger than cars, loaded with goods.\n“Sorry?\nSorry?\nWhen this wheel runs over your foot, no healing potion in the world is going to get it back. Do you think I want that on my conscience?”\n“S-sorry. I just didn’t see—”\nThe Drake glowered, but she flapped the reins, moving onwards.\n“I don’t have time for this. I’ve got a delivery to run. Sidewalk! Use it!”\nErin was running afoul of everyone. Subdued, Erin scurried to the side of the street—and got into trouble again. Because she wanted to stop and stare, and this was a crowded city. Hundreds of people were all about, and they didn’t much like someone who stood still. Or Humans in general, it seemed.\nErin had come to a halt in front of a large building with writing on top. A lovely, wide sign…that she couldn’t read.\nThe language was different here.\nExactly like the other words on the sign. It said, um…well, she had no idea, but there were two words and what looked like an apostrophe. But the real clue was what looked like a crystal ball and a magic wand with glowy bits. Some kind of symbol.\nMagic?\nThen Erin got in trouble again with the locals.\n“Excuse me, Miss. Are you waiting in line for…?”\n“One side, Human! Stop blocking the way!”\nShe jumped out of the way, and some impatient citizens strode into the building, which was getting good traffic in and out. Erin looked around. Every head turned to stare at her, and she heard that refrain again.\n“Humans.”\n“Excuse me—um—what’s this building? I can’t read…”\nErin looked from person to person, and one stopped to talk to her. That friendly yellow-scaled Drake had been drooping along, head hung low after being fired. But this novelty made her smile come back with an eager vengeance.\n“What, the Mage’s Guild? You can’t read, Miss Human?\nRight,\nyou don’t read Drake script. Are you looking for the Mage’s Guild? Runner’s Guild? Adventurer’s Guild? An inn to stay in? Stables? The Watch, maybe? I’m Drassi.”\nThe words broke over Erin like a rushing wave. The young woman lifted her hands.\n“No! I mean, I’m just looking around. Nice to meet…I’m just looking for a—a store!”\nThe Drake gave her a bright smile. With too many teeth. She bared all her needle-sharp teeth, and Erin gulped.\n“What kind of store?”\n“Uh—I—just looking, thanks!”\nErin fled, feeling embarrassed and awkward. The Drake scratched at her neck spines as Erin hurried off.\nIf she kept moving, she could be part of the crowd. After a while, Erin was less flustered. She walked down the street and became, well, part of the city’s traffic. That allowed her to observe.\nThis city is huge!\nAt least, she thought so. There were so many people she wondered how many lived here. Tens of thousands? Hundreds, probably. And all packed into the walls, not spread out.\nHence, there were no real suburbs, just residential streets with four stories of buildings next to or above shops. Erin saw the fellow who’d killed that odd deer again, depositing his kill with the [Butcher]. He was having a hard time.\n“You just gave me a damned Corusdeer. Half of one.”\n“Yes. And?”\nThe man had his arms folded as the Drake harangued him.\n“\nWhere’s the other half?\nYou didn’t\nskin\nit first? You’ve ruined the hide—and there’s dirt on this part! Did you drag it back?”\nThe other figure growled.\n“I dropped it once, okay? It’s not bad, no! And as for cutting it in half—I thought I saw a Shield Spider nest near me. They would have been over the kill—and me—in minutes. The hide’s fine. You can make boots out of what’s here. How much for it all?”\n“Typical. You go for the top half because the antlers are worth money to the [Alchemists]. Nevermind the intestines being good for sausage or all the organs like the liver and—stop growling at me. I know, Shield Spiders. Damn it. Alright…let me check the quality of the meat. Give me a few minutes. And get a bucket of water and wash yourself off. You’re going to attract Acid Flies.”\nA butcher’s. Or was it a [Butcher]? Erin saw more of that oddly cursive writing on storefronts, helpful sign posts…she guessed that this city would be easy to navigate. If she could read.\nOddly, everyone spoke the same. The furry fellow had a bit of a rolling ‘r’ to his voice and a growling tone, just like the Drakes elongated their ‘s’ and ‘l’ sounds, but they were speaking perfect English.\nAs for the butcher’s shop, what made Erin stare was the\nglass\nwindow. It had glass! It was the first glass she’d seen, and it astonished her because she hadn’t expected to see any in what she took to be a medieval world before they had access to the stuff in bulk. Wait, didn’t churches back then have glass? The point was she didn’t expect to see it in widespread use.\nBut glass was visible in a few buildings, and the more she looked, the more she noticed it. It wasn’t ubiquitous, but it was a window here, a pair of spectacles there—and one huge building with tons of people entering and exiting had a wand and a crystal ball icon over the front.\nAnd then she wandered into an open plaza, and her mouth dropped. There were benches, even a park with trees and a playground over there! In this city! In fact, rising at one end of this plaza was a distinctly governmental building. It had large pillars, an open frontage that had less traffic, but a very familiar-looking sigil. The same one on Relc’s badge.\n“That must be city hall or something. And the place with the wand—was that a magic shop…do they teach magic there? Do they sell wands? Wow.\nWow.\nAnd I just need to find…a regular people shop.”\nShe was still overwhelmed, but Erin could catch her breath in the plaza with no one growling at her to keep moving. She took one breath, then another, then tried not to hyperventilate.\n“Okay. Okay. I was lost before. I can do this.”",

    "text": "She had, in fact, been lost in a big city before. The key was noting where the foot-traffic was going. Erin guessed that led to places people shopped or did…things at. She kept monologuing; a lot of people were standing around or watching the children play. Again, Erin saw no little ant-people like Klbkch.\n“What do I do if I get super-lost? Remember that street name. Squiggly line…got it. And if I can’t remember it or find my way back? Amsterdam, chess tournament. Start crying and ask where mom is…No, wait, I’m older now. Uh—uh—”\nShe heard a loud\nsnorting\nsound from the side. Erin turned, and three dozen paces away, another furry person covered their mouth. They were laughing—at her.\n“Sorry! We overheard, yes?”\nThey were a duo, male and female, watching a little boy run around on all fours. He was either naked or clothing didn’t matter with all his fur on. Erin turned beet red as she realized the parents had…heard her? She hurried off towards the most crowded street. Just try to blend in.\n…After five minutes of walking, Erin realized she was lost again. She stared hopefully at another building with one of those broad frontages. Then she looked around. She peeked through a window and saw someone, another Drake, idly sitting at a wooden counter, head propped on one chin. Erin took a deep breath.\nThen she went inside.",

    "text": "“Uh, is this a store?”\nEvery head in the Adventurer’s Guild in Liscor turned at the voice. Grizzled Drake warriors sporting scars from their heads to their tails, inhumanly tall furry people, most carrying bows, and several people who looked like mages, wearing robes or carrying staves, appraised the speaker who had just walked into the building.\nA small Human. Possibly female. She stopped uncertainly the moment she noticed all the armor.\nUnlike outside, the people in this building were not civilians. Civilians didn’t\nclank\nwhen they moved or sat down. These people, adventurers, wore armor, even in the morning, and they carried no daggers or shortswords, but had battleaxes strapped to their backs, longbows resting against the walls.\nThe figures at tables or clustered around a billboard appraised Erin for one heart-stopping second, then their eyes shifted away in disinterest. After a few seconds, Erin’s heart started beating again. She decided that this was\ndefinitely\nnot the shop she was looking for. She almost turned and ran again when a voice rang out.\n“Ah, hello? We can help you over here.”\nA voice called to Erin across the low murmuring. She saw a green-scaled Drake, her scales as fair as light grass under sunlight, waving at her from behind a counter. She looked faintly bored, but peered at Erin with less instant hostility than most people in this foreign city.\nShe was much smaller and had thinner limbs than Relc. Erin guessed she was female on the basis of her voice. The dress was also a big clue: light blue and flowed like running water, two straps along her shoulders providing support.\nHesitantly, Erin made her way over to the counter. The female receptionist gave her a close-lipped smile. She scrutinized Erin up and down and then launched into a rehearsed, if tired, spiel.\n“Good day, Miss. How can we help you today? Do you have a bounty or request to post? Or are you registering?”\n“Registering? Quest? Oh no, I’m not here for…uh, anything. I just thought this might be a store, so I…”\n“Oh, I see! No worries, Miss Human. You’re just in the wrong spot, but I can give you directions if you’d like.”\nThe receptionist smiled again. And because she didn’t seem hostile or annoyed, this time Erin smiled back.\n“Oops, sorry. Uh, where am I?”\nThe Drake chuckled as if it weren’t obvious.\n“This is the Adventurer’s Guild. That lot didn’t tip you off?”\nShe nodded to the armed people lounging around. Erin blinked and her eyes went wide.\n“The Adventurer’s Guild?”\n“Didn’t they have one back in your city?”\nThe Drake raised her brows in frank disbelief. Erin stared around the room with renewed interest. Now that she wasn’t being pierced by a thousand glares, she could take in the building properly. It was a large place, and, at first, Erin thought she’d walked into an inn. Or a bar. But now that she knew what she was looking at, the receptionist behind the counter made a lot of sense.\n“N—I mean, I’ve never been in one before.”\nShe wondered if that was a stupid thing to say, but the Drake just flashed her another big smile, reassuring.\n“That’s quite alright. Not everyone needs to use an Adventurer’s Guild. Most never will, hopefully. If you’ve never needed any services, let me give you the basic explanation. Here you can let the Guild know about dangerous monsters in your area, post quests and offer rewards, or if you’re an adventurer yourself, you can go look at assignments or receive your reward.”\nThe receptionist pointed to a large wooden board nailed up against one wall. It had quite a lot of parchment stuck to the wood, and several large and burly adventurers were gathered around it, talking amongst themselves.\n“Wow.”\nErin studied the adventurers. They were all wearing armor, although the quality and amount varied from person to person. Most of the Drakes seemed content to wear only armguards or the occasional helmet without much chest armor, but several of the large hairy dog-hyena-people were wearing chainmail, and in one case, real plate armor.\nThat wasn’t all, of course. Some adventurers weren’t wearing any armor at all. But they were all armed. Erin spotted several Drakes wearing light robes and carrying staves or daggers at their belts. One even looked like they were wearing armor made out of some dark, glossy material. It didn’t look comfortable, but they definitely looked ready for a fight. Erin whispered as she saw one of the Drakes flick a claw and produce a few sparks, to the amusement of her companions.\n“Real mages. That is so cool.”\n“…Miss? Excuse me, Miss?”\nErin looked around. She realized the receptionist had been trying to get her attention for some time now.\n“Oh, I’m really sorry. What was that you were saying?”\n“Are you a traveller, Miss? Or maybe…an adventurer? Are you here to register?”\nThe look the she-Drake gave her said this wasn’t much of a possibility. But she was very friendly, and Erin tried to explain.\n“Oh no. I’m, uh, an innkeeper. I guess. Or maybe a wanderer? Actually, I’m just new around here.”\nThe receptionist looked interested. She sat up a bit and added a different emphasis to the class than Erin had.\n“An [Innkeeper], is it? Are you opening up a business here? Humans almost never move to Liscor. I’m Selys, by the way. I should have said so from the start. My apologies.”\nSelys offered Erin a hand. It was such a Human gesture Erin had to smile as she shook her hand. It felt weird touching the cool scales, but not unpleasant. She was almost worried about the claws, but she didn’t even feel a prick as Selys returned the smile, again, without teeth.\n“I’m Erin. Erin Solstice. And no, I’m not, uh, innkeeping here. I live outside the city. In an inn a ways away. I guess. I just came here, because I needed to go shopping. Badly.”\nShe indicated her ripped and stained clothing. Selys eyed that with a slow nod.\n“Well, I can’t leave the desk, but I can give you some directions. No wonder you were lost—you can’t read any of the signs, can you? Your people normally stick to the north; Esthelm’s as far as most get. What brings you out so far? Oh, and what are you looking for?”\n“Um. A teleportation spell got me here? And I need food. Flour, oil, butter, salt…that kind of thing. And I need clothing. Lots of clothing. And toothpaste!”\nSelys gave Erin a longer look, as if trying to see whether Erin was joking or not. She replied after a moment.\n“Well, if it’s food and general supplies you’re looking for, try the market two streets down from here. To get to it, just take a left as you walk out of here and then turn right, and you’ll be there in no time. They’d also have some clothes there, but I’m not sure if they have any made for Humans. What kind of teleportation spell did that? You mean,\npeople\nteleportation? Gone wrong? That would be a huge scandal. Anyways, the market will have everything you need.”\n“Oh, that’s great. Thank you so much. About how I got here—I don’t know if it was an accident or me—\nmaybe\nteleportation! But um. Right now I’m just trying to get by. So the market is two streets down and left and right…?”\nErin had already forgotten the directions. Selys repeated them, then mouthed what Erin had said.\n‘Maybe teleportation’?\nErin was too flustered to notice. She could memorize most of what she needed pretty easily, but when she was nervous, things slipped. She wished she had her smartphone or Google Maps. A map would be useless since she had never learned how to read them.\n“I’m also looking for a place to get some other supplies. I don’t suppose you know where—”\nA large, hairy hand grabbed Erin by the shoulder and pulled her around.\n“Huh?”\nErin was looking at a wall of brown hair. She was sure that wasn’t there a minute ago. She looked up.\nA hyena’s face stared down at her. Or rather, a hyena’s face on a humanoid body covered in fur. It was one of the adventurers in the guild and it—he—didn’t look happy.\nBut he wasn’t saying anything. Rather, he was\nlooming\n. Erin could tell it was looming by the way he stood and the way she felt like an ant. She didn’t know why he was angry at her. Maybe he just wanted to pick on someone. She opened her mouth and tried diplomacy.\n“Um. Hi. Are you—are you a wolf-person?”\nIt was definitely the wrong thing to say. The pissed-off look on the hairy hyena-guy’s face only got worse. He growled at her in a rumbling voice that sounded like…well, what Erin imagined a dog would sound like if it could talk.\n“Do I\nlook\nlike a Wolf Beastkin?”\n“N-no?”\nErin backed up a step and found the counter was right behind her. She looked over her shoulder and saw Selys gazing at her worriedly, but the receptionist didn’t come to her aid.\nThe not-werewolf leaned over and growled in her face.\n“I’m a\nGnoll.\n”\nHis breath was\nterrible.\nErin felt weak at the knees just smelling it.\n“Right. I’m very sorry about that. Um. Can I help you?”\n“You’re in my way. This is for\nadventurers\n.”\n“Right. Sorry. Sorry about that.”\nErin stepped to one side so he could get to Selys. He didn’t move forward, though. Instead he just glared some more. A few more seconds of glaring made Erin stutter.\n“Is—is there something else you want?”\nThe Gnoll twisted his neck and\ncracked\nit. It sounded like firecrackers going off and scared the hell out of Erin.\n“I don’t like Humans. They smell.\nYou\nsmell like garbage. Like rancid oil and flames and things that turn my stomach. And Goblins and dust and mold.”\nErin stepped away again, but the angry Gnoll just followed her. She knew she was being watched by the other adventurers in the room now. But, like Selys, they seemed content to watch the Human-bullying without making a move.\n“R-really? I can’t smell anything.”\n“That’s because Humans can’t smell\nanything.\n”\nThe comment came from behind Erin, but she was too scared to turn around. It had the same growling quality to the voice though, so she was sure it was another Gnoll.\n“Right. Well. I’m sorry about that.”\nErin tried to sidestep the Gnoll, but he blocked her way.\n“I don’t want Humans in here. You don’t belong.”\n“Hold on, now. She’s just lost.”\nAt last, Selys came to Erin’s aid. The female Drake leaned over the counter and called out to the Gnoll. Now, Erin realized he had a bag of dripping something. There was a long, bug-like leg sticking out of it, he was covered in green blood—and some red—and he looked tired and angry.\n“If you’ve got a bounty—Shield Spiders—I’ll process it now. But this Human was just asking directions. You can’t just kick someone out who—”\nHe looked at her and\nsnarled\n. Selys flinched and shut up.\nAcross the room, Erin saw the Drakes in the room stir. One of them\nhissed\nsoftly.\nThe Gnoll glared at the Drakes, and they glared right back. One of his hands twitched towards the sword at his side, but he didn’t make any move to grab it. Still, the tension was so thick that Erin was sure if a Gnoll or Drake moved the room would explode.\nErin was wondering whether she should run when the Gnoll broke off the staring contest and swung around to her.\n“You. You’re stinking up this place with dirt and filth. I can\nsmell\nthe things you’ve rolled in. You haven’t washed in—\ndead gods.\nI’m covered in Shield Spider guts and you smell worse! Take a bath before you come back here.”\nHe jabbed at Erin’s stained shirt with one pointed claw. She jumped back nervously from the long, filthy nails.\n“Oh. Yeah. Um, I’m really sorry about that. It’s just that I’ve been sort of fending for myself, and I didn’t have a change of clothes so—”\nThe Gnoll leaned forward. Erin could see the individual whiskers protruding out of his snout. She could smell his rancid breath. But she was mainly focused on his jagged teeth.\n“\nBegone.\n”\nErin hesitated. She cast one glance towards Selys, but the receptionist wouldn’t meet her eyes.\nThe Gnoll\ngrowled,\nand Erin backed up. He herded her towards the door, and once she was out, he\nslammed\nit shut behind her. The last thing she saw was Selys waving at her guiltily.\nThat was the first building Erin was kicked out of in her visit to the city. It wasn’t her last. Not by a long shot.\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "Erin walked through the city, feeling the unwelcome sun warming the back of her neck. She was hot, sweaty, and tired. But most of all, she was anxious. It was a terrible, biting pain in her stomach that refused to leave her no matter how much she tried to relax. Because she couldn’t.\nShe was lost. Not just geographically, but in every sense. Right now, she was making her way to the market Selys had told her about. But she was still lost.\nShe didn’t belong to this city. The people had been a mix of unfriendly or—well, not all of them had been bad, like Selys and that first Drake, but Erin was the outsider, and it wasn’t a pleasant feeling. She tried to take her mind off things by admiring the city.\nIt really was like an older city. True, there was a lot more roundness in the architecture of the buildings—a lot of gently sloping roofs and open rooftops rather than the angular buildings Erin was used to. Stone and wood and yes, glass, but it felt to Erin like one of the older cities of Europe—hallmarks of older architecture without the steel or metal that was everywhere in a modern metropolis.\nIt was pleasant to stare at this foreign architecture and feel like a traveller to some part of Earth she had never experienced before. The people were what really got to her.\nThey weren’t Human. No matter how long Erin stayed in the city and walked its streets, she couldn’t get over that. Every face she saw in the crowd was inhuman, and the majority of them were Drakes. There was the occasional Gnoll or other furry face in the lot, but they were mostly reptilian.\nAll kinds of reptilian, too. Long snouts, delicate spines on the neck, elongated neck, big eyes, slitted eyes, stub snouts. They all had very large teeth, though. Only rarely did Erin glimpse a walking ant man—or ant woman, she couldn’t tell—walking by.\nKlbkch’s people were few and far between. Erin saw them scurrying along, sometimes in groups, other times by themselves, mostly with tools in hand, heads down, clearly on a mission. People avoided them almost as much as they avoided her, but it really said something that a Human was the person people stared at, even more than insect-folk. It was also adding to Erin’s anxiety.\nShe wished they’d stop looking at her. That was the one thing that made walking through this city so hard. While she was staring at the exotic sights and people, they were staring right back. And it seemed that they didn’t like what they saw.\nErin tried to walk quickly down the street. That way she’d avoid offending anyone else. She didn’t have a good record at the moment.\n“Kicked out of three shops. And two homes.\nAnd\nthen\nthe Adventurer’s Guild.”\nTo be fair, some of them\nlooked\nlike shops. Why no one put up any signs so people could tell the difference was beyond Erin.\n“Well, there are signs. I just can’t read them.”\nIt was a funny thing. Erin could\nspeak\nthe exact same language as Relc and Klbkch, but for some reason, she couldn’t read anything they wrote. It was probably because…of magic.\n“Magic. Either that or they’re all bilingual. Or trilingual. Or something.”\nA Drake walking the opposite way down the street gave her an odd look. Erin shut up. Her habit of talking to herself was making her weirder than normal.\nStill, that alone didn’t explain why it seemed like the entire city hated her. True, she kept walking into places and asking where she was, but that was…okay, that was really annoying. But she was just as unfavorably received on the street, it seemed.\n“Move it, Human.”\n“Out of the way, smooth skin.”\n“Watch it, fleshbag.”\nActually, no one had ever said that last one to her. Or the second one, either. Or the first, in point of fact. They didn’t say anything at all, really. Almost all of the Drakes stared at her, while the Gnolls and other furry people walked as far away from her as possible. But they all watched her constantly.\nSome glanced out of the corner of their eyes. Others were less discreet and openly stared at her. Erin saw a few small Drake-children pointing at her and felt out of place. In a sea of scales and fur, she was the only Human. She felt so alone it hurt.\nErin turned right and found herself on another kind of street. This one was wider, had cobblestone paving, and a lot of wooden stalls. It was a market.\n“Finally.”\nErin sighed with relief and walked forward. She’d finally reached her destination, and it had only taken her…an hour. Possibly two.\nAnd better luck, Erin seemed to be in the section selling food. Tons of shopkeepers stood or sat in their shaded stalls displaying bins full of food. Here was a Drake selling weird blue-leaved plants that looked like oversized white carrots…or dead maggots. There was another Drake cutting meat for a waiting customer as flies buzzed around his stall. And there was—\nA Gnoll.\nErin passed by a larger stall than most, tended to by a tall Gnoll, although they were all tall in her eyes. This one seemed to be selling a lot of stuff, and not just food. Erin was tempted to stop and browse, but the Gnoll shopkeeper complicated things. She was dithering when the Gnoll spotted her and roared out above the general hubbub.\n“You, Human! If you’re looking for a bargain, shop here!”\nErin’s heart jumped. Gnolls were, like Relc,\nloud\n. And her voice had put every eye back on Erin.\nYet, the Gnoll woman had bared all her teeth then caught herself, closed her mouth in a tight-lipped smile, and beckoned Erin over. She wore a kind of animal hide sarong, albeit lined with some soft cloth on the inside, a breastband of the same material, and little else. Mostly because her shop had a thin canopy that meant she got the most of the sun, standing or sitting in it all day.\nHer fur was spotted with jet black dots, but the rest of it was russet brown and, Erin thought, neatly combed or maintained. She was at least six-foot-something, and her smile was direct, even if her eyes were slightly calculating. But she did smile without a hint of anger or annoyance, and she’d called to Erin. So the young woman hesitated and then walked over to the stall.\nAs she approached, the Gnoll’s nose wrinkled and she waved a paw in front of her face. Erin’s heart sank, but the Gnoll made no comment.\n“Well, what are you seeking?”\nThe Gnoll looked intently at Erin. She looked angry, or maybe Gnolls always sounded brisk and impatient.\n“Oh, um. I’m just looking.”\n“Can I get you anything? What are you looking for?”\n“I’m—I’ll just look around if that’s okay.”\n“I…could help you find what you want. Krshia’s Silverfang Goods. Do you have anything you want or—?”\nIt was entirely reasonable, but Erin began sweating at once. She backed away a step.\n“No, I’ll just wander around and—look. Thank you.”\nErin edged back from the Gnoll’s shop. She really didn’t want to be chased out of the market yet.\n“Hrmf. Suit yourself.”\nThe Gnoll looked away. She was definitely annoyed now, even if she hadn’t been before. Erin backed away and looked towards the next stall.\nThis one looked equally promising. And better yet, it was tended to by a Drake. Which wasn’t that much better, true, but at least he wasn’t wrinkling his nose. Maybe because he wasn’t looking at her.\nErin approached the stall carefully and gazed at the many items on display.\nLet’s see.\nThere were lots of bags piled up neatly, and in front of them there were little bins of their contents on display. That was good since Erin couldn’t read any of the words on the store signs.\nBut there! She saw flour, salt, and even sugar on display along with other dried goods. The Drake was selling dried sausages that hung from hooks at the top of his little shop, dried onions and garlic in baskets, and a number of dried roots and spices in one corner of the shop.\n“Hi. Is this a food shop?”\nThe Drake looked over at her.\n“What does it look like, Human?”\nErin winced internally at the tone of his voice. But he wasn’t wrinkling his nose still or glaring. He just looked annoyed.\n“Oh, I’m looking for food. Lots of it.”\nShe heard a very loud and angry\nsnort\ncome from the Gnoll shopkeeper. She winced, externally this time.\n“What you see is what I have.”\nThe Drake indicated his goods with a wave of one claw. That sounded like an invitation to Erin, so she stepped inside the stall and peered around. Flour was what she was most interested in. With that and a bit of oil, salt, etcetera, she could make bread, pasta, and other filling things. It was the best place to start. She bent down to examine the flour—\n“No touching the food with your filthy hands unless you’re buying!”\nThe Drake’s voice made Erin jump away. She caught herself before she fell backwards. He was glaring at her.\n“Don’t touch. You’ll stink it up with your Human smell.”\n“Sorry. Sorry.”\nErin backed away from the goods on display, hands raised. She guessed she really\ndid\nsmell.\nThe shopkeeper directed his full and unhappy attention towards her.\n“What do you want? Name it and I’ll fetch it for you.”\n“Oh, okay.”\nErin floundered.\n“Um. I’m looking for a few things, actually. Uh, do you have any butter?”\n“It’s right there on the sign.”\nThe Drake tapped the little piece of paper pinned to the stall. Erin looked at it desperately, but just saw squiggles and lines in all the wrong places.\n“Uh. I can’t read that. Sorry.”\nHe\nhissed\nsoftly in annoyance. Erin winced again.\n“But I’d like some. Butter, that is.”\nHe slowly and grudgingly turned and pulled out a small pot with a small cork for a lid.\n“Oh. Great.”\nErin wasn’t sure if she should ask to see how much butter was inside. She wanted to hold the little pot too, but the shopkeeper’s expression also vetoed that idea.\n“And, uh, I’d like some oil too. Do you have another jar…?”\nThe Drake sighed loudly in annoyance.\n“I don’t have all day to play fetch for you, Human. Just tell me what you want to buy first.”\n“Okay.”\nHe wasn’t throwing things or chasing her away, so that was as good as it was going to get, Erin guessed. She took a deep breath and rattled off whatever she could remember she needed.\n“I’m looking for some flour, salt, butter, oil, and sugar. Oh! And yeast. I’ll need yeast too. If you have it.”\nThe Drake didn’t move.\n“Anything else?”\nErin looked around quickly.\n“Um. Those sausages. How much do they cost?”\nErin pointed to the sausages hanging from a hook. They looked mouthwateringly plump. She had the idea she could fry some up with the pasta. Just the thought was making her stomach rumble.\nThe Drake’s eyes flicked over to them.\n“How many?”\nErin rummaged in her pocket and pulled out her precious coins. She saw the Drake’s eyes widen just a fraction as she showed him the mix of silver and bronze and two gold coins.\n“Well, if I’ve got enough, I’d like to buy a few of those. And some onions.”\nThere weren’t many vegetables here. Only some garlic and shriveled roots in one bin. But she could always go to the Gnoll and ask—well, maybe not the Gnoll. But there were probably other shops that sold produce.\nThe Drake eyed the coins in her hand and flicked his eyes up to her. Erin felt like she was being assessed, and she didn’t enjoy the feeling. For all she was a paying customer, he still looked like he was angry at her for some reason.\nAt last the shopkeeper seemed to come to a decision. He flicked his tongue out of his mouth and glared at her.\n“Two gold coins. Eight silver. That will buy you a bag of flour, oil, butter, four sausages, two onions, and a bag of sugar, salt, and yeast.”\nErin hesitated. She eyed the meaningless symbols on the little plaque again. The Gnoll shopkeeper to Erin’s left seemed to be having a breathing problem. She was choking on the air. Erin glanced to the side.\n“Are—are you sure that’s the price? I mean, it sounds like a lot—”\n“Are you calling me a\nliar\n?”\nThe Drake raised his voice angrily. Erin could see other customers and shopkeepers looking around.\n“No, no! I was just saying that—”\n“Typical Humans. Walking in here, stinking up the market, and insulting any non-Humans you find. You should be grateful the Guard doesn’t run you out of the city! First that damn [Necromancer] comes here, and now this smelly one that can’t even\nread.\n”\n“\nLism!\n”\nThe Gnoll woman hissed, but he ignored her. The Drake seemed to be inflating with rage. Erin didn’t know what she’d done to set him off—besides the smell—but she tried to be diplomatic.\n“Look, I was just asking about the price.”\n“I just gave you my price. Take it or leave it.”\n“But can we negotiate? I mean, how about two gold coins? What’s the price of the flour? If I pay you—”\nThe Drake shopkeeper let out a strangled hissing sound.\n“Human, I have a business to run and a store to manage! Either pay me my price or be gone. You won’t find a better offer in this market.”\nLooking around, Erin guessed that was true. She was getting unfriendly looks from the other shopkeepers down the street, especially the Gnoll whose wares she’d walked by.\n“Okay. I’ll buy it all.”\nShe placed the gold and silver coins on the counter since he wasn’t holding his hand out. He eyed the coins, sniffed once, and swept them away.\n“Here. Your food. Take it.”\nThe shopkeeper began grabbing items and slamming them down on the counter. He shoved them all together in a huge untidy pile and threw a few dented copper coins down too. Some rolled onto the ground.\nErin hesitated, but the shopkeeper’s scaly back was already expressively turned away. She heard what sounded like hissing laughter and muttered comments from behind her and turned red.\nSlowly, Erin bent down and began picking up the fallen copper coins. She tried to avoid looking at anyone or anything.\nWhen she finally stood up, the shopkeeper was looking at her expressionlessly. He flicked one claw towards her.\n“If you’re done grubbing in the dirt, I have more customers to serve.”\nErin knew her face was red. Her eyes were burning, but she was determined not to do anything else. She took a deep breath and tried to steady her voice as much as possible. Still, it wobbled a bit as she said one last thing.\n“…Can I buy a bag?”",

    "text": "Erin sat in the shade of one of the buildings and stared silently at the four silver coins in her hand, which was all she had left after buying a large cloth bag and the food. It wasn’t so bad. She still had\nsome\nmoney, and she’d bought enough food for now. It was just enough for…well, she didn’t know. But it certainly wasn’t enough for a lantern, much less a sword. She doubted it was even enough for her clothes.\nShe’d started out with two gold coins and a full handful of silver and copper ones. And in an instant, they’d been spent. True, she’d bought a lot of food. Stuff like sugar was expensive, right? Especially in a place that wasn’t modern like this. It was just…she couldn’t help but feel it was a mistake.\nShe hadn’t seen any other shoppers trade gold coins for what they’d bought. Not one and especially not that much for some food. She had a bad feeling in the pit of her stomach. She thought—\nNo. She\nknew\nshe’d been ripped off.\nAnd it hurt. It really did. Erin wanted to go back there and punch the Drake shopkeeper in the face, but she had a pretty good idea of what would happen if she did. Plus, he could probably eat her face if she tried.\nSo. Erin sat and stared at her hand. Four silver coins.\nShe could still go shopping with that much money. She could find another market, find another shop, and…\nAnd do what? She didn’t know how much money things cost, and she didn’t know how to buy clothes for herself.\nEveryone in this city wore clothing, but the definition of that really varied. Some of the male Gnolls wore extremely exposed clothing, sometimes leaving their chests completely bare save for a light cloak, while the female ones usually had more on. Still, even that was varied because it seemed showing skin—or rather, scales—was the fashion around here. Only the Drakes seemed to adhere to a dress code she was used to.\nIt was one of the hidden truths of the world. Money was useless if you had no idea what to spend it on and everyone ripped you off.\nEverything would be so much simpler if she could read. Was that too much to ask?\nErin put her head on her arm and closed her eyes for a moment. Her head jerked up, and she nearly smacked it against the building behind her as she realized something.\nShe couldn’t read. But she knew people who could.\nRelc. Or Klbkch. Either one of them would know all about clothing and money and stuff like that.\nErin stood up. She pocketed her silver coins and wished she’d thought of this\nbefore\nshe’d lost all her money. But maybe four silver coins was a lot of money? She’d have to ask. And they’d help her, surely. Because that’s what guardsmen did, right? Just like how police officers were so willing to help anyone who came to them with a problem.\nErin pushed that thought out of her head. Guardsmen were not police officers. They were allowed to kill people without due process, for one thing. But Relc liked her pasta, and he and Klbkch had been kind to her. Now all she had to do was find the guardhouse without being able to read the signs.\nShe started walking down the street, looking around for anything that screamed of jail cells or law and order. She tried very hard not to think about what she’d do if Relc or Klbkch were both off-duty.",

    "text": "Relc was off-duty. So was Klbkch. But for the moment, Relc was lounging around the mess hall of the guard’s barracks. He was playing a game where he tossed a wickedly sharp dagger up into the air and caught it as it fell back towards the floor. Half the time, he caught the dagger. The other half, he missed or knocked the dagger flying. He sat in a widely vacated corner of the room.\nOnly a few other Drakes were sitting at the long wooden benches, chowing down on hard bread, cheese, and unidentifiable strips of meat. Well, unidentifiable to Humans. It was more grey than red.\nOne of the guards was talking with his fellows. He stood up and approached Relc cautiously. Unlike Relc, his scales were a very pale blue, and he was smaller if not shorter than the other Drake. He cleared his throat while standing at a respectful distance from Relc’s game.\n“Hey Relc. I hear there’s a Human wandering around the city.”\nRelc looked up and missed the dagger as it flipped down.\n“Ow.”\nThe other guardsman sighed as Relc sucked at the point of red blood oozing from his scales.\n“You’ve got no talent for that game. If you didn’t have [Thick Scales], you’d have cut your hand off years ago.”\nRelc smiled smugly.\n“[Iron Scales].”\nThe blue Drake rolled his eyes.\n“That explains everything. What kind of level do you have to be to get that, anyways? No one else has it, so it must be high level.”\n“It is.”\nRelc began trimming his claws with the dagger. Although in his case, he wasn’t making the nails shorter, just sharpening them.\n“It was the last skill I got from my [Sergeant] class. I think you get it in [Spearmaster] as well, but I don’t know. Either way, it’s a life-saver.”\n“I’ll bet. No wonder you don’t worry about hurting yourself, you smooth-scaled bastard.”\n“Now, now. Don’t be jealous.”\nRelc swept the nail clippings off the table with one hand.\n“Too bad I never got any dagger skills. I can’t understand how this stupid flipping works.”\n“Then stop flipping. It’s annoying, and you keep nearly hitting people. Remember poor Tkrn the day he signed up? He still flinches whenever he sees a dagger.”\n“No. If Klbkch can do it, so can I. Anything that damn bug can do I can do better. But hey, what’s this about a Human? Is it that female one I was telling you about?”\n“Not sure.”\nThis time, another green Drake jumped into the conversation.\n“Belsc—the guy on eastern gate duty—he didn’t say much other than that he thought it was a Human female. What was the name of the one you met?”\nRelc scratched his head and looked up at the ceiling.\n“Um. Erin something. Sol? Solace? It was something like that. Erin Solace? Did he mention anything else about her?”\nThe blue-scaled Drake bared his teeth.\n“Yeah. He said she was really annoying. And she talked too much.”\n“That’s her.”\nRelc laughed. The other Drake shook his head as a few more [Guards] glanced over.\n“Humans. I don’t know why you’re interested in this one. It’s certainly not the smell, to hear Belsc talk.”\n“Yeah, you get used to that.”\nRelc leaned back in his chair and played with the dagger. He smiled to himself, warming to his theme of stupid Humans. It was a popular topic in Liscor—especially with the annual Blood Fields battle almost upon them. He felt a tiny bit guilty, but he was also still mad about yesterday.\nShe’d chosen a [Necromancer] over him. Which was just Humans sticking to their own kind, so Relc kept talking as he trimmed at his nails.\n“Still, she’s interesting. Erin, or whatever her name is. She makes a mean plate of pasta, let me tell you. And she’s tougher than she looks—I didn’t think any Human could survive out in the Floodplains that long. She’s funny too.”\nHe grinned as the other guards made disparaging noises. Relc raised his voice.\n“Hey, I’m telling the truth here. Little Miss Human isn’t that bad. You should meet her. But let me tell you, she can also be pretty annoying. Remember that [Necromancer] guy I told you me and Klbkch tracked down? She wouldn’t let us kill him even after he blasted us both with a few spells. Just kept saying that he wasn’t that bad.”\n“Stupid Humans.”\n“I know!”\nRelc nodded in agreement with the other guard.\n“They’re interesting and entertaining, but they don’t have much inside their fleshy heads. I’d never trust a Human to have my back. Drakes stick together and Humans do their thing in the north, am I right?”\nRelc looked around for confirmation as the other Drakes laughed with him. He laughed boisterously until he saw the young woman staring at him across the mess hall. His laughter cut off instantly.\n“Oh.”\nThe other Drakes looked over in curiosity at the Human female. She wasn’t that special to them; one Human looked much like any other. She was staring at Relc, who looked extremely uncomfortable.\nHe cleared his throat.\n“Um. I—”\nThe door closed behind Erin as she walked out.\nA nasty silence fell over the mess hall. Relc looked at the others.\n“How long was she here?”\nThe blue Drake shrugged.\n“Dunno. She must’ve walked in while you were talking.”\n“Oh, bite me.”\nRelc leapt up from his chair.\n“Hey, Miss Human! Wait! I didn’t mean it!”\nThe other Drakes watched as he dashed out of the room. Then they turned back to their conversation. One of the Gnolls flicked his gaze towards the blue-scaled Drake, who looked slightly smug at how everything had gone down.\n“So. When did you spot her?”\n“Right at the start. Did you see her expression? Relc’s not gonna have an easy time explaining that.”\n“Serves him right. But did you smell her?”\n“Yeah.\nHumans\n. They don’t wash.”\n“I hear they roll around in their own filth.”\n“Disgusting. Why’s Relc interested in one anyways?”\n“Why do you think?”\n“I still don’t get it. There’s no scales, nothing\nfirm\nto grab. What’s the point?”\n“Search me. Maybe it’s just Relc. He’s weird.”\n“True.”\n“Anyways, Humans. Haven’t seen one in a long time. Did you see it? So\nfleshy.\n”\n“Disgusting. Let’s go eat some meat.”\n“Agreed.”",

    "text": "Erin walked out of the city gates and through the grass. She walked as fast as she could, which wasn’t very. The cloth bag she was carrying was more like a satchel, and it was loaded down with a lot of stuff. She was impressed that it could fit the bag of flour and other ingredients she’d bought without the fabric breaking, but it also meant she had to carry all of that on her shoulders.\nThe bag of flour was quite heavy. But Erin carried it anyways, ignoring the pain in her right shoulder. Her left one was already sore. She’d switch shoulders when the pain became unbearable.\n“Hey! Miss Erin! Wait!”\nErin kept walking.\n“Oh come on. Please?”\nRelc appeared next to her in a blur. He was quick for such a huge guy. Erin turned her head so she didn’t have to look at him directly.\n“So, how’s my favorite Human doing? Good? Bad? Um. I, uh, don’t suppose you heard what I was saying. It was just a joke, really. I didn’t mean…”\nShe kept walking. Erin’s feet were already sore, but she put one foot in front of the other. She had a long way to go to get back to the inn, and the bag she was carrying was heavy.\n“Look, I know I was sort of—okay, I was rude, but let’s talk. Hello? Are you listening?”\nErin didn’t look at him or speak. She just kept walking. Put one foot in front of the other. She was so tired and sore she barely felt hungry.",

    "text": "Eventually, he went away. Erin kept walking though. She was trying to make it back to the inn before the sun set. It was going to be a close race.\nShe was about halfway to her destination when the first stone flew over her head. Erin instinctively ducked and so the next two stones missed her and landed in the grass. She looked around.\nAt first, she couldn’t spot where the stones were coming from. Two more missed her, but the third struck her on the shoulder.\n“Ow.\nOw!\n”\nErin spotted the origin of the stones. It was a Goblin. The small creature was hard to spot in the fading twilight. It was standing on a hill and hurling rocks down at Erin. And it wasn’t alone.\nTwo more Goblins screeched and threw stones at her from their hilltop, making her flinch away and pull the bag up to shield her head. But then they just pelted her legs. They were bigger than the first one and staring at her burdens.\nHer food.\nThey wanted her food, and they’d laid an ambush! Erin tried to shield her head with the bag of flour and got a sharp strike to the chest.\n“Ah. Ow.”\nShe covered her face with her arms. The stones kept flying. And they\nhurt\n. Even at this distance, the rocks cut her arms and bruised her flesh. Already, she felt blood trickling down one arm.\nErin knelt on the ground and shielded her head with her bag. That made her less of a target, but the barrage of stones continued. It wasn’t as if the Goblins could hurt her, not so long as they kept hitting her back, but they just didn’t stop. And if she got up, they’d aim for her head.\nWhat could she do? Erin felt the stinging hail cut into her back. She had to run. At them? Away? They’d steal all her food if she did. But could she attack them? Fight? If she got any closer, the stones could gouge out her eyes, injure her badly. What could she do? What could she—\nSomething\nmoved past Erin in a blast of air. She flinched and looked around, but it was already gone. Then her eyes travelled to the hill. Someone was rushing at the Goblins, ducking under the stones and deflecting the ones that came close to his head with a fast-moving…spear…?\n“\nHey!\nSlither off, you little bastards!”\nThe stones stopped flying abruptly. Erin heard a high-pitched scream and several heavy\nthwacks\n. Cautiously, she got up and looked around.\nThe Goblins were running away in full retreat. Relc stood on the hilltop, spear in hand. He waved at her and leapt down the hill in a few long strides.\n“Hello there, Miss Erin. Fancy meeting you here.”\nErin stared up at him. He offered her a toothy grin and a hand up. She stood up by herself and picked up her bag.\nRelc cleared his throat expectantly.\n“It’s not often I get to rescue a damsel in distress. That’s what they call Human females, right? Damsels? Anyways, I saw you were in trouble, so I immediately rushed to help.”\n“Thanks.”\nErin began walking again. She heard Relc follow after a second’s hesitation.\n“Okay, okay. So they weren’t that dangerous. And I was just doing my job; true. But I\nam\nsorry. Really. I said too much back there.”\nShe said nothing. Her vision was blurring over from the cutting pain of the bag’s strap as it carved a groove into her shoulder.\n“That looks heavy. Here, let me carry it for you.”\nRelc reached for the bag. Erin pulled away.\n“No. I’m fine.”\n“Oh come on. Don’t be like that. I just—well, it was just me being careless, alright? Let’s talk. Please?”\nErin tried to walk faster, but her legs were already giving up. Relc easily kept pace with her. He was even able to walk backwards faster than her.\n“Look. I’m very sorry, Miss Erin. Let me carry your bag. It must be quite heavy, and this way we can talk without one of us falling over.”\nErin grudgingly slowed down. It was a tempting offer. Her legs were screaming at her to accept Relc’s generous offer and have him carry her as well. Her shoulder was already in another dimension of pain.\n“Fine.”\nShe unslung the bag, wincing as blood returned to her arm. Relc lifted the bag with one hand and slung it over his shoulder. Then he kept pace with Erin as if nothing had happened.\n“So.”\n“So.”\nRelc scratched the spines on the back of his head, looked down, looked up, and sighed.\n“I really didn’t mean it. It’s just—[Necromancers], y’know? They’re dangerous. And it’s best to kill them on sight. You ever seen a thousand zombies trying to eat anything in sight? Even if they’re low-level, even if they play nice, I could never trust a [Necromancer].”\n“Especially not if they’re Human.”\n“I didn’t say that.”\n“But that’s what you think.”\nRelc didn’t have anything to say to that. They both walked on in silence, faster now that the bag wasn’t weighing Erin down.\n“So. You bought food, huh? Making lots of pasta tonight?”\n“I’m going to sleep.”\n“Right, right. But, uh, good to see you made it to the city. So how’d you like it?”\n“It’s fine.”\n“Good, good.”\nRelc was clearly casting around desperately for subject matters. He peeked into the bag. Erin could practically feel him salivating.\n“Sausages. Mm. But hey, why didn’t you buy any clothes? I thought all females loved clothes, Drake or Human.”\nErin’s stomach twisted. She avoided his gaze and mumbled.\n“I didn’t have enough money.”\n“What, really?”\nRelc looked at her askance and peered into the bag he was carrying.\n“No. I mean, there’s food in here, but that’s only a few silver coins at best. I’m sure you had more than that, right? How much did you spend?”\nErin felt her face heating up. She looked at the ground.\n“A couple gold coins. Some silver ones.”\nHe stopped. Erin didn’t. She heard him muttering to himself and then swearing. It sounded like swearing. He loped forwards and was next to her in an instant.\n“Really? What kind of rotscale sold you—\nwhy\ndid you spend that much money?”\nShe stared at the grass as she trampled it. It was tinted with a lovely deep orange color in the sun’s fading glow.\n“I just thought it was the right price, I guess. I didn’t want to argue.”\nRelc muttered under his breath and sighed in exasperation.\n“Well, I could go back to the market and ask around. But—I don’t suppose you caught the name of the store.”\n“I can’t read the language here.”\nRelc sighed again. Deeply.\n“Right, right. Well, if you remembered his face, I could find who sold you all that, but I doubt anyone’d bear witness against him. And there’s not much for me to go on. I mean, he sold you overpriced goods but it\nwas\nyour fault as well. No offense meant, Miss, but how’d you trade a gold coin for a sack or two of flour?”\nErin couldn’t think of anything to say to that.\n“Sorry.”\nThey walked on in silence. At last, the inn was in sight. Erin trudged up the last incline, her legs screaming all the way. She paused at the door.\n“I can take the bag now.”\nRelc hesitated.\n“You sure? I can carry it in—”\n“I’m sure.”\nErin accepted the bag, and her legs wobbled. She opened the door with one hand.\n“Right. Thanks.”\nShe wanted to close the door, but Relc held it open effortlessly. He scratched at the back of his neck awkwardly.\n“Look, I’m still really sorry about before. I didn’t mean—well, I’m sorry. I’ll make it up to you, I promise.”\nErin looked up at him. She just wanted to close her eyes. But he seemed sincere. So she mustered a bit of sincerity herself.\n“Thanks for helping. With the Goblins.”\nRelc gave her a wide, toothy grin.\n“It was nothing. They’re no threat to me or anyone with a few levels in any warrior class. But don’t worry about those pests. I said I’d make it up to you, didn’t I? I’ll do something about them.”\nMaybe it was an empty promise. But it made Erin smile a tiny bit.\n“Thanks. Good night.”\nRelc curled his tail up and flicked her a salute with both hand and tail at the same time.\n“Until later, Miss Erin.”\nErin watched as he rapidly disappeared into the dark landscape. She vaguely envied the speed and effortless grace with which he moved. Then she closed the door.",

    "text": "The moment she threw the first stone, the littlest Goblin felt bad. Especially when it nearly hit the Human in the face. But she had to, because the two older Goblins made her.\nThey’d found her sneaking around the inn and had pulled at her ears. Hard. She was wasting time when she\nshould\nbe gathering things, making grass baskets, or doing something for the tribe.\nShe had screeched and protested, but then they’d all seen the Human coming back to her inn.\nWith food.\nThey could smell it.\nThe older Goblins, male and female, had debated. They knew that the warriors had lost to her and they had no chance of killing her even with their rusted daggers. But if they threw stones, she’d have to drop the food. Then the littlest Goblin could run down, grab some, and run off.\nThe littlest Goblin was so hungry—always hungry—that she did what they told her to. They were tossing stones down at the Human as she shouted at them. Just some food! Just\ndrop\nthe bag! The older Goblins were aiming at her eyes, but the littlest Goblin pelted the Human’s arms.\nThen the scary Drake appeared, and they ran. The littlest Goblin fled, screaming, then hid in the grass and crawled away. Only after an hour did she get up and run back to her cave.\nIt was a bad day, and she was hungry.\nAnd—\nthe littlest Goblin was sniveling already when she got back to their hidden cave—the two older Goblins would tell the Chieftain she had wasted time and that they hadn’t gotten food.\nThey were always mean to her. Always made her go with them gathering food or sharpening knives…or told her to stop counting birds and\nhelp gather food.\nThey poked and prodded and pinched her ears more than most, because they had made her.\nSomehow. Just like Goblins were born, the littlest Goblin had a vague idea of how it all worked, but those two were hers. Not that it meant they were nicer; they found her when she sat and tried to think or have fun and dragged her back.\nSometimes the two gave her food even when there wasn’t any to go around and showed her how things worked. Sometimes they got mad and poked and hit her if she wasn’t working, but it seemed to her like they always found her even when she was hiding, as if they knew her better than even the Chieftain.\nShe skulked into the tribe’s cave, wishing she had a Skill to make herself hide. She was waiting for the Chieftain to roar at her or just for a\nswat\n. But the tribe was busy eating.\nSpiders. Cooked spiders in a big pot with water. It was…not good. Even for them. But it was what they had, and a few eggs made it taste like something. The littlest Goblin actually got a bowl and brightened up.\nMaybe she wasn’t in trouble! She was sure she’d get only half her food because she was in so much trouble. She looked around for the two older Goblins and didn’t see them. Maybe they were still after the Human’s food?\nShe felt a pang in her stomach at the thought of being punished later. So she went back to her collection of sticks and rocks and thought of how much food that big place had to have. A\ncity.\nThe Chieftain sometimes said the other peoples had all kinds of good food, but behind those walls. They couldn’t even raid a caravan; there were too many dangerous Drakes or Gnolls or Humans, with steel armor and magic.\nBut what if you could get in there? Could you hide and steal some food and live there? Could\nthey\nhave a city like that?\nThe littlest Goblin was so caught up in the idea that she distracted herself for a long time, wondering what that Human had done to get an entire\nbag\nof food. Flour. She knew it from the older Goblins coveting the powdery stuff. You could make all kinds of things with it. Thick soup, crunchy bread, or just eat it raw and…\n“\nWhere?\n”\nA growl brought the littlest Goblin out of her stupor. She jumped in fright and then saw the huge Chieftain’s face an inch from hers. She tried to run, and he grabbed her by one leg.\nThe time for punishment had come. The littlest Goblin dangled there as the Chieftain held her. She began to babble excuses—she\nmeant\nto steal the Human’s food—and saw a quizzical look on his face.\n“\nWhere? Two?\n”\nHe shook her and gestured eloquently to the two empty pallets of dried grass. Then the littlest Goblin realized…he didn’t know about her sneaking off and wasting time. He wasn’t mad at her for that.\nHe wanted to know where the other two Goblins were. The littlest Goblin stared at the blank pallets and realized there had been a bit more soup, because they’d never come back with her.\nWere they still out there, trying to steal the Human’s food? Maybe sneak in when she was asleep? She babbled an explanation and instantly got a\nbonk\non the head.\nSniveling, she clutched at her head as the Chieftain roared at her. Go find them! And bring back food!\nShe was afraid of the dark, but more afraid of his wrath. So she wormed her way out of the cave and ran back to the inn. She searched around a few hills, hoping the other two would see her and scold her and she could bring them back to the Chieftain. If they had to steal from the Human…\nThen the littlest Goblin smelled something on the air. Something\nwet\n, like iron. She froze in place, and a Drake stretched as he stood up.\n“\nGot you bastards.\nYou can’t run from Relc! Damn, I thought there were three of you? Whatever. If Erin doesn’t love this—now I need to find some wood. Damn. I should be having dinner!”\nHe chortled to himself and whirled a spear up and brought it down in one movement. So gracefully. The littlest Goblin didn’t understand what he was laughing about, but she smelled something familiar in the air. Something like metal. Something like…\nShe stared down at the two bodies in the grass. The Drake hummed as he drew his sword.\n“Two coppers per ear…nah. Stick. Stick. You’ve gotta put them on sticks and—you know what? She can figure out how she wants to mount them.”\nHe gathered a pair of round objects up as the little Goblin stared down at him from her hiding place. She didn’t move. She didn’t breathe. She just looked at the two little bodies the Drake kicked down the hill. He walked off, humming under his breath in the night.",

    "text": "It was just before dawn when the little Goblin crawled into the tribe’s cave. The sleepy [Warrior] on duty growled at her—then noticed she was still alone. He nearly swatted her, but then smelled her. Then…he backed away and pointed to a slumbering mass.\nThe Chieftain woke up with a huge growl of anger. He looked at the littlest Goblin, raising a fist—\nShe didn’t think she said anything. She just sat there, mumbling down at the ground. And the Chieftain…\nThe grumpy Chieftain sat there and did not hit her. Though it was surely her fault. He picked up the littlest Goblin, tossed her into her sleeping pallet, and sat there.\nHead lowered. Head bowed. The other Goblins in their tribe sat around him or worked mechanically, dully and silently.\nBut the Chieftain just stared at nothing. Stared at the smoky embers of the fire. Though the smoke stung his eyes—he did not weep. Goblins didn’t weep. Even the littlest Goblin. But the Chieftain stared down at the ground. Then he reached for something.\nHis axes. He stood slowly and asked one question of his tribe.\nWhere was that Human? The littlest Goblin didn’t know if he’d heard her wrong or if he was looking for the Drake. The Chieftain walked out of the cave.\nShe did not stop him. She just sat there. Wondering why today had been like this.",

The old linens she’d piled up to make a bed made her sneeze.\n“I need to buy fresher pillows. And blankets. Or laundry detergent. When I have the money for it.”\nInstead, she just used the cloth bag she’d bought as a pillow. Erin tried to get comfortable on the hardwood floor, but the very nature of it was giving her a…hard time. Besides, her shoulders ached. Her legs still hurt from the long walk. And if it were only that which hurt, she would already be asleep.\nBut instead Erin lay in the silence, listening to her heart beat. She wanted to say something, to think something, better. But there wasn’t anything. So she stared at the hazy shapes in the dark room. It took a long time before her eyes closed.\n[Innkeeper Level 6!]\nThis time, she said nothing at all.

    "text": "Erin woke up tired and bleary-eyed. She mechanically got up and remembered that she’d forgotten to gather any blue fruits. She looked at the bag full of food she’d dragged all the way to the inn. It was too much work to make pasta or bread, so she ate one of the sausages instead.\nIt was dried, too salty, and had lots of gristle. Even though Erin was starving, it was\nnot\nthe best thing she’d ever eaten. But she ate it anyways, chewing until she could swallow the greasy meal.\nDully, Erin wondered how long it would take for her teeth to rot or her gums to start bleeding. Not too long now.\nIt wasn’t a good day. But at least she had food. And if she didn’t have money, at least it was a new day.\nWith her stomach full, Erin felt a little better. Ready to face the day, at least. She made a mental list of what to do. Gather blue fruit first. Then she’d make some pasta, some bread, and then she’d figure out how to—\nKnock. Knock.\nErin jolted upright. Someone was at the door. Was it Pisces? Well, it was just another headache for the day. She’d deal with him and—\nKnockknockknockknockknockknock—\nIt\nwasn’t\nPisces. Erin got up and went over to the door. Whoever was there was seriously excited. Too energetic at this time of day.\nErin yanked open the door.\n“Who the\nhell\n—oh. It’s you.”\nRelc grinned at Erin. He was holding something in one hand and his spear in the other.\n“Good morning, Miss Human! It’s me, your favorite [Guardsman]! And how are you doing this fine morning?”\nErin blinked at him. It was far too early to have to stare at a giant lizard grinning at her with a mouth full of sharp teeth.\n“Hey Erin, I’ve just taken care of your Goblin problem for you! Took all damn night, but that’s how much I wanted to apologize. See?”\nRelc raised his spear triumphantly. A bit of something fell to the ground. Erin blinked and stared at it. Red.\nShe looked up and saw red blood dripping down the spear, running along Relc’s claw and onto the floor of her inn. Relc noticed that and pulled the spear back outside.\n“Sorry about that, Miss Erin. You see, I was just disposing of the Goblins. Call it me making up for yesterday. But now that they’re gone, the others should leave you alone, especially once I set these up around the inn. Uh, do you have any sticks? I need some sticks or something.”\nRelc lifted the objects in his left hand. Erin looked at them and saw two melons. Green melons? No.\nHer eyes went back up to Relc’s grinning face. She stared at his bloody spear. He was talking, but the words were suddenly impossible to make out over the buzzing in Erin’s ears. She looked at his smile. She looked at the spear, still covered in drying red blood.\nShe looked down and saw the heads.\nThere were two of them in Relc’s claw. He’d grabbed them by their ears, and the force was already tearing the dead flesh. Each one’s eyes were still open, their lifeless expressions twisted in fear. Blood still dripped from one, down into the eye sockets of another.\nErin’s eyes wandered up and away from the heads. She stared out past Relc’s shoulder. It was a beautiful day outside. The sun was shining. The sky was blue. There wasn’t a cloud in the sky.\nShe looked down at the heads. They were still there. She looked up at Relc. He was still speaking, but stopped and looked at her in concern. He dropped the heads carelessly to the ground. Erin heard each one\nthump\nwetly on the floorboards of the inn.\nRelc raised his clawed hand and reached out for her. The same one he’d held the heads with.\nErin threw up. She vomited up the sausages, choked, and threw up some more.\n“——————!”\nShe felt a hand holding her, helping her upright. She pushed away at it, retched.\n“——? ——. ————!”\nHer head was spinning. Her ears were filled with a piercing, high-pitched sound.\n“——————? ——?”\nErin looked around. The heads were still there. She threw up again, but there was nothing left. But still, she threw up bile, and then retched and retched until she couldn’t breathe or think.\n“——!”\nAt last, Erin stopped. She felt strong hands lifting her up and felt herself being sat in a chair in the inn. Relc’s anxious face peered at her, and she felt his hand on her temple. She stared past him at the heads. They were lying on the floor of the inn. Their eyes were open. Blood had dried on their faces.\nErin took one deep breath. The world spun around her, and she heard nothing. Just static. She felt numb, like she was in surgery. But underneath that numbness was something terrible.\nShe looked at Relc. The Drake was fussing over her, trying to get her attention. She looked back at the heads. Then she began to scream. He reached for her, with concern in his eyes. A blank look of uncomprehending concern. Then…confusion. Frustration. Outrage.\nThe Drake looked down at the two heads on the ground and laughed. Through the ringing in her ears, she saw him kick one slightly with a toe, then recoil and clap his hands to his earholes. He stared at her. Then he shouted, threw up his hands, and turned. Came back, pointing a finger, and she—\nShe kept screaming, like that wordless howl in her ears.",

    "text": "Erin walked outside with the two Goblin heads in her arms. They weren’t cold. They weren’t warm, either. They were just fleshy. Heavy, fleshy. And dead.\nShe made sure not to drop them as she walked. She didn’t know where she was going, only that she had to find the bodies. She left the inn behind and began walking.\nRelc was gone. He’d left sometime earlier.\nShe didn’t remember anything. Just flashes of her screaming at Relc to\nget out\nand hurling things. Screaming, crying, vomiting. And then the heads. Picking them up where they lay.\nErin walked with them in her arms. Everything was going by too quickly. One moment she was inside, the next she was out, looking around for…for…\nThe bodies.\nThe dead bodies were lying out in the open. Two corpses lay in a bed of trampled grass at the base of a hill. There was nothing—graceful about it. There was no dignity. Just flies, buzzing already. The Drake hadn’t done anything, just removed their heads and presented them to her like a trophy. Like an apology gift.\nErin stopped. She placed the two heads on the ground and walked over to the bodies. They told a story. She wasn’t good at forensics or anything like that, but she could still read what had happened. The blood was still wet on the ground.\nTwo died…there. At the top of the hill, running. Relc had probably cut the first one down in an instant. The other had run, but not far. He’d made it only a few steps before a spear had stabbed him from behind. Multiple times.\nErin looked at the bloody holes and felt nothing. No. That wasn’t right. She felt something. She felt so many emotions she couldn’t think. But they were buried deep within her heart. Right now, the numbness made her feel like she was in the middle of a silent world.\nShe placed the heads down next to the bodies. Which belonged to which? She looked at the cuts around each head. The…the cuts were too similar to match one to a body. She had to roll over the corpses to check the other side.\nThe sunlight kept their bodies warm. But they were still cold, and Erin’s hands were colder still. She flipped them over carefully and learned something else.\nOne was male, one was female. It was hard to tell from their faces, but they were distinctly a pair. The same who’d been throwing stones at her? Hadn’t there been three?\nShe didn’t know. Erin couldn’t think. The coldness grew worse. Erin began to shake. She crawled away to throw up, but found she couldn’t. So she went back and stared at the two bodies.\nTheir blood had long stopped flowing, but the grass was still red. They smelled, but only of dirt and blood. Not of death and rot. Not yet. But they were rotting. And in the sun, they would start to stink soon.\nErin knew this. She didn’t\nknow\nit, but she’d read about it. They would rot and attract bugs. They were already.\nA green fly landed on one of the bodies. Erin stared at it. An Acid Fly. It fanned its wings and began to crawl over the male Goblin’s body.\nShe swatted it. The bug exploded as her hand struck it, and the acid burned her palm. Erin scrubbed her hand in the grass and rubbed dirt on her skin. It was raw and red, but she ignored it as soon as most of the burning had stopped.\nShe needed to bury the bodies. Or they would rot.\nErin went inside the inn. She came out a few minutes later holding a long wooden spoon. It was probably used for stirring one of the big pots. It would do.\nShe began digging in the grass where the bodies lay. It was hard work. She had to tear out the grass before she could pry at the soil. And even then, the ground wasn’t easy to break up. But she persisted, and the few clumps of dirt grew as she dug deeper.\nSlowly. Like making a sandcastle at the beach. Erin dug down, and the pile of dirt beside her grew. The hole was small, and every time she tried to scoop out more dirt, the walls caved in. But she kept digging. And the pile of dirt grew.\nAt some point, the wooden spoon broke. Erin used her hands. They began to bleed after a while. She kept digging.\nAt last, the hole was big enough. Erin picked up the first body and laid it in the grave. It fit. It more than fit. The hole she’d dug was big enough for a Human, which meant more than enough to fit both Goblins inside.\nThey were such small creatures. Erin vaguely wondered if she should dig one more grave.\nShe looked down at her bloody hands and broken nails. No.\nShe placed the second body in the grave, next to the first. Then came the heads. She placed each with their body. One, and then two.\nAs Erin picked up the second head, she heard a sound. She turned around and saw the Goblin standing in the long grass.\nThe Goblin was small and ragged. It was wearing a grey, stained loincloth and a few rags tied to its chest. It held a small knife. It stared at Erin and the head she held in her hands.\nErin paused. Her head was still filled with static, but her mouth tried to say something. Too late. The Goblin rushed at her, screaming wildly and slashing with the dagger.\nErin stepped back. She held the last Goblin’s head in one hand and waited until the other Goblin was close. She leapt sideways at the last moment, and the small Goblin missed her. It turned, still flailing its weapon.\nShe slapped the Goblin as hard as she could across the face. Her hand made a\nkrack\nas she sent the Goblin tumbling to the ground, and it lost hold of the dagger it was carrying. It whimpered and fled from Erin, scrabbling after the weapon in the grass.\nErin was still staring at the Goblin as it seized the dagger and spun to face her. It was small. So small. Like a child. This one was a child. But it had murder in its eyes.\nErin’s mind was still hazy. But as the Goblin stared at her in tense silence, she realized what she wanted to say. It came to her when she saw the tears running from the Goblin’s red eyes.\n“I don’t want to kill you.”\nIt rushed at her. Erin stepped forward and\nkicked\nthe Goblin in the stomach. She’d done that to a boy as a child, only now she was kicking a child.\nThe Goblin vomited and then curled up into a little ball of pain. It tried to scrabble away from her, but it was in too much pain. Erin stared at the Goblin lying on the ground. She still held the head of the other Goblin in her hands.\nThe smart thing to do would be to kill it. She’d level up, and then she’d be rid of one less Goblin trying to kill her. If she let it live, it would get reinforcements. She’d never be safe so long as they were around. They were dangerous monsters. They’d kill her in her sleep and eat her or do worse if they could. It was survival of the fittest. She’d pay for letting it live. It was it or her. She had to—\nThe thoughts ran through Erin’s head as she looked at the twitching Goblin. It was small. She turned and placed the last head with the bodies.\nWhen she turned around, the Goblin was gone.\nErin put the last head in the grave and stared at it. Then she slowly began to fill in the rest of the grave.\nIt was a long process. Erin packed the dirt in tightly and made a mound of the rest. She pushed on the dirt and made it as firm as possible. Then she stared at the uneven pile of upturned soil.\nErin placed her hands together and bowed her head. Then she let her hands fall away. There were no words for her to say. So she patted the last bit of dirt into place and sat down on the grass.\nThe sun was shining. The sky was a deep, deep blue. She didn’t cry. She just sat and rocked back and forth as she stared at the grave she’d dug.\nErin didn’t blink.",

    "text": "She looked up when she heard the horn.\nIt was no echoing bass rumble of a dread army’s herald. And neither was it a clarion call to victory sounded upon a dark battlefield. It just sounded like a horn. But it was loud. And it made her look up.\nA Goblin stood upon a hill and stared down at her. He was nearly a head taller than Erin. So he was very big for a Goblin, but small, still. His body was muscled and wide, but taut, as of someone starved for enough food. His head was covered by a rusted helmet, and he wore mismatched bits of metal armor on his body.\nEven without being told, Erin knew he was the leader of whatever Goblin tribe lived around here. And she also knew he was out for blood.\nHers.\nShe got up slowly. It wasn’t that she was terrified; it was that she was still in shock. She backed away slowly as the Goblin Chieftain pulled something from behind his back.\nHer thoughts scrambled together. The inn? Or the city? She could probably outrun him, but the other Goblins were sure to be nearby. So where were they?\nErin was so busy looking out for other Goblins sneaking up on her that she only realized that the Chieftain was holding a bow when he fired the first shot.\nAn arrow struck the grass next to her feet and quivered in the packed soil. Erin turned and ran.\nA second arrow missed her as well. So did the third. The fourth passed through the gap between her pumping arms.\nErin crested a small hill and immediately dove. She hit the grass face-first and slid painfully, and the fifth arrow missed the spot where her back had been. She got to her feet to run again and saw the Goblins.\nThey stood together, a silent wall of small bodies and red, staring eyes. They were staring at her. Not many all told. Forty? Less? If she had to guess, it was a small tribe. Smaller than the one she’d run away from that first day. But they were all armed. She waited for them to charge. She waited to die.\nNot one of them moved. They watched her, that was all. They made no sound.\nOne of them was quivering. It was standing close to Erin and holding a knife. A small knife, held by a small hand. Erin recognized it.\nIt was the ragged Goblin from earlier. It stared at Erin, and she stared back. She could tell it wanted to cut her, to attack. But it didn’t.\nA horn blew from the other side of the hill. Erin looked up. The Goblin Chieftain. He was the one who was orchestrating it all.\nSo. She stared back at the Goblin. It stared back, hatred and death in its eyes. Crimson eyes. They were unnatural, monstrous.\nBut still, they were too much like a Human’s.\n“I didn’t kill them.”\nErin said it out loud. She didn’t expect it to understand, but the Goblin jerked in surprise. It looked at her, searching for the meaning in Erin’s words. The young woman looked into those sad, crimson eyes and saw the pupils lost and staring. She spoke, her voice rasping.\n“I didn’t kill them, but it doesn’t matter.”\nIt looked into her eyes. Erin looked right back. Then she got up and ran.",

    "text": "They didn’t scream as they followed her. That was the scariest part. The Goblin tribe followed Erin swiftly, running as fast as they could to keep up, but they didn’t move to cut her off. They just followed.\nMaybe they would have stopped her if she’d run for the city. But Erin ran for her inn and so they let her go. They weren’t here to kill her. Just to watch.\nWithout being told, Erin knew this was different. If it were just a fight or them trying to kill her, they would have swarmed her and ripped her to shreds in an instant. But this was a hunt.\nAnd the Chieftain was the one hunting her.\nMaybe he thought she was easy prey. He was right. And he probably could have guessed Erin wasn’t the one who killed the Goblins. It didn’t matter. It was blood for blood. The oldest of vengeances.\nErin thought all this as she hurtled through the door of her inn and blocked it with as many tables and chairs as she could. She knew it as she scrambled to find a kitchen knife, a frying pan—anything to defend herself. And she knew it when she sat in a chair and tasted death in the air.\nShe gave up on looking for a weapon. She sat and stared at the door. She heard the Chieftain’s horn call far away and then again as he drew closer slowly.\nThere was nowhere to run. And she couldn’t fight.\nIt had dawned on her as she was holding the sharp kitchen knife. She’d been trying to imagine her facing the armored Goblin, dodging blows, countering with a slash and then cutting—\nNo. It was impossible.\nShe was no warrior.\nErin sat in the wooden chair and felt it rub against her t-shirt. She felt her hands, slick with sweat. She tasted blood from running too hard and felt each breath tear a hole in her lungs. She was alive. She knew she wasn’t dreaming.\nAnd she knew she was going to die.\n“Checkmate.”\nShe sat at the table in the inn and stared at the door. It occurred to her, suddenly, that this was the first time she’d sat around and really had a chance to think. Because this was, in a sense, the first time she’d ever had when she wasn’t reacting blindly to events.\nMaybe if she’d taken more time earlier, she would never have come to this point. If she’d thought ahead, maybe she’d have asked Klbkch and Relc how much food was worth. If she’d thought for a second, she would have known what Relc meant by taking care of the Goblins yesterday. Maybe then she’d have stopped Relc from killing the Goblins.\nBut she hadn’t. So she was here. But it was a terrible thing, waiting. So Erin sat and thought.\n“I’ll think. I’ll think for once about it.”\nErin closed her eyes and tried to ignore the horn as it blew from far away. The Goblin Chieftain wasn’t moving fast. He was probably walking, saving his energy for when he got here. He was in no hurry.\nShe thought about Goblins. She thought about how they had leaders, and how it was the leader’s job to defend his people. Maybe he didn’t care about them. And maybe he wouldn’t take revenge if it were an adventurer or guardsman that killed them and then went back into a city with stone walls. But what about a stupid Human living by herself out in the middle of nowhere?\nShe thought about the small Goblin who’d attacked her. She thought about families, and thought about her parents. She thought about the Goblin Chieftain and his axes and armor.\nShe thought about what would happen to her when he caught her.\n“Checkmate.”\nErin whispered it again. It sounded wrong, for some reason.\nCheckmate. She’d heard that word too many times. But those had been games. This was real life. And she—she didn’t want to die.\nBut she was about to. That was why she was sitting in the inn. Erin heard the horn blaring again in the distance and knew that death was coming. So. Checkmate.\nWas it? She had to ask. Erin whispered to herself a single question.\n“Is it checkmate or just check?”\nErin stared at her hands. She hadn’t washed them. And she could still feel the clammy, lifeless head in her palms. She sat in the inn and stared down into the lifeless eyes of the two Goblin heads.\nHorn call.\nShe looked up at the door. The big Goblin was moving slowly. He wanted her to be afraid. To despair. To panic. There was nowhere to run. And if the only options were to fight and kill or run and die—\n“If only it were dying.”\nErin whispered those words. She didn’t want to die. But better than anything else. So. Fight. And kill.\n“I can’t do it.”\nBut she had to. Erin started shaking. There was no option. It was as clear a choice as she’d known. She could run or hide, and maybe, maybe she’d succeed. But if he caught her, she’d have to fight and win. And to win, she’d have to kill him. It was kill him or give up.\n“Checkmate.”\nDid she have a fever? Erin’s body flashed between burning heat and empty cold. She was shaking, but something inside of her was calm. So terribly calm.\nErin closed her eyes. She knew. But she didn’t want to. Her mouth was dry, but she forced herself to speak.\n“Oh Father who art in Heaven…”\nHer voice trailed off. She’d forgotten the rest long ago. And there was no God to listen to her. No merciful god would condone what she was about to do.\nErin opened her eyes. She stared at her hands and thought. Who was her enemy?\nA Goblin. Not just any Goblin, but a Chieftain. A leader among their kind. Strong? Yes. Stronger than the others by far. But maybe not that much stronger than a normal Human man. If she were better at fighting…\nBut he had two axes. And a bow and arrow. And he had levels, whatever that meant. He was a better fighter. And what did Erin have?\nShe looked around. She had an inn. She had a kitchen, the few supplies she’d bought from the city. She had a common room full of tables and chairs, an upstairs with no way out save through the windows. She had kitchen knives, pots, pans, and an empty fireplace.\nErin closed her eyes and thought. She opened them a minute later and knew.\nA horn blew somewhere in the distance\n. Erin listened to it and heard her heartbeat drowning out her thoughts. She knew what she had to do.\nErin got up. Her ears were ringing, but the world was silent. She felt like a dreamer, walking through a sleeping world. Even the blaring horn call sounded faint. In this moment, she felt like she had all the time in the world.\nSlowly, Erin walked into the kitchen. She bent and fished around in the bag of food she’d bought. There it was. Was it enough? It would be enough.\nErin looked around and picked up the cast iron cooking pot. It was small, but it would do.\nAll the embers in the kitchen’s fireplace had long since turned to ash. Erin tossed in a few pieces of wood and slowly bent to strike sparks. It was slow. The horn kept calling, louder and louder. But her hands never wavered. She was still dreaming.\nAt last, the fire caught. Erin fed the small blaze, and it grew slowly. She added enough wood and set the pot above the fire. It would be hot soon enough. The fire was growing.\nThat was it. Erin filled the pot to the brim with the item she’d taken from the shopping bag. Then she put the lid on the pot. Slowly, she walked back into the main room of the inn. And sat down.\nThe horn blew\n. It was from right outside the inn. Erin heard the Goblin’s heavy footsteps now, the rattle of his metal armor. He paused before the door.\nThud\n.\nThe door rattled. The chairs and tables blocking it moved from the force of the impact. Erin stared at the door.\n“It’s all just a game.”\nShe whispered to herself. She didn’t believe it.\nThud\n.\nAnother impact. This time, Erin heard cracking. The door wouldn’t last. She had seconds left.\nThud.\nThe fire was starting in the kitchen. It would take time to heat the pot. Was it enough? It would have to be enough.\nThud.\nThe entire door shook. Erin saw the wood splinter around the hinges. She waited. Death was in her bones. But whether it was hers, she didn’t know.\n“Knight to D4. Pawn to E3.”\nShe didn’t want to die. But it might be better than what came next. Erin closed her eyes.\n“I truly hate this world.”\nThe door crashed inwards, and the Goblin Chieftain stepped into the inn.\nRags\nby\nArtsyNada\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "It was a beautiful morning. The sky was deep blue, and the sun shone down pleasantly. The inn felt so quiet, only one panting, ragged breath could be heard. It smelled like mold and faint dust. The floorboards, worn smooth by age, were slick with sweat from Erin’s palms. For a second, it seemed so peaceful.\nThe front door had a single locking bar of wood on it. The stout door and the band of metal around it splintered inwards as something\nstruck\nit. Louder than she could imagine anything sounding. A\ncrash\nof wood. It barely lasted seconds as a second foot broke the rotted, weakened section of the door. A second—and the Goblin Chieftain burst through the door, charging into the inn.\nHis eyes were burning red orbs, swiveling as he lifted a pair of axes. He wore ragged fur armor, rusted chainmail, and he stood a head over the young woman, who flinched as he\nhowled.\nErin stood up and grabbed a chair, arms shaking so badly she could barely hold it up.\nThe Chieftain grinned as he whirled and spotted her. He glanced at the chair Erin was holding and then dismissed it. His eyes lingered on Erin. Her face, her body—she didn’t like the way he was looking at her.\nThere was worse than malice there. Hatred. All the intent in the world. Hatred and a shaking rage. Erin hesitated. The chair was in her hands, and she’d raised it to throw. The Goblin Chieftain was looking at her with all these terrible things behind those eyes.\nBut why was water leaking down from the corners of his eyes? She spoke, the words escaping through the tightness in her chest, like a balloon filled to bursting with fear.\n“I don’t want to hurt—”\nThe Goblin Chieftain roared and charged Erin. So\nfast.\nHe put his shoulder down and hit her before she could even throw the chair. Erin barely felt the impact. She\ndid\nfeel it as she smashed through the table behind her. The chair she was holding flew out of her hands. She felt something in her body\ncrack\n.\nThe Goblin lifted one of his axes. Erin lay on the ground gaping like a fish. He swung down. She rolled left, and the axe splintered the floorboards.\nAway. Erin threw herself over another table and felt the other axe miss her by an inch. She picked up a chair and hurled it at the Goblin. He swatted it down with one armored hand contemptuously.\nThe table was between them. Erin tensed to dodge left or right, but the Chieftain grabbed the table and\npushed\n. He rammed the heavy table into Erin’s midsection like a cannonball and then\nflipped\nthe table.\nA wall of wood came up and crashed down on her. Erin lay under the table, stunned, until she felt a thick hand grab her by one ankle and drag her out.\nThe Goblin pulled Erin from under the table and laughed at her. She lay on her back, eyes unfocused. He pulled aside his loincloth and pulled her towards him. Erin looked up at him and felt horror beating in her chest. He bent down to rip her clothes off—\nShe kicked up, right at his groin, with all her strength.\nThe Goblin caught her leg easily. He grinned at her again. With his other hand, he grabbed her other leg—\nErin sat up. Her legs were caught, but her hands weren’t. She punched the dangling target right between the Goblin’s legs.\nHis eyes bulged, and the huge Goblin roared and threw her away. Erin tumbled over and got to her feet. He was clutching at his private parts. She grabbed a chair, and this time, she didn’t hesitate.\nErin brought the chair down on the Goblin’s head with a heavy\nthump\n. Once. Twice. Then the Goblin punched at her.\nShe saw the punch coming and tried to block with the chair. The Goblin’s fist smashed through the wood and knocked Erin off her feet again. She got up and felt her mouth filling with blood. The world was swimming crazily to one side. She had to…\nThe Chieftain picked up his axe, cursing her in a language she didn’t know. Erin scrambled away. She was near the kitchen.\nThe kitchen.\nShe dashed inside and slammed the door shut.\nThere. The pot was sitting over the fire, and black smoke was coming out of the lid. Erin reached for it and felt the burning heat. Gloves. There was a rolling pin on the counter but no gloves or oven mitts. Where were—\nThe door exploded inwards with a terrific\ncrash\n. Erin turned and saw the Goblin Chieftain. He lifted his hand again, a blurred gleam of metal—\nShe ducked. The axe whistled through the air and struck the wall. The second hand came up, and she swung the rolling pin. It\ncracked\nacross his face.\nHis nose broke. Erin felt it break, but she lifted the rolling pin and hit him again. His other axe dropped from his hand, clattering to the floor. Erin didn’t reach for it; her burning arms just lifted the rolling pin higher and brought it down.\nHit him.\nShe had to hit him while he was stunned. Blood rolled down his face as he stared at her. Hit him.\nHit—\nShk.\nSomething heavy hit Erin in the midriff and pushed her back. She stumbled back a bit and regained her footing. Something was weighing her down though. Something was…Erin looked down.\nA knife was sticking out of her stomach, just above her waist. Her kitchen knife that she used to gut the fish. It was too far on the left side. It wasn’t symmetrical. And it was in her. In her.\nErin tugged at the knife. It was stuck. She pulled and felt—the skin around her stomach tried to pull itself out with the knife. She clenched her stomach muscles and\npulled",

    "text": "The knife came out with another terrible tearing of flesh. Erin stared at the blood on the blade. She dropped it, and the knife fell with a heavy\nthump\nto the ground. It should have clattered.\nBlood. It was running from her stomach. Erin held her hand over the wound and tried to make it stop. But she was bleeding now, faster and faster. And the Goblin Chieftain was getting up.\n“————!”\nErin wasn’t making any words. It was just a half-choked scream. She stumbled towards the fireplace, pain tearing up her insides with each step.\nSmoke billowed from the pot. The contents boiled and spat at her. There was no time for gloves. She grabbed the pot by the handles.\nThe metal burned her. Erin screamed as her hands blistered and the skin burned away. The pain was unbearable. But she held the pot and turned.\nThe Chieftain was on his feet. He snarled at her through his broken nose and bloody face. He had the kitchen knife in his hands. He lunged at her.\nErin tossed the contents of the pot at the Goblin Chieftain. The boiling oil splashed the Goblin’s face and ran down his chest.\nHe screamed. The Chieftain dropped the kitchen knife and screamed so loud Erin went deaf. She dropped the cooking pot and stumbled away from him.\nShe held her shaking hands out. Already, her skin was burnt black and white in places. Large blisters were forming out of her ruined skin. But it was only half. Only half of the pain in the world.\nThe Goblin Chieftain clawed at his face and sank to the floor. He was screaming still, but the sound he made was so very small. She heard him choking. Screaming quietly in agony. She understood. There wasn’t enough sound in the world to convey it all, and the screaming would make the pain worse. But still, he had to scream, so he did it quietly.\nErin sat on the ground and stared at him. He lay on the floor, steam rising from a face running with oil and dripping skin. Erin was bleeding. The wound in her stomach bled without stopping. But her hands—\nThey weren’t the same. And the agony of both was too much to bear. So Erin forgot the pain. She stared at the Chieftain as he lay on the floor. He was smoking.\nParts of his face were sloughing off. The boiling oil had…melted him. He was still alive. But he was dying.\nErin heard him breathing. Short, sharp bursts and whimpered pain. He lay on the ground and did not move. The fight was over. She’d won.\nSlowly, Erin began to cry.",

    "text": "The girl sat in the ruined kitchen with the Goblin. Both were silent. One was dying. The other, dead inside.\nA haze of burned smoke filled the room. The smell of burnt flesh filled the air. Oil dripped off the counter, ran down across the floor and seeped into the cracks with the blood and flesh.\nEventually, the girl moved. Slowly, so slowly, she stood. Staggering, clutching at the hole in her stomach, she walked over to a large cloth bag filled with food. She picked up a kitchen knife lying on the ground.\nWith the knife, she began slicing the cloth bag apart. The pain as she tightened the bandages over her stomach nearly made her faint. Her fingers and palms bled, and the world grew black. But she gripped the bandages tightly and tied a knot.\nThen she looked behind her.\nA dark shape lay on the floor, still dying. Steam rose from what remained of a face. The odor of cooked meat hung heavy in the air, wrongly appetizing. A face of ruined green flesh charred black stared up at her. What remained of lips moved as a chest rose in short, labored breaths.\nThe girl still had the knife. She almost raised it, almost ran—and then she went to sit down next to the body. The oil was still hot enough to scald, but she barely felt it. She sat with the Goblin. He stared back, and she looked at what remained of his eyes. Hollow pits. Not enough of a face left to do anything but breathe.\nThe oil dripping down his face still looked like tears. Why was he crying?\nThe lips moved.\nDid he speak?\nOnly she knew.\nA dark shape lay on the floor. The girl sat with it and waited. In time, the breathing stopped.\nThrough the narrow window in the kitchen, the sun shone down amidst blue skies, a ray of light into the kitchen, filtering through smoke. It wasn’t even midday yet, and a cool breath blew down from the mountains, stirring across the inn and rattling some of the shutters.\nBut for that, the world was so silent.\nThe girl sat back against the counter and closed her eyes.

    "text": "His name was Klbkch. It was what the members of other species called him, at least. His true name was longer and hard to express with lips. So he thought of himself as Klbkch or sometimes ‘Klb’. It was important to have an easy, affable nickname.\nAt the moment, Klbkch was off-duty. He had signed out of the roster and added Relc’s name to the log as well. His partner never signed out, or if he did, he did it improperly. Therefore, Klbkch had long ago made it a practice to do it for Relc. It was important to do things properly.\nPropriety had gotten him this far. Propriety, an adherence to all the rules of Liscor, spoken and unspoken, and effort. A mountain of it.\nKlbkch nodded to the desk sergeant on the way out. She barely looked up, but growled a goodbye.\n“Thanks for dealing with those drunks, Klbkch. I owe you one.”\n“Not at all, Senior Guardswoman Beilmark.”\nAnd for that, she furnished him with a harried, grateful smile of a woman who had a family to get back to. These were salient details that Klbkch remembered, because they endeared him to people.\nThere was a time, not long ago, that he could remember when no one spoke to him when he became a [Guardsman]. When every eye was hostile or cautious.\nTen years ago seemed like both an age and a short time. Ten years…he wondered how much longer he’d do this. Another decade? A century?\nIf it were that long, he wondered if he would ever learn how to smile like they did. Not with their lips, but genuinely.\nIt didn’t matter. The cause was all. He should have gone straight back home, down, to the one street in Liscor where the ground opened up and no one but his kind went.\nDown, home to the Hive.\nBut instead, for once, Klbkch walked to the eastern gates. He passed by the [Guards], who straightened guiltily and then looked relieved that he was off-duty. He waved at the ones on the walls and then began to walk.\nKlbkch walked through the dark grassland outside of the city, up rolling hills, head swiveling for monsters, but with little fear. He moved fast, in a continual stride, for he did not have all the time in the world. Once he was done here, he needed to conduct his work below, in his Hive. Six hours…and then he might sleep for four and get back to work. Depending on how long he took right now, he might sleep for two hours. Or one.\nHe was headed to the inn where a young Human female currently resided. Klbkch wondered why he was wasting his time doing this. It was not part of his duties as a guardsman. Relc had refused to go, citing some complaint he’d had with Erin, an argument.\nYet Klbkch went. He told himself he was visiting her to improve his relationship with her. It was important to maintain good relationships with other species. But she was hardly important; Humans were not well-liked in Liscor, and she had no capital, social or economic. So why?\nMaybe because she had never mentioned The Black Tide. She had never met an Antinium and when she smiled, there was no\nedge\nbehind it. She was guileless, possibly naive. He was only going to check in on her and have a drink.\nKlbkch knew something was wrong when he saw the smoke in the distance. It wasn’t visible from Liscor’s walls, but he saw it once he got within a few miles of the inn, a thin line of smoke coming out one window. Not from the chimney. And the door of the inn wasn’t closed either, but ajar.\nEven in his ruined form, his eyes had been made to spot details at a distance, and Klbkch noted how the door hung in\npieces.\nInstantly, Klbkch drew the two swords at his waist. He had two more hands free, but he left them unarmed for now.\nSwords at the ready, Klbkch charged up the slight incline towards the inn. He moved extremely quickly—his long legs combined with his levels in the [Guardsman] class that gave him [Enhanced Movement], which turned the several miles into a blur behind him.\nThe inn was leaking black smoke out of the back windows. Klbkch knew they were connected to the kitchen. The door smashed in, and as Klbkch approached, he saw a crowd of monsters clustering around the windows.\nGoblins.\nThe instant they saw him running at them, they turned and fled, running for the base of the mountains. Klbkch debated cutting them down for a second—then he turned to the interior. If she was anywhere—\nKlbkch stopped outside of the inn and flattened himself against one wall next to the entrance. He drew his two daggers with his lower set of hands and braced himself, listening. He did not underestimate or overestimate his chances.\nAs a [Guardsman], he was the fourth in order of levels in the entire city of Liscor. His other talents put him in the top three fighters in the entire Watch day by day. Once, it wouldn’t have been a competition. He was capable of handling most Goblin varieties, but if he was outnumbered, he would retreat.\nHis goal was to assess the whereabouts and well-being of Erin Solstice and, if possible, escape with her. If not, his job was to witness her fate and the forces currently occupying the inn.\nFor some reason, Erin Solstice mattered to Klbkch more than assessing the threat at the moment. He dismissed that thought instantly and questioned his judgment. His survival outweighed a single Human’s. He should fall back and summon a Watch patrol.\nBut.\nShe could be inside, wounded or dying at the hands of the Goblins at this moment. Klbkch was well-aware of their tendency to rape and assault females of any humanoid race. He heard nothing.\nHis instincts told him to wait, that it was too late. Klbkch ignored them. His mind was telling him to act. He charged through the door, ready for anything.\nThe common room of the inn was a mess of broken tables and chairs. Klbkch swept the room. Empty. The door to the kitchen was broken in. He raced into the kitchen. And stopped.\nTwo figures lay on the ground. One was a Goblin. Not just any Goblin; a Chieftain. A Hobgoblin. A true danger and threat. The other was a Human girl. Both were lying still.\nThe air smelled of smoke and oil. Burnt flesh.\nKlbkch assessed the situation. The Goblin Chieftain was a great threat. He could be killed if necessary, but—he was already dead. Dead. A threat capable of wiping out low-level parties of adventurers by himself had been killed by…a girl?\nHow? But that didn’t matter. He looked at Erin Solstice. Then he heard the rasping sound.\nThe young woman lay against a kitchen counter. She held a bandage to her stomach with her arm. Her hands were blistered and blackened. Tears had painted clear lines through the soot on her face. Red-black blood had dried around the bandage on her stomach. Her eyes barely fluttered as he knelt beside her.\nShe was barely breathing.\nFor once in his long life, Klbkch of the Free Antinium had no idea what to say.\n“Ah. Miss Solstice?”",

    "text": "The pain had left after a while. Erin floated in a dark, warm sea by herself. She was falling asleep. Or maybe she was asleep and just dreaming.\nErin slowly sank into slumber as the light of the world faded away. It was a wonderful feeling as she gave up her burdens and closed her eyes. Sleep. It had been so long since she’d slept properly.\nBut there was something bothering her. Something…was making a sound? Yes, a sound. Erin squeezed her eyes shut, but now she was being shaken. She didn’t want to wake up. But maybe if she did, she could go back to sleep. She listened.\n“Miss Solstice? Miss Solstice, you must drink.”\nShe was waking up. And with the waking came pain. Erin groaned, or tried to. Her throat was terribly dry. She hurt. She hurt so much that she couldn’t bear the pain. She didn’t know what to do. She wanted to go back to sleep, but the voice was insistent.\n“Drink.”\nSomething was at her lips. Cool glass and a wet feeling. Erin felt cool liquid pressing forwards and licked instinctively.\nAt once, something wonderful began happening. Just as her tongue tasted bitter foulness and she gagged, the pain went away. For a second.\nThen it was back. Desperately, Erin opened her mouth and tasted the disgusting, wonderful drink again. It was bitter and had some terrible taste like a mix of the worst medications combined with what she thought bugs might taste like. Yet with each gulp, the pain lessened, and the burning agony in her stomach fled, piece by piece. The terrible\nnumbness\nin her hands vanished, replaced by pain, tingling, and then a sense of incredible normality.\nErin opened her eyes and sat up. Energy flooded back into her body, and the darkness of death receded. She looked up and saw a giant insectoid face staring down at her.\n“Guh.”\nErin choked on the last mouthful of the healing potion. Klbkch held her steady as she gulped it down and swallowed. His mandibles clacked as he spoke, and a tiny ‘mouth,’ more like an opening between the mandibles, opened and closed, producing the staccato voice. Staccato, but intent, worried.\n“Miss Solstice. Are you well?”\n“I—I’m alive.”\nErin stammered. She looked at Klbkch. He was holding the empty potion bottle in his hand.\nHe had saved her.\nBrought her back from death. She wanted to thank him. She didn’t have the words, but she wanted to thank him for saving her. She opened her mouth and then saw the body lying on the floor.\nThe Goblin Chieftain. Her eyes fell on his ruined face, on his motionless body. Erin paused and ignored Klbkch’s repeated questions. For a while, she just stared at the body until Klbkch dragged it out of the kitchen. When he returned and she looked back into his face, she’d completely forgotten what she wanted to say.",

    "text": "“You are not from here, are you, Miss Solstice?”\nThat was the first thing Klbkch said to her after he’d made sure she was well.\nErin lay against the kitchen cupboards, her shirt lifted up as she inspected her stomach. It was perfectly healed, although the bandage was still there. She would have felt uneasy about undressing in front of Klbkch but—she wasn’t. It was probably because he was an insect.\nShe looked up in surprise. Klbkch was staring at her. She didn’t know what to say. He, however, did.\n“I do not mean this country or even this continent. You are not from\nhere\n, are you?”\nKlbkch squatted next to her. His back-shell actually rested on the ground, making it an easy position for him. He was incapable of lying on his back, and she wondered how he slept. Erin shook her head slowly.\n“No. I’m not.”\n“I thought as much.”\nErin smiled bloodlessly. She felt so tired, but sleep was as impossible as anything else, so she talked. She gazed at the insect-man’s face, and he was the most reassuring, normal thing this day. She tried to shrug and gave up halfway.\n“Was it obvious?”\n“Say rather that it has become obvious. It is an unbelievable statement, but it is the only one I can come to.”\nErin hesitated and then nodded. Klbkch nodded in agreement.\n“How’d you figure it out?”\nHe raised a hand and began to tick off points on his fingers.\n“Many clues lead me to this conclusion. Your curiosity about levels and classes, your mysterious arrival, and this ‘Michigan,’ which is no nation recorded in any book or map. But most of all, it was this last moment. No Human would weep for a Goblin.”\nErin brushed at her face. Her tears were long dried but—\n“Really? No one? What about Drakes?”\n“No Human. No Drake or Gnoll, Selphid, Dullahan, Beastkin, or any creature from this world would.”\n“What about your people?”\nKlbkch didn’t blink. He couldn’t. But he did twitch. His antennae, above his head, moved erratically then settled down.\n“The Antinium? We do not weep.”\n“Oh. I see.”\nErin felt Klbkch’s hands moving at her side. He was peeling away the sticky bandage.\n“Ow. What was—”\n“Worry not. The healing potion worked. The bandage has stuck to your skin.”\n“Oh—\now!\nGood to know.”\n“You will be weak for at least a day afterwards. However, you will recover in full. You are lucky; there was no infection that the healing potion could have exacerbated.”\nErin yelped as a bit of skin came off with the rest of the bandage.\n“Good. Thank you. So. What now? Did you—what did you do with the body?”\n“I buried it outside. Far from the inn, in pieces, to prevent chance reanimation. Worry not.”\n“…Thank you. Um. Thank you.”\nKlbkch nodded. He quickly and deftly folded the dirty bandage and added it to the fire he’d lit. It smelled terribly, but that was just one burned odor among many in the kitchen at the moment.\nThen the ant man went to check on the small pot he’d set over the stove. It was filled with boiling water, not oil. After a minute, he dipped another piece of cloth into the pot and brought it over to Erin. She accepted it wordlessly and used it to sponge off dried dirt, blood, and other stains from her skin.\n“I had made the observation that you were not from this world, Miss Solstice.”\n“Yeah. I changed the subject. Humans do that when they don’t want to talk about something.”\nShe scrubbed violently at her stomach. The towel was quite hot, but the heat was welcome. She felt cold. Klbkch bowed his head as he watched her.\n“Then you have a commonality with many non-Antinium species. My apologies. I should not be asking such questions now. You are still in shock.”\nErin looked up.\n“I’m not in shock.”\n“You are still suffering from this encounter. Your mental state is unbalanced.”\n“I’m not in shock. I’m really not. I’m just—tired.”\nKlbkch bowed his head again.\n“As you say.”\n“I’m okay. Really. I just—I’m from somewhere else. Another world. This place is different. I just—I just don’t want to talk about it right now. It’s been a bad day.”\n“Of course. Forgive my rudeness. But if I may, I would like to suggest a course of action.”\n“Um. Okay?”\n“I have disposed of the Goblin Chieftain’s body. However, there are many Goblins still hiding nearby. If you feel safe here, I will dispose of as many as I can. If not, I will escort you to the city and then return with reinforcements to—”\n“No.”\nErin cut Klbkch off. She sensed the Antinium’s surprise.\n“No? If you feel unable to travel, I can—”\n“No. No killing Goblins.”\nHe paused. She could sense him looking at her even though his multifaceted eyes had no pupils. Klbkch seemed baffled, and his mandibles opened and closed several times, like someone opening and closing their mouth.\n“May I ask why not?”\n“It’s wrong.”\n“Many would argue otherwise, Miss Solstice. Goblins are considered monsters and bandits for the purposes of determining crime under Liscorian law. They are killers who prey on the weak. You have nearly died at the hands of one.”\nErin nodded.\n“They’re vicious, evil little monsters. And they’d probably eat me if they could.”\n“Undoubtedly.”\n“And they’re murderers.”\n“This is true. Over a quarter of the deaths of travellers on the roads around Liscor are due to Goblin attacks. They are murderers.”\n“Yeah.”\nErin mumbled. She stared at her hands. Her clean, whole hands.\n“They’re murderers. And so am I. Don’t kill them.”\nSilence followed her last remark. Erin stared at her hands. At last, Klbkch’s staccato voice sounded next to her ear.\n“I do not understand your reasoning. But I will accede to your request. Know that I will defend myself with lethal force if attacked, however.”\n“That’s fine. They’re gone, anyways. They ran off when they heard him screaming.”\n“Very well then.”\nKlbkch fell silent. Erin stared at the spot where the body had lain. She felt lightheaded. At some point, she felt she should have clung to Klbkch and started crying. Or was that too stereotypical? Was it a normal reaction? But instead, she just felt a bit—empty.\n“One more thing.”\n“Is there something you wish to ask of me, Miss Solstice?”\nErin nodded vaguely. She pointed at her chest. It was still bare. Oops. She pulled her shirt down. Good thing her bra was still on.\n“After I killed the Goblin—I gained a new skill. Two, actually. [Bar Fighting] and [Unerring Throw].”\n“They are worthy skills. Unusual for the [Innkeeper] class, but not unheard of.”\n“Really? Why’d I get them? And aren’t skills like…set?”\n“Another sign you do not belong to this world, Miss Solstice.”\nErin looked up with a frown. Klbkch waved one hand.\n“I mean no offense. It is simply that all beings know how classes and skills work.”\n“Well then, explain it to me.”\nKlbkch was silent for a few seconds.\n“To put it simply, classes are general ways of life that individuals take. In life, one might choose to become a [Butcher], or perhaps a [Musician]. It is simply a matter of fulfilling the requirements. Often, they are known, but there are exceptions. One cannot simply take [Ruler]-type classes for instance.”\n“Right, you’ve got to be born into it.”\n“That is indeed one of the ways to learn such a class. But in any case, classes increase one’s proficiency at their role with each new level. And with that increase in ability, Skills may be learnt. But there is no one set of Skills for a class.”\n“Really?”\n“Indeed not. Two individuals taking the [Soldier] class, for instance, may learn different Skills at the same level. It is a matter of need and inclination which allows individuals to learn skills. For instance, while Relc is a higher-level warrior than I, he is not of a higher level in the actual [Guardsman] class and thus does not possess the [Detect Guilt] skill.”\n“Okay.”\nKlbkch looked at Erin. She shrugged.\n“Do you understand?”\n“Not really. Sort of. I guess? But why are there levels in the first place?”\n“It is the way of the world. All races that think are given the ability to level and take classes.”\n“By who?”\nErin sighed and slapped her face lightly.\n“Or whom. Who did it? And why?”\n“It is not known. But our oldest texts tell us of this truth.”\nKlbkch recited in his inflectionless voice:\n“All those that Think—Feel. From Feeling do we Act. It is in Action that we Level. All those who Think have a Class. And it is in that Class which we find destiny.”\nErin snorted. Then she realized he was being serious.\n“Did someone teach you that?”\nKlbkch nodded gravely.\n“It is part of the lessons any child learns. The exact wording comes from a book:\nThe Book of Levels\n, which was originally written nearly twenty thousand years ago. Copies of this text are among the few mainstream works that have been faithfully reproduced into this age. I have studied it extensively upon coming to this continent to understand the mentality of the peoples here, as well as levels and classes in general.”\n“But\nwhy\nis that how things work?”\nErin was getting frustrated. Klbkch’s calm, matter-of-fact tone wasn’t helping matters either. This time, his pause took longer, and she thought he sounded vaguely exasperated.\n“It is simply how we live our life. This is a universal truth throughout the world. Is yours not the same?”\nErin scowled at him.\n“No, it’s not. We don’t have levels, and we don’t learn Skills like we’re in a video game. We don’t have classes except for ones in school, and we don’t need levels to learn things.”\n“Learning skills is not merely a matter of levels. Classes and leveling are simply the basis of our lives so we may grow faster from what we do. It is a fact of life.”\n“That’s stupid.”\nHe looked at her in surprise.\n“I beg your pardon?”\n“Your leveling is stupid. Your skills are stupid. I hate your world’s classes, I hate your city, and I hate\nyou.\n”\nShe shouted those last words at Klbkch and then buried her face in her hands. After a while, she felt him place a comforting hand on her shoulder. It was cold, smooth exoskeleton. But it was still comforting.\n“…I didn’t mean that.”\n“I took no offense, Miss Solstice. I realize you have gone through a traumatic event. The fault lies with me for not being more receptive to your distress. I should have provided more comfort and companionship. In that, my partner Relc is occasionally more effective than I.”\n“You’re fine.”\nErin mumbled that through her tears. She’d begun crying. Not bad crying or loud crying, but her eyes were suddenly filled with tears.\n“I’m just having a bad—I mean, it’s been—I hate this world. But I didn’t mean that last bit about you. You’re okay. Everyone else can go to hell.”\n“I see. It is a long way to Rhir. Here. Please accept this.”\nKlbkch handed Erin another piece of cloth. She blew her nose and sniffed loudly.\n“I’d like to be alone now.”\nKlbkch hesitated.\n“I will remain here with your permission. It would be unwise to—”\nShe cut him off.\n“I’ll be fine.”\n“Respectfully, I must disagree. Though the Goblin Chieftain is dead, his tribe may seek vengeance.”\n“They won’t.”\n“May I ask how you know?”\n“I just know. Please. I’d really like to be left alone.”\nAgain, he hesitated, but at last, Klbkch stood up. He walked over to the door of the kitchen. There he turned.\n“One last question, Miss Solstice, if I may? What caused the Goblin Chieftain to attack you in the first place? It is rare that the tribal leader takes any aggressive action if unprovoked.”\nErin closed her eyes. She felt so tired. And the events of…was it this morning? They felt so long ago.\n“Relc. He killed two Goblins and beheaded them.”\nKlbkch paused. Out of the corner of her eye, Erin saw him close one of his four hands. Then he bowed deeply.\n“Allow me to apologize on both our behalves. Words cannot express my shame.”\nShe nodded shortly.\n“It’s okay.”\nThe lie said, she waited for Klbkch to leave. When he didn’t leave after a few minutes, she looked directly at him.\n“I’m going to sleep.”\nHe nodded.\n“Well then. Take care, Miss Solstice.”\nThe Antinium didn’t close the door since the door was broken. But he did prop it against the hole in the wall with two chairs. That done, the ant man disappeared into the grasslands, quickly becoming a silhouette against the orange sky.\nErin put her head against the wall. Her eyes were burning, and her body felt slow and fuzzy after the healing potion. At last, he was gone. It wasn’t that she didn’t want his company. In fact, she wanted to hold him or maybe him to hold her. But she wanted to sleep now. To forget.\nBut she couldn’t sleep.\nShe wanted to sleep badly. Her mind was crying out for her to close her eyes. But when she did, she saw things. So she kept them open.\nShe smelled the burned oil and burning flesh still. Klbkch had opened a window, and an evening breeze was blowing through the kitchen. But she still smelled death. She still saw it in the Goblin Chieftain’s eyes. He was looking right at her—\nThump\n.\nErin smacked her head against the wall behind her. It hurt. She did it again.\nThump\n.\nThump.\nThe image of the dead Goblin’s eyes disappeared for a second. But the instant she thought about them, they were back, staring into her soul.\nThump.\nErin bumped her head again. The pain made the vision fade briefly. It also made her head swim. Still, if she had to choose between that and the Goblin’s—\nThump. Thump. Thump.\nShe wanted to sleep, but couldn’t. And the night was coming. With it came uncertainty, fear, but worst of all was that one thing she couldn’t escape.\nMemory.\nThump.",

    "text": "Klbkch walked through Liscor’s eastern gates and nodded at the Drake on duty. He received no reply from the weary Drake, but made no comment. Politeness was important. Fostering strong ties and goodwill towards the Antinium within the city was important.\nWhat was also important was turning in a bounty. Klbkch had a large cloth bag he’d fashioned out of what remained of Erin Solstice’s shopping bag, and it was weighing down his left side by quite a bit. But the bag was necessary, and besides, it kept the smell and sight from disturbing the other civilians he passed.\nYes, the bounty. He would fill it out tonight at the Adventurer’s Guild. But before that, he had another mission that took higher precedence.\nKlbkch walked through the streets until he came to a bar he knew was frequented by many Drake customers. It was a loud, raucous joint filled with many reptilian bodies, but they made room for him. Not out of respect for his occupation—he was off-duty—but out of a desire not to touch him.\nThe lone Antinium walked through the crowd of Drakes until he heard his name being loudly called and the\nsmash\nof a tankard being hurled his way.\n“Oi, Klb! You won’t believe what that stupid Human did this time.”\nKlbkch approached Relc from across the bar. The Drake waved him over to a seat and turned unsteadily. He was with a gaggle or, as the proper term was,\ncluster\nof Drakes. Some were male; the majority were female. Or not. Gender was still difficult for Klbkch to ascertain at the best of times.\n“Good thing you’re here. Let me tell you, that Erin girl? Stupidest Human I’ve ever met. Do you know what she did this morning?”\nRelc didn’t wait for a response, but launched into his story. By the looks on the others’ faces, this was not his first retelling. Klbkch ignored Relc and ignored the seat the Drake was trying to shove him into. He was clearly inebriated.\nKlbkch placed one of his hands on Relc’s shoulders to steady him. Proper posture was critical. Relc grinned at him.\n“Hey, what’s gotten into you, Klb? Decided to take me up on a night out for once? Pull up a seat.”\nHe turned his head as Klbkch put the other hand on Relc’s other shoulder, and the Drake gave him a quizzical glance. Then Klbkch hit Relc with his other two hands as hard as he could.\nThe Drake saw the punches coming, but he was too drunk to dodge properly, and Klbkch’s hands held him in place. He smacked into the floor hard as both punches caught him in the jaw and stomach at the same time.\nFor a moment, all was stunned silence. Then Klbkch heard a loud\nhiss\nthat turned into a screeching bellow of rage.\nRelc surged to his feet with a roar and caught Klbkch’s foot while coming up. The blow smashed him in the jaw again and this time stunned him for a few seconds. Klbkch nodded to himself. Proper posture was critical for a good strike. Relc was a fine warrior, but he was drunk, and this was a surprise attack.\nRelc lay at Klbkch’s feet. He got back up, received two more punches again, and decided to lie down. Klbkch nodded to himself and walked away from his partner.\nThe atmosphere in the room had turned hostile. Klbkch glanced around but decided not to draw his daggers. The other male Drakes were glowering and clenching their clawed hands, but experience told him that they would not attack unless he made further provocations.\nKlbkch estimated the public perception towards Antinium within the city had lowered a degree from his actions, regardless of the reasons. Antipathy within the City Guard might also be substantial, at least in the short term.\nIt was a costly consequence, but it struck Klbkch as fitting. He nodded to the silent bar of onlookers.\n“Good night to you. Please accept my apologies for the inconvenience. I shall take my leave.”\nKlbkch turned and walked out of the bar. He heard the hubbub start as soon as he’d left, mixed in with Relc’s indignant and distinctive voice. Oh yes. There would be consequences tomorrow.\nFor some reason, that didn’t bother Klbkch. Instead, he wondered what Humans were like. Were they anything like Drakes? He had only seen them on the other side of a battlefield or rare visitors to Liscor. They had not been like Erin.\nBut the night was deepening, and he still had a bounty to turn in. The proper forms needed to be filled out, and an eyewitness account delivered. Things had to be done properly or not at all.\nKlbkch walked into the night. There was a bounty to fill out and research on Humans to be done. But most importantly, his Queen must know of a Human named Erin Solstice. She was important. She was…unique.",

    "text": "Erin sat in a chair and stared outside. It was a lovely day. A warm breeze floated through the window, warming all it touched.\nExcept for her. She felt cold. Cold and empty.\nShadows passed before her. They had names. Klbkch, Relc, even Pisces. But they weren’t important. The dead were far worse.\nErin held a Goblin’s head in her hands. She stared into its blank eyes and felt her hands burning. She sat next to a dying Goblin and listened to him breathing.\nThe sun was bright. At some point, the night had turned to day. But Erin still felt as if it were night. In the inn, the shadows were long and kept her in darkness. It was only fitting.\nThe world felt hollow. Everything echoed, and the surroundings blurred gently around Erin as she sat. She wasn’t doing anything in particular. She was just existing. Existing and not fitting in.\nA little ghost in a little inn in a little world. That’s what she felt like.\nIt was cold. Not physically; at some point, someone had put a blanket on her and left some tea that had grown chilly, untouched. Had that been Pisces? Surely not.\nErin looked up. Relc was in the inn. Was it the first time she’d seen him today? Probably. He was yelling about Goblins and apologizing. Klbkch was there. Silent. His brown carapace blended in with the chairs. Maybe he’d been here all day. Erin couldn’t remember.\n“—kill all of the little bastards!”\nRelc was shouting. He grabbed his spear. Erin’s hand moved.\n“\nWhoa!\n”\nRelc’s head jerked back as a kitchen knife flashed past his face. The blade\nthudded\ninto a wall and lodged in the wood.\nKlbkch and Relc stared at Erin. She stared at her hand silently. Oh. Right. A skill. [Unerring Throw]. Had she talked to Klbkch about it yesterday? Or was she going to talk to him in the future about it?\nShe looked up at Relc.\n“Leave them alone.”\nThen Erin went back to staring at her hands. After a while, Relc left. Klbkch left too, or maybe Erin just stopped seeing him.\n“This is my inn. I make the rules here. And if you don’t like my rules, get out.”\nDid she say that to Relc or the empty inn? Maybe she screamed it. Erin couldn’t remember. Time wasn’t the same anymore. She just stared at her hands and felt her flesh burning. She saw the dead Goblin lying on the floor, screaming quietly.\nIt was all she saw.\nPisces came later. He ran in with sparks shooting from his fingertips. He was like Relc. But he cared. He wanted to kill Goblins too, or maybe just scare them away. Place a curse on them. It didn’t matter.\nErin stared at him until he flinched and looked away. She gave him one of the dried sausages. She told him if he killed a Goblin, then she’d kill him.\nHe took the sausage and turned white when she told him she’d kill him. Then he put the blanket over her and left.\nErin sat in the inn and felt the walls closing in. She couldn’t breathe in there. So she went outside.\nThe sun was too beautiful, and the sky was too bright. Erin went back inside and felt the darkness crawling up her spine. The shadows were moving. The wind sounded like whispers.\nShe heard breathing. It was hers.\nIt was dark. At some point, the sun went down. That was the worst time. Erin saw dead things lying in the shadows. The bodies of Goblins lay underneath tables; their heads sat in the moonlight filtering in from the windows.\nErin shut her eyes. But they followed her inside her head. They dug around her mind and pulled out memories. Then they tore apart her heart. Piece by piece, until morning came.",

It was noon. Of tomorrow. That was probably why she felt hungry.\nShe began walking. It was hard. Her legs didn’t want to keep her upright. Twice, Erin tripped and fell over. But she got up and walked on. Walking was hard, but it wasn’t nearly as hard as other things.",

    "text": "The orchard was just as she’d left it. The unnaturally straight, stiff trees still bore the bright blue fruits. Erin kicked one tree and caught the fruit as it fell towards her face.\nFor a while, she sat on the ground and stared at the fruit. The trees provided her with shade; the wind blew her hair back into her face. Eventually, Erin bit into the fruit and ate.\nIt was sweet and delicious. The juice was cool and refreshing. Erin tasted ash and dust. Mechanically, she finished the fruit and ate five more. Then she threw up.\nOnce she was done, Erin ate another fruit. It helped with the taste. Then she stared at the mess of fruit and the stained seed core in her hands.\nShe cracked open the seed core and stared at the pulpy mess inside. Poison. It was probably a really painful way to die. The smell was terrible. It would probably taste terrible.\nPoison was a terrible way to die. Almost as bad as melting your face off.\nThump\n.\nThump\n.\nErin smacked her head against the tree. It was nice and hard. The blue fruits showered down around her.\nThump. Thump. Thump.\nShe stopped when she saw the Goblins. They were standing at the edge of the orchard, four of them. They fled the instant her eyes fell on them.\nOne of the Goblins dropped something in its panic. Erin walked over and picked up the small basket made of twigs. It wasn’t very good.\nShe turned and looked at the orchard. Fruit trees. Of course. They were probably hungry too. She couldn’t see them eating the rock crabs, and the dino birds would probably eat them if they tried to steal their eggs. Aside from the occasional traveller, what else could Goblins eat?\nErin left the orchard. She walked back to the inn slowly, feeling her body gradually collapsing on itself. She probably needed to eat more. But it was too much work.\nShe sensed them following her. When she looked around, they fled. But they were slow, and she caught glimpses of them. Ragged clothes. Thin bodies. They looked like starving children, refugees from a war. Not like monsters. Except for the teeth and red eyes.\nThat gave Erin an idea. She stared at her hands for a moment and then picked up the pace. Suddenly, she was walking faster. When she got to the inn, she looked for the shopping bag and found Klbkch had stored all the ingredients away on the counter. It was very hard to start the fire. But when she’d started, it was easier than stopping.\nErin smelled smoke and burning. But only burning wood and not so much smoke. Mainly, she just heard breathing. And her stomach rumbling.",

    "text": "Evening fell upon the plains, upon the lone inn on the small hilltop, and upon the four Goblins skulking in the tall grass. They watched the inn. They watched the smoke rising from the chimney. They watched and heard their stomachs rumbling.\nAll of them had weapons. Not good ones; rusty blades and crude clubs. But they were dangerous.\nEven so, they feared the inn. They feared the one that lived inside it. A trickster. A deceiver. A destroyer. She looked weak, but she was death. A burning death. Burning, melting death. A terrible way to go, even by their low standards.\nThey knew that. But still, they smelled something wonderful coming from the inn. Food. And they were so very hungry.\nThe inn had closed shutters, but they could still smell something wafting from the inside. It didn’t smell like rotted meat or the foulness inside the blue death fruits. It didn’t even smell like the dead, half-rotted animals they sometimes found on a lucky day. It smelled\ngood\n.\nThey salivated. But they feared the inn. And they had to eat tonight or starve. So, reluctantly, they tore themselves away. They had hoped the Human female would drop some food or fall down dead. Since she did neither, they had to find other food.\nStill, they hesitated. They lingered outside the door and wished they had the numbers or strength to steal the food. But the monster inside was death. She had killed the Chieftain, and so she could not be fought. It was death.\nStill, they hungered.\nThe littlest Goblin had no more thoughts than that. Three Goblins were dead, now. The Chieftain, two more…their tribe might end here, before the snow came. That knowledge did not hurt her.\nIt just was. Her curiosity about the Human was gone. She saw everything clearly now. The Human female was death, a different kind than the Drake or the bug-person, but death nonetheless. She was hungry and empty and…and she wondered if the Human had any knives. She needed a sharp knife. Or she would die like the Chieftain.\nThe littlest Goblin’s gaze was empty, but like the other four Goblins, she wavered, debating, silently, whether or not she could steal a morsel from the inn. She was so hungry without the Chieftain to make sure everyone had a tiny bit of something or to kill one of the deer or something else like a few spiders.\nHow long did they stand outside the front door, drooling? Too long. The door slammed open.\nThe Goblins cried out in fear and turned to run. But the Deceiver didn’t chase them. She stood in the doorway of the inn, hands on her hips. She raised one eyebrow.\n“Well? Come on in.”\nThe Deceiver turned and walked back inside. The Goblins exchanged a glance and stared at the open door. A good smell came from inside. They hesitated.\nThe littlest Goblin knew this might be her death. It would be just like the Human to kill them like the Chieftain. But the smell was so delicious. She clutched at her stomach, which was so beyond empty it now began to feel full. If she died, she wanted a bite of whatever that smell was. One bite, just one in her entire life. Her feet carried her forwards as the others hissed at her.\nSo, so delicious.",

    "text": "Erin turned as the first Goblin finally crept into the inn. He froze in place, but she pointed to a table.\n“There. Sit.”\nHe…hesitated, and then scampered over to the chair. Erin thought it was a he. It was almost impossible to tell.\nThe Goblin awkwardly perched on the oversized chairs as Erin placed a plate on the table. Or was it she? They flinched with her every move. When she pulled out the forks, the tiny Goblin nearly bolted. But they sat up and stared as she brought the pot into the room.\nThe metal was still burning hot. But Erin used her t-shirt to protect her hands and carried the pot to the table. She picked up a pair of tongs and began dropping buttered pasta mixed with sausage and onions onto each plate.\nThe Goblin salivated. They stared at the golden pasta and up at Erin with wide-eyed wonder. They reached for the pasta with dirty fingers and hesitated. The tiny little Goblin stared up at Erin.\nShe stared back. Her eyes travelled to the Goblin’s fingers, which were scooting beneath the plate.\n“Steal my stuff and I’ll hit you with a chair. Sit. Eat.”\nThe Goblin snatched their fingers back instantly. They stared at the pasta and then up at Erin. She wondered why the Goblin wasn’t eating. Oh. Of course.\n“The first meal is on the house.”\nThe Goblin looked up at the ceiling. Erin sighed, but her lips twitched.\n“That means it’s free.”\nAgain, the Goblin stared at her. This time in wide-eyed wonder.\n“Eat.”\nA hand reached for the pasta.\n“Not like that.”\nThe Goblin snatched his hand back and nearly tumbled out of the chair. Erin sighed again. This time, she was smiling a bit.\n“Eat with a fork. See this? Fork.”\nShe pointed to a fork. The Goblin stared at it. Slowly, the tiny figure picked it up. The Goblin inspected it, turning it around and understood how to use it, but admired the tiny tines. Then, gingerly, he speared one buttered noodle and slowly transferred it to his mouth. It hung over the open mouth full of yellowed teeth as he stared at her. Asking for permission.\nErin nodded. The noodle fell. The Goblin gulped and went very still. Deathly still.\nThen he smiled. It was a terrible smile, full of sharp crooked teeth and hesitation. But it was a smile.\nErin smiled back. She laughed for the first time in ages. It was a laugh that came straight out of her feet and through her heart. It exploded out of her chest. It was a good laugh, and it made the world right again.\nThe Goblin looked at the laughing Human. The little Goblin put down his fork and ran out the door, screaming. It only made her laugh harder.",

Erin made no move to stop them.\nAwkwardly, they wandered towards the door, still staring at her. Then one stopped and nudged the others. They clustered together, backs towards her. Erin saw something flash in their palms. The hairs on the back of her neck rose, but she remained seated.\nOne of the Goblins came back. It was holding something in its hands. It held it out to her.\nErin stared down at the three small, tarnished silver coins in the Goblin’s cupped hands. She blinked. Once. Twice. Then she let go of the chair and stood up.\nThe Goblin flinched, but Erin moved very slowly. She reached out and touched the Goblin’s hands. They were rough, dirty, and warm. She closed them over the coins.\n“The first meal is free.”\nThe Goblin stared at her. She stared back. It turned and fled. But it stopped at the door and said something. It sounded like ‘\nsqwsmsch\n.’ Then it was gone.\nErin sat back down and stared at the door. She blinked a few times and then smiled. She stared around at the inn and wiped at her eyes. Then she pulled the chair in to the table and put her arms down for a pillow.\nShe was asleep the instant her head touched the table.\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "Erin woke up slowly. She woke up to the sight of a bag full of money on her table. For a moment, she thought the Goblin had left it.\nIt wasn’t the Goblin. In fact, the mysterious bag full of silver coins was courtesy of Klbkch. Erin peered down at the note he’d written and squinted to make out the words. To her amazement, it was legible, if slightly smudgy English! Even cursive?\nFor the destruction of a Hobgoblin Chieftain within the area of Liscor, you are hereby awarded 12 gold and 14 coins of silver, or equivalent in lesser denominations. Signed and witnessed by Senior Guardsman Klbkch.\n—Senior Guardsman Klbkch\nPost Script: Please excuse my poor handwriting, but I am not fluent in the script used by most Humans on this continent.\nErin peered down at the bag. She opened it and blinked at the sight of all the gleaming silver and gold.\nGold.\nFor a while, she stared at the shiny metal and watched as the sunlight made it glow. Then she closed the bag.\nShe gazed at the table. The money seemed like it was right out of a dream. But it didn’t actually matter much to her at the moment.\nShe looked back at the table. Had she dreamed that too? But no, she saw where the Goblin had spilled the blue fruit juice when she’d smiled at it. A large glowing fly was hovering over the table.\nErin sighed. But then she smiled. And suddenly, she knew what she was going to do.\nFirst, she smacked the Acid Fly and ran around screaming until she washed the acid off. Then she ate breakfast, which were cold noodles mixed with sausage and onion. It was delicious. Then she walked down to the city.\nA thought struck Erin as she walked. She’d have to go back to the market. The market where she’d lost all of her money. Her footsteps slowed and then picked up. Suddenly, Erin had two things to do today. She was looking forward to both.",

    "text": "The second time the Human female entered the market, every head turned. This time, it wasn’t just because of her smell. The looks were amused and hostile, a mix of both. But this time, they faltered a bit because the first time she had been pierced by all the stares.\nThis time, she returned the gazes until people looked away, but they watched her out of the corners of their eyes.\nErin marched right up to the stall where she’d been ripped off. She glared at the Drake and then squinted. They had purple scales, but it was more of a lilac-purple. And they looked a bit—smoother-scaled? There was a different curve to their face. Erin hesitated.\n“Wait a second. Have we met?”\nThe Drake shook her head. A distinctly\nfemale\nvoice emerged from the toothy mouth.\n“Do you wish to buy a necklace, Human?”\nErin eyed the pendants and other jewelry on display.\n“Later, maybe. Right now, I want to talk to the Drake guy who ripped me off the other day. You know; the one that took all my money. The ugly one.”\nThe other customers and shopkeepers nearby who heard that laughed loudly. The female Drake grinned and covered her smile. She pointed, and Erin turned to see a scowling Drake four stalls down.\n“You.”\nErin marched over to the Drake. He glared at her, but now, Erin reflected the glower and added more to it. He shifted his gaze pointedly over Erin’s head. She cleared her throat. When he still ignored her, she kicked the bottom of his stall.\nThe Drake looked down and snapped at her.\n“What do you want?”\nErin gave him a polite smile without any of the sincerity.\n“Why, I’d like to do business. Jerk.”\nThe Drake hissed under his breath. He shook his head at her and flicked his tail in her direction.\n“My store’s closed to you, Human. I won’t sell to those without a hint of respect for others.”\n“Respect? I have tons of respect. Just for anyone who’s not you.”\nSeveral of the other shopkeepers laughed at that. Erin noticed she and the Drake were drawing a crowd. She didn’t particularly care.\nThe shopkeeper Drake glared harder at Erin.\n“You’re obstructing my business. Leave before I summon the Watch.”\nHe turned his back on Erin, but she rapped on his counter.\n“My business with\nyou\nisn’t done yet. I want my money back. You ripped me off the other day.”\nThe Drake looked over his shoulder.\n“So? I offered you my goods, and you paid my price. That is a basic rule of buying and selling. I have done nothing wrong.”\nThere was a general murmur of agreement from some of the shop owners and a discontented rumble among the shoppers. A Gnoll woman leaned over her stall, opening her mouth, but he shot her such a ferocious look she fell silent. She was watching Erin, anyway. There was an expression she liked on the Human’s face this time, and she stood closer to the shop counter, not huddling like she had on the first day.\nErin Solstice leaned over the counter and fixed the Drake with a glare.\n“Oh yeah? What if I’m not happy about what you sold me? I think for two and a half gold coins you should be selling me enough onions to fill the bottom floor of my inn. So how about I return to you what I’ve purchased and you give me a complete refund?”\nThe Drake sneered at her.\n“Do you take me for a slow-witted hatchling or a Human fool? I won’t accept food that’s days old! Besides, this store does not give out refunds!”\n“Really? Where does it say that?”\n“Right here.”\nThe Drake pointed to a sign. Erin stared at it and up at him with narrowed eyes amidst the laughter. She heard a low\ngrowl\nfrom the Gnoll woman and hesitated. Then she grinned mirthlessly.\n“Oh, right. It\ndoes\nsay that, doesn’t it? Too bad I can’t read. But I do remember you had your prices listed as well, didn’t you?”\nShe looked around at the other pieces of paper pinned to the wooden stall. The Drake shopkeeper lunged, but Erin was quicker. She pulled the familiar piece of paper away and waved it in front of his face.\n“Well. Why don’t we call the Watch after all? Buying and selling is all very well, but what about sticking to prices you write down?”\nThe Drake shopkeeper\nhissed\nagain, long and slow this time. His eyes flicked to the paper and back to Erin’s face. He wasn’t sweating, but Erin was pretty sure lizards didn’t sweat. Or maybe he just didn’t think he was in trouble yet.\n“Even—even if you have that bit of paper, what of it? I sell to many customers. And you—I barely remember what I sold to my last customer, let alone you.”\n“A bag of flour, one pot of oil, a small bag of salt, sugar, yeast, four sausages, and two onions.”\nErin said it instantly. She paused for a second.\n“And one crappy bag.”\nThe Drake stared at her with an open mouth. She smiled sweetly at him.\n“I’ve got a good memory. A really good one, actually. Perfect for numbers and lists.”\nHe didn’t have much to say to that. But the look on the shopkeeper’s face told Erin he wasn’t about to start tossing gold coins around. She leaned over the counter and stared at him. She wished she wasn’t so close. His breath smelled of rotten meat.\n“I want my money back. I’ll give you a few silver coins for what I paid, but I’m not leaving here until you give me my money. Now, we can do this the hard way and call a bunch of people over and you can lose all your business for the day,\nor\nyou can give my money back and I’ll—hey, is that a chess board?”\nErin pointed at one of the Drake shopkeeper’s displays. Everyone turned and looked. Amid the cluster of items he was selling, the Drake had a few chessboards complete with little pieces fashioned into Drakes and Gnolls!\nErin saw a\nknight\npiece in armor, a Drake with a sword and a shield, and her eyes locked on what was, instead of a bishop, someone with robes and a staff. A mage? But everything was the same; it was even set up, and he had a little sign attached to it that she couldn’t read. It had something like exclamation marks, though, so she guessed it was a hot product?\nSuddenly, Erin’s fury about being ripped off was replaced by pure fascination and excitement.\n“Oh hey, it is! It’s just like—I mean, the pieces are different, but it’s chess, it is!”\nThe Drake snarled and batted Erin’s hands away.\n“Get your hands off that! This is a valuable item! These are custom-carved and based on the Titan of Baleros’ standardized rules! The best [Tactician] in Liscor plays on these very boards I sell! I bet you don’t even know how the game is played!”\nErin glared back. Her hands were suddenly\nitching\nto hold a chess piece.\n“It’s a chess board made out of wood. Unless it’s made out of gold—which it’s not—it’s about as expensive as that food you sold me. So I guess you’re selling this for three gold coins, too?”\nThat got another laugh from the crowd who had gathered to watch Erin’s showdown with the shopkeeper. The Drake, on the other hand, just grabbed the chess board and pieces and went to shove them below his counter. Then he stopped and turned to her with a gleam in his eye.\n“Are you a player of chess, Human? If so, why don’t we bet on a game?”\nErin raised one eyebrow.\n“You mean, we play a game of chess for my money? Why should I do that?”\nThe Drake spread his arms innocently. Erin noticed his tail was wagging on the floor, but she pretended not to notice.\n“Human, you and I have a dispute. I refuse to pay for goods sold, and you refuse to leave. So long as you’re stinking up my storefront, I won’t have any business, so I offer a wager in good faith. Win against the player of my choice and I will pay you back the money you paid me, though it will cost me my goods that I have earned honestly. Lose and you agree in front of witnesses not to bother me again. That is my best offer.”\n“Lism…”\nOnce again, the Gnoll [Shopkeeper] growled warningly, and even the glare he shot her didn’t keep her from opening her mouth. Even one of the other Drakes looked concerned.\n“Lism, that’s a bit much…”\nErin narrowed her eyes at ‘Lism,’ and the [Shopkeeper] shot glares at the others to keep them silent while he gave her an innocent look. She knew something was up, but Erin just thought for a moment and then nodded. Her lips twitched once, but she managed to suppress them.\n“Fine. Let’s play.”\nThe shopkeeper smiled down at her. It was a smile full of teeth.\n“Give me ten minutes to call over my player. Then I will teach you why it is unwise to bet against your betters.”\nErin gave him a big, happy smile.\n“Fuck you.”",

    "text": "Twenty minutes later, Erin sat at a table in the middle of the street and played with a pawn. She set up the board and checked that it was right.\n“All the pieces are in the right spots? And these move like this?”\nShe turned to one of the onlookers, the super-tall Gnoll woman whom she’d met on the first day. The Gnoll squatted next to the board and frowned, conferring with a few others.\n“Hrr. Yes. That’s exactly how they move. You should call the Watch, Miss Human. You won’t win this game.”\nErin blinked at her. The woman sounded concerned and kindly. She nodded to the purple-scaled Drake, Lism, who was marching back with Erin’s opponent in tow.\n“Your opponent is very good, and Lism, that slimy bastard, will refuse to pay you if you lose.”\n“I know. How good is my opponent?”\n“The best in Liscor.”\nThe young woman’s fingers stopped moving as she picked up a little piece and admired it. Erin glanced into the Gnoll woman’s face and exhaled.\n“That good, huh? Got it.”\nShe didn’t get up or stop arranging the chess pieces. The Gnoll woman gave Erin an exasperated look and stood up, shaking her head. She joined the watchers as Erin got up to inspect whomever Lism had brought.\nThis Drake was interesting. He was shorter than Lism, clearly younger, and his scales were sky-blue, not a grungy purple. He had a light tunic on with the same insignia as Relc’s badge, and he had a few ink stains on his claws.\nHe also looked\nfascinated\nby Erin and actually held out a claw to shake before Lism brushed forwards.\n“Here he is, my nephew. Olesm, meet, er, this Human.”\n“What a delight. A Human? A [Trader]? What’s this about, Uncle? I’m supposed to be at work, you know—”\nThe Drake had a pleasant voice, and he looked around nervously, but Lism hushed him.\n“The Council will spare you a few moments, Olesm. Just sit down and win a game or two.”\nHe smiled innocuously at Erin, and the young woman saw the younger Drake try to hold out his clawed hand again and once more Lism stopped him.\nOlesm was his name?\nHe was thinner than the shopkeeper, but the Drake was still taller than she was. He sighed, glanced at his uncle, and finished setting up the pieces on his side with clear familiarity. Olesm seated himself and smiled at Erin across the table.\n“I apologize, Miss Human. I rarely get a chance to play any games within the city these days. May I know whom I am playing against?”\n“Of course. My name’s Erin. Erin Solstice.”\nHe nodded to her.\n“I am Olesm. I believe you know my uncle, who asked me to play in this match.”\nErin gave her opponent a friendly, genuine smile and then looked over his shoulder.\n“Is that your uncle? My, you two don’t look alike.”\nThe Drake hovering over his nephew’s shoulder hissed at her. Olesm raised what would have been his eyebrows if he had any.\n“I understand this is a game with a wager. I would urge you not to bet against me. I am quite a good player.”\nThe shopkeeper interjected quickly.\n“We have already agreed to the terms. The Human cannot back out now.”\nOlesm glanced at his uncle, irritated, and opened his mouth to reply, but Erin shook her head.\n“I’m not backing down. Let’s play. Besides, I wouldn’t want to disappoint the crowd.”\nShe gestured at the crowd of watching people. They were definitely people, but Erin wasn’t sure what else to call them. Drakes, Gnolls, and even one of Klbkch’s kind, the Antinium, were all gathered in a circle to watch the game. The Gnolls and Drakes stood close by, and Erin noted the Antinium was sweeping the street.\nBut every now and then, quite often, it would glance at the board, and it seemed\nreally\nkeen on getting the dust out from behind some stalls. None of the Gnolls or Drakes paid any attention to the Antinium save to keep their distance, and the crowd was quite distracted, anyways.\nSome of them seemed to be betting as well, and though Erin couldn’t hear what they were saying, they didn’t seem to be betting on her victory.\n“Are you sure, Miss? I really am quite good. I will be playing at my best.”\nThe blue-scaled Drake looked anxious, but Erin gave him a bland smile.\n“I don’t intend to lose either.”\nOlesm sighed, but made no further objection. Instead, he peered at the board and made sure his pieces were all aligned within the squares. He struck Erin as a very meticulous and careful type, which made him unique among the Drakes she’d met so far.\n“I’m surprised you know about this game. It was invented just a few years ago. By the Titan of Baleros himself. I’ve been playing it nearly since it came out, but it’s not caught hold yet in a lot of cities.”\n“You don’t say.”\nErin was busy examining the board, but she found that fascinating. She had already gone over the rules, but…she lifted one eye and then put a confused look on her face. Erin tapped one of the pieces, a Drake with a scepter and crown.\n“I’m not sure if the rules I know are the same in that case. This piece here. You can move a king together with a rook like this, right?”\nThe Drake blinked.\n“That’s right. I’m surprised you know that move.”\n“Oh, I’ve seen a few players use it. Knights move like this, right?”\n“Correct.”\n“And pawns can move two spaces on their first move, right? And if a piece is here, they can take it diagonally?”\nLism was trying to hide a gloating smile as the Gnoll woman groaned and the onlookers hastily tried to amend their bets one way. However, Olesm looked quite pleased by Erin’s questions.\n“You seem to know this game. Well, well. This might be a good challenge after all.”\nErin smiled blandly at the Drake.\n“I’m no expert. But there’s a wager on this one, so I’ll play my best. The white side moves first.”\n“Indeed it does.”\nThe shopkeeper smirked, and the other watchers crowded around closer as Olesm pushed a pawn forwards. Erin smiled at him.\n“Not many players lead with a pawn from the side. Most like going down the center.”\nShe pushed a pawn forward quickly. Olesm shrugged as he contemplated his next move.\n“I have found this strategy to work in some of my games. It is fascinating to play such a new game of strategy, and so I always test new theories out on the board.”\nA game that had only been out two years? So he probably didn’t even have a name for that opening move. The shopkeeper anxiously hovered over Olesm’s shoulder. He hissed in the younger Drake’s earhole.\n“So long as you win. You must win no matter what.”\nOlesm narrowed his eyes but didn’t take his eyes from the board. Eventually, he pushed forwards a pawn to counter Erin’s pawn. He was chatting conversationally as Erin moved a piece too-quickly. Olesm was clearly thinking over each move, but Erin seemed not to be thinking at all.\n“So you’re really good at chess in Liscor, huh? Have you played a lot of games?”\nErin pushed another piece forwards instantly and shrugged. Olesm blinked, and the onlookers muttered.\n“A few. But should you not spend more time thinking?”\nShe waved a hand at him.\n“Don’t worry, don’t worry. I’m having a blast. I just think fast about my next move, that’s all.”\nOlesm frowned at her, looking irritated by her attitude. He pushed forwards a rook in reply, a bit hastily, and retorted, though she doubted he was the snappish type. He was more…peeved.\n“You should think harder. I have played over a hundred games so far and won over two-thirds of them. If you truly are betting something important, it would not do to lose this game so easily.”\nErin smiled back at him.\n“A hundred? Wow. But like I said, don’t worry. I like to play chess too. And I’ve played a…few games too. I’m not worried.”\n“Why’s that?”\nErin smiled wider.\n“Because I’m going to win.”",

    "text": "By the time Relc got to the market street Erin was on, the game had gone on for twenty minutes. A few customers were at the stands haggling, but most were still watching the game. One smart Gnoll was selling them food as they watched, and the shopkeepers seemed content to put their business on hold to watch the fun.\nRelc was not having fun. He shoved his way to the front of the crowd and grabbed Erin. The crowd protested angrily. So did Erin.\n“Hey, what are you doing?”\n“What are\nyou\ndoing?”\nRelc snapped back at her. He pointed angrily to the game of chess where Olesm was taking his time considering his next move.\nErin shrugged.\n“This? I’m getting my money back. Let go of my shirt. You’ll poke holes in it.”\nShe tried to peel off Relc’s claws from her shirt. Relc let go, but pulled her away from the game. He leaned forwards and hissed at her.\n“Stop playing. This isn’t a fair game.”\n“What?”\nErin looked at the board and back at Relc.\n“You can’t cheat in chess. It’s fair.”\n“No, it’s not.”\nRelc raised his voice and pointed to the shopkeeper.\n“Hey, you! Yeah, you. I know you. Stop the game. This isn’t fair. The bet’s off.”\nThe crowd rumbled in discontent at Relc’s words. The Drake shopkeeper spread his claws out innocently.\n“It is a fair game. She let me name my player, and we agreed to the wager. There are many witnesses. It would be wrong to cancel the game now, Senior Guardsman.”\nRelc eyed the Drake shopkeeper balefully. Erin noticed the shopkeeper’s tail was wagging a bit. He also had a gleeful look if she was reading his face right.\n“I hate to agree with that jerk, but he’s right, Relc. I agreed to the wager, and I want to play. I’m going to win my money back and play some chess while I’m at it.”\n“Are you crazy? You’re going to\nlose\nthis game.”\nRelc hissed at Erin. She blinked up at him.\n“Am I? Why’s that?”\nRelc growled under his breath. He jerked a thumb over at the seated Drake who was studying the board with a frown.\n“That guy you’re playing? He’s a [Tactician]. The highest-leveled one in the city!”\nErin blinked again.\n“So? Does that mean he’s good at chess?”\n“Very!”\n“Well, so am I. It’s still a fair game, isn’t it?”\n“No! Are you stupid?”\nRelc seemed close to tearing out the spines on his head.\n“All [Tacticians] can tell when they’re being led into a trap! They’re good at playing these games—they have\nSkills!\nTactics are a [Tactician] thing—it’s in the name! How do you not know this? If you play one in a game, they’ll win almost every time! Plus, that idiot loves to play that stupid game!”\nThe Olesm looked up and glared at Relc.\n“I’m not using any Skills. I am simply matching Miss Solstice in a game of wits, Relc. Practice makes the player.”\nErin glared too, much to Relc’s chagrin. She jabbed him in the leg with a finger, looking more annoyed by his comments about chess than her odds.\n“It’s not a stupid game. And so what if he likes to play? Like I said, so do I. And I’m a good player.”\n“You still can’t win.”\n“I can.”\n“You\ncan’t.\n”\n“Oh, hi Klbkch.”\nErin turned away from Relc and waved at the silent ant man who had come up behind Relc. Klbkch nodded at her politely.\n“Miss Solstice. Please forgive my companion’s interruption. We are on duty, and it is improper of us to disturb a member of the public without cause. But Relc insisted we speak with you once we heard of the bet that had been made.”\n“Really? You heard about the bet?”\nKlbkch nodded.\n“Indeed. It is all over the city.”\n“Yeah, everyone was talking about the stupid Human who was dumb enough to wager on a game of chess against that idiot.”\nRelc jerked his thumb at Olesm. The other Drake continued pondering the board, but Erin could see him grinding his teeth in his seat.\nKlbkch nodded and leaned forwards to confer with Erin. Lism looked worried as two [Guards] glanced his way, but he clearly didn’t like Relc or Klbkch. Especially Klbkch from how he glowered.\n“I understand this is a bet made to recover your lost coin. However, I fear I must issue the same warning as Relc. The odds of you winning a game against Olesm are quite slim.”\nAt this point, Erin was getting exasperated by everyone telling her the same thing, but she glanced at her opponent, and a mischievous smile crossed her face.\n“Olesm. Oh yeah, that’s what his name is.”\nErin covered a smile as Olesm’s eye twitched. She turned to Klbkch and Relc.\n“Look, I’m glad you two care. But I’ve got this. It’s fine. You’ll see.”\nThe two guardsmen stared at her, unconvinced. Relc turned to Klbkch and whispered. Unfortunately, his voice was still quite loud, and Erin and those around them could hear him quite plainly.\n“I don’t think she gets it. Humans are kinda slow. You explain the [Tactician] bit to her.”\n“I believe you have given her adequate information. If she will not listen to you, she will not listen to me.”\n“Exactly. So stop calling me stupid or I’ll hit you.”\nErin glared at Relc, who shuffled his feet and looked away. She glared at Klbkch, who raised all four of his hands and bowed his head, and then shifted her glare back to Relc.\n“Let me play. You two can watch, but I’m going to play and win.”\n“But—”\nErin raised a finger.\n“No. Go away and let me play.”\nRelc opened his mouth, closed it, and then hissed long and loud. He threw up his hands and stomped back into the crowd.\n“\nHumans!\n”\nErin slid back into her seat and smiled at Olesm.\n“Sorry about that.”\nOlesm glanced over Erin’s shoulder and sniffed at Relc and Klbkch.\n“Think nothing of it. But if we’re done with the interruptions, it’s your move.”\n“So it is.”\nErin pondered the board. Then she slid another piece forwards.\n“Oi, Klbkch. What’s she doing? Was that a good move? It looked like a bad move.”\n“I am uncertain at this point. Allow me a few moments to assess the board before I give you my opinion. And please, lower your voice.”\nErin covered a smile as Olesm’s eye twitched. She waited for him to play another piece. As she did, she studied the board.\nChess. The pieces were different, and she was playing in a street in a city full of walking lizards and talking ants. But it was still chess.\nIt was\nwonderful\nto play again.",

    "text": "Olesm frowned as he toyed with a bishop Erin had cornered with one of her knights. He had no idea what a ‘bishop’ was; the [Carvers] had styled it after a [Mage] instead, but the Titan had referred to it thusly and that was how it was called in the game’s rules.\nNaturally, Olesm used the word because anything the Titan did, he did. The Drake moved the piece diagonally one way and then frowned. Then he moved it another way and frowned again. He glanced up at Erin.\nShe stared back at him innocently. The Human waited as the Drake moved his piece back and forth around a rook she’d used to attack his queen and then took one of her pawns with it. His frown didn’t go away, but he seemed content with the move. For about three seconds.\nErin moved another of her pieces forwards instantly. Her knight—a scaly Drake with a buckler in one hand and a scimitar in the other—took one of his pawns.\n“Check.”\nA susurration went through the audience around the two players. That was, except for Relc, who had gone to one of the stalls to buy something to eat. Olesm leaned back in his chair and gave Erin an admiring look.\n“Well done, I hadn’t anticipated that.”\n“It was just a lucky move. Well, not lucky, but it was quite nice, wasn’t it?”\n“Indeed.”\nOlesm moved his king sideways.\n“Your turn.”\nErin pointed at the board.\n“Oh, that’s check too. Sorry.”\nErin tapped her queen and pointed down the board. The Drake player grimaced and moved his king the other way.\n“That’s check as well. See the rook?”\nOlesm paused and blinked at the table. The crowd murmured more loudly, and Relc came back to look at the table.\nAfter a minute, Olesm made a move that wasn’t check, and the game went on. But now, he took longer and longer between each move, and his frown, which had started about five minutes ago, didn’t go away.\nMeanwhile, his uncle, the shopkeeper, watched the board with clear anxiety. He glared at Erin, who smiled serenely back at him. Whenever Olesm made a move, she would instantly move a piece and take one of his own or threaten his king. Eventually, she stopped staring at the board and stared at the shopkeeper with a smile on her face as Olesm frantically searched the board for a comeback.\nSomething was wrong. At first, he’d thought she was careless. But as the game had progressed, Olesm had noticed he was losing more pieces. Yet he didn’t process his vague sense of unease until this moment. He began moving his pieces, taking few of hers, and watched as his began to fly off the board.\nLike someone creeping up on him.\nLike a Rock Crab, the young woman closed her trap. And the ‘even game’ he’d thought he’d been playing began turning into—the young woman smiled at Olesm and Lism.\nHer voice was quite even, but she kept speaking each time she moved a piece. Not every turn, but she said it to the crowd’s growing amazement. It was just part of the game. Although, the way she said it might be a bit rude.\nNevertheless, Erin calmly looked Olesm in the eyes as she placed a piece near his king.\n“Check.”\n“Check.”\n“Ooh, no check this turn. But watch out for your rook. It’s that or your queen.”\n“Check.”\n“Check. And it’s check if you do that too. And that…”\n“Check.”\n“Check.”\n“Check.”\nErin Solstice\nby\nArtsyNada\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "“Checkmate.”\nAt last, Erin slid her last rook into position. Olesm stared at the board and then tipped over his king with a trembling claw.\nA sigh ran through the audience surrounding the chessboard. It sounded like disbelief. The choking noise coming from Lism’s mouth was like a lawnmower engine failing to rev up. But the rest of the crowd exhaled in pure amazement.\nThe tall Gnoll woman’s arms were slightly uncrossed, and she was eying Erin with a look of amazement. Relc—pure incredulity as he peered at the board. Klbkch was counting how many pieces Erin had left. Then, his head rose, and he looked at Erin, surprised. Nodding to himself, as if he’d suddenly seen something obvious that had been hidden by the clouds.\nErin cracked her fingers and grinned. It wasn’t her best game, but she’d gone for drama over efficiency. Her opponent had a single king left in the middle of her pieces, and she had a small army surrounding him. She smiled up at Olesm, who’d turned pale. Her audience was gaping at her and the chess board.\nTwo rooks, one knight, a bishop, her queen, and a few pawns. Olesm had one king. Technically, he’d been in check for a long time, but Erin had hunted down the last pawns before putting him into a final checkmate.\nShe would have been ashamed of herself, doing this to any other rookie player. It was rude, bullying, and any chess tourney in the world would have probably had some things to say to her in private or called her out on the spot.\nBut she wasn’t home, on Earth, and she had never taken a game as personally as this one. Erin stared up at unfamiliar skies and the open ramps and sprawling architecture of a city unknown to her. Drakes and Gnolls, gazing at her with faces full of scales and fur.\nShe couldn’t even read the signs. But the game? Erin Solstice’s eyes tingled slightly. The game had never left her. Chess.\nHer game.\nThe pieces looked different, but it played the exact same way, and she knew that board more than she knew the back of her hand or her own room. She had sat on both ends of the board ever since she was five years old.\nThe blue Drake, Olesm, was still in a state of shock. He was staring at his lone king, tipped over, like he didn’t know what had hit him. And to be fair—Erin had to admit she didn’t look like a chess expert. Who did, though?\nShe was no grandmaster, anyways. She’d quit, come back—it was a long story. But it was enough to say that if chess was a few years old in this world, Olesm, who might have…four years? She had forgotten how long the game was out.\nCall it a four-year-old chess player going up against someone with at least four times his career. She’d played grandmasters—and sometimes won. And that had been when she was a girl.\n“Good game. Let’s play again sometime, okay?”\nErin reached over and patted Olesm on the shoulder. The Drake looked slightly shell-shocked and made no reply. Erin waited, then shrugged and stood.\nKlbkch and Relc made their way through the crowd to her. Relc was still pointing at the board and gobbling.\n“You won. But how did—but he’s—you won!”\n“Congratulations on your victory, Miss Solstice.”\n“Why thank you, Klbkch.”\nErin grinned at Klbkch. The ant man nodded back.\n“May I ask how you managed such an incredible display? I would not have thought it possible, nor deemed it prudent to bet against Olesm in a game of chess until this moment.”\nErin shrugged. There was no harm in telling. Besides, both the shopkeeper and his nephew were still staring at the board.\n“You said he’s played for a few years, right?”\nKlbkch nodded.\n“And he is a Level 22 [Tactician]. There are few higher-level [Tacticians] even within the Liscorian army. Although that is largely because most consolidate to [Strategist].”\nErin had no idea what that meant, but she nodded as if she understood.\n“Good for him. But I’ve been playing chess for…at least fifteen years, now. I stopped playing for a while until recently, but I used to play at least three games before I went to sleep each night. He might have a fancy Skill, but a rookie’s still a rookie.”\nThis time, it was Klbkch’s turn to do the staring with Relc. Erin smiled at both of them and then tapped the shopkeeper on the shoulder.\n“I want my money back. All of it, thank you. And while you’re at it, I’ll buy the chess board and pieces too.”\nThe Drake gaped at her. Then the color returned to the scales in his face, and he backed away.\n“I—that game was—”\nErin interrupted him.\n“If you’re about to say it was rigged, don’t bother. And if you want a rematch, I’ll gladly play again if you double how much you owe me. Which is a bad idea because I’ll win. I want my money.”\nThe Drake blanched, and his scales turned pale. Erin smiled at him. His tail was twitching hard in agitation.\n“My mind is…slightly hazy. I’m afraid I have no recollection of how much you spent. Unless of course you could tell me?”\nErin gave him a winning smile.\n“Two gold pieces, seven silver, and four copper exactly. I don’t have a receipt, but I’m sure Klbkch and Relc could help you find out.”\nLism stared at Erin as if doubting her memory, but it was just numbers. Like chess moves—Erin couldn’t remember the Pythagorean Theorem to save her life, but she could remember entire chess games. At her words, Klbkch nodded seriously and bowed in his direction.\n“As Senior Guardsmen, we would be happy to provide assistance in assessing all financial income for your business, as well as any unpaid taxes that may be extant. For now, we will have to order your shop closed while we begin a thorough investigation of your wares and inventory.”\nRelc grinned evilly.\n“Right. Let’s start flipping over tables until we find a receipt.”\nThe Drake shopkeeper made a strangled shrieking sound. He tried to block Relc, but the Drake [Guardsman] was already happily trashing his store. Erin hid a grin.\nOnly now did Lism’s nephew seem to come out of his stupor. He jerked, looked at the chess board, then stood slowly. Olesm walked up to her, his tail dragging low on the ground. But he did hold out a clawed hand to shake.\n“I must congratulate you, Miss Solstice. I have been truly humbled by your skill. Please, accept my sincerest apologies for questioning your ability.”\nErin fidgeted awkwardly. She hated this bit. At least he was taking it better than some. There was no shame in losing. Sometimes you got frustrated, but when pride was on the line or you refused to admit you’d lost to a\ngirl—\nshe took his hand and shook it gently, looking into his eyes.\n“Oh no, you were a good player too. I really shouldn’t have played like that as well against a rooki—another player.”\n“You are too kind. But I know when I’m outclassed. I have to ask—are you a [Tactician] by any chance?”\n“Me? No. I’m not. Sorry?”\nOlesm drooped further. Erin could practically feel him kicking himself. She tried to cheer him up.\n“Don’t feel bad. I’m not a professional player, but I’ve won a chess tournament or two in my time. I’ve even played a grandmaster and won. One of the few female ones, which was really cool. But I was so nervous at the time I totally forgot to castle, and I lost my rook to—”\nErin broke off and cleared her throat, blushing. It was a bad memory, but at least Olesm stopped looking like a kicked puppy-lizard. Indeed, he was staring at her with vivid interest.\n“Is this ‘grandmaster’ you speak of a class? Is it possible—could I take such a class myself?”\nAn alarm bell went off in Erin’s head. She tried to think fast and failed.\n“Um. Maybe? It’s more like a title where I come from. Besides, grandmasters only play chess. I’m not sure if that’s a class.”\nOlesm nodded. Erin could practically see him taking notes in his head.\n“Perhaps it’s a class only obtainable at high levels in the [Strategist] class line. If ever I have the opportunity, I shall take that class at once.”\n“You can do that?”\nErin blurted it out. Olesm nodded again.\n“Of course. I am merely a lowly [Tactician], the first of the [Strategist] class line. But should I advance in level and learn more skills, I might qualify for the [Strategist] class. And perhaps after that I might one day become a [Grandmaster]…? It makes my scales shiver to imagine such a class.”\nOlesm stared dreamily off into the air. Erin edged away from him a bit.\n“Right, well good luck with that.”\nShe wanted to go back and get her money, which the Drake shopkeeper was practically begging Relc to take as the other Drake frolicked in the destruction of his shop. But Olesm had her cornered, and now Klbkch was on her tail.\n“Miss Solstice. I believe this is your wager.”\nHe offered her the exact lost sum she’d quoted. Erin took the coins gratefully.\n“Thank you, Klbkch.”\nHe raised his mandibles and opened them in a…smile? Olesm edged back from Klbkch at once, but not far. The Antinium nodded politely.\n“I am merely fulfilling my duty as a member of the Watch. And once again, may I congratulate you on your victory? I would greatly enjoy playing a game against you once I am off-duty.”\nOlesm nodded in fervent agreement. Erin smiled and wondered whether they’d follow her back to the inn.\n“Another game? Sure, sure. After I finish my shopping—well, one or two more games won’t hurt, but I don’t have time today.”\nKlbkch nodded while Olesm visibly drooped. Erin felt bad, but she also knew his type. As in the type of player who would challenge her to another game day and night unless she said no.\n“Tell you what, next time, we can play a bunch of games. Not just chess—if you guys have got other strategy games, I’d love to play them too.”\nOlesm’s face lit up.\n“Do you like these kinds of games, Miss Solstice? Gnollstones? Magical cards? I’m sure you must be quite good at any game you play.”\nErin grinned and waved a hand self-deprecatingly, but her ears perked up at the fascinating names. She noticed Klbkch glancing at Olesm silently, but then the ant man returned his attention to her.\n“Oh, I love all kinds of strategy games. I always surfed YouTube for—uh, what I mean is, I used to watch and play tons of chess games. And not just chess; I learned how to play Shogi, Go, and even a few card games. But I couldn’t gamble, so there was that.”\nErin shrugged. Olesm stared at her blankly.\n“Excuse me, but I am unfamiliar with these games. Is ‘shogi’ another game of strategy as chess is?”\n“No, no. Shogi is a game that originated in Japan. And, uh, Japan is…and…um…”\nErin trailed off. Klbkch and Olesm stared at her intently. She could practically see the Drake’s eyes lighting up in eager interest.\nIt occurred to Erin that trying to explain a game that originated in a country in a world that no one had heard of that used a language based off of a culture which also didn’t exist would probably be a bad idea. But they were both staring at her. It was Klbkch who saved her.\n“—Of course, these games are quite rare outside of your home nation, Miss Solstice. I doubt they would have permeated to Izril yet. I have heard of and observed Shogi before.”\nOlesm glanced at him and hurriedly nodded before shaking his head.\n“Oh! Yes! Sorry, it’s my mistake for not recognizing—hah, I suppose there are a lot of games I should look into. Forgive me.”\n“Not at all. Um—maybe we should save that guy’s shop?”\nErin relaxed and pointed at Relc. Olesm turned, distracted, and Erin mouthed a silent ‘thank you’ at Klbkch. She could have sworn he twitched one antenna at her, like a wink.",

    "text": "Liscor had several markets that were open at any given time during the day. It also had many streets. So it had more than one Market Street too. But only one had a Human walking down the street and admiring the displays.\nErin’s feet hurt. She felt that was ridiculous. After all, she’d been playing chess while sitting down for nearly an hour. Yet, she hadn’t stopped smiling as she played first Olesm, then Klbkch in a series of quick games.\nWhich she’d won. All of them. A rare thing among chess players, but while they were good…Erin had enjoyed herself so much she’d been on fire, metaphorically speaking, and played her best.\nNot only that, she had her money back!\nErin jingled the money pouch at her belt. Klbkch had helped her buy one to carry all the money she now had. It was wonderfully heavy and made lovely\nchinking\nsounds as Erin walked, but she was also worried someone would steal it.\nThat was why she had to spend all of it fast. Erin hesitated and then walked a few stores down from where the Drake shopkeeper was screaming over his destroyed shop and cursing Relc and Humans in general. She approached another stall, filled to bursting with all kinds of goods. It looked nice.\nEach wooden stall was, simultaneously, identical and unique if that made sense. Identical because they were carbon-copy frames of wood, a counter and semi-enclosed space that each [Shopkeeper] could place their goods in and sell from. Erin had seen similar things at farmers’ markets back home.\nWhat made them unique was that the canvas roofs were all hand-stitched and of different colors. So a blue tarpaulin covering might have tiny little golden Dragons on the edges, or another stall would just have a plain white cloth covering. And the goods were obviously different for each.\nA Drake was selling what looked like…\narmor?\nMade out of eerily black chitin. In fact, he even had a sword sheath shaped like a giant…leg. An insect’s leg. Erin wondered if Klbkch found it offensive, but she was reminded less of the Antinium’s beetle-ish forms and more of a spider.\nA\nbig\nspider if that was the leg. She shuddered and hurried on, but the Drake was still calling out.\n“Shield Spider gear! Cheaper than Pallassian steel and almost as good! Anyone fancy some adventurer’s equipment? No? Please?”\nNot many people wanted to wear spider-based armor, it seemed. Another Gnoll was just selling pots and making a killing, from the looks of it. He had cheap cooking pots, cups, storage vessels—anything you could want. Erin was curious, but what she needed was\nfood.\nWhile there were a number of produce-selling shops, only a few had a myriad of goods, which Erin guessed were [Shopkeepers] like the terrible Lism, who had a bunch of items on display. One caught her eye, and it was a stall with a rich violet covering. Violet—with a silver-threaded fang in the center. Striking, attractive, and simple.\nErin had been too harried the other day to appreciate the shop, but she recognized the owner. And this time, she slowed down and really looked at the owner.\nIt was that tall Gnoll woman who’d warned her about Olesm! She, like many of her people, wasn’t wearing a full-body dress, but a kind of decorated breastband and waistcloth. It worked because, well, she was covered in fur.\nA light mahogany color. Or…walnut? Erin wasn’t sure how many colors of brown she actually knew, but the fur covered the Gnoll from head-to-toe. Like the other Gnolls, she had a vaguely…hyena-shaped head? A mane of darker hair running down her neck, like Drakes had neck-spines, and her ‘fingers’ and ‘toes’ that Erin could see in her sandals were furry paws, although fully flexible.\nShe seemed well-known by a lot of the shoppers here and called out greetings to a few who passed. When she caught sight of Erin, the Gnoll woman sniffed.\nUnlike the first time they’d met, the Gnoll [Shopkeeper] did not greet Erin or wave her over. She folded her arms and waited.\nErin winced inside, but there was nothing for it. She stepped closer and waved at the tall Gnoll.\n“Um. Hi. Are you open for business?”\nThe Gnoll looked down at Erin. She wasn’t smiling.\n“I am, and I see you’ve wrestled some coin out of Lism’s claws, that greedy hoarder. Good for you, Human. But if you are here to look down your nose again at my goods, I would prefer not to waste my time, no?”\nShe seemed offended, and Erin recalled that she’d run off straight to Lism and snubbed the Gnoll’s friendly greetings. Erin blushed and ducked her head.\n“What? No, no. I’m actually here to, uh, apologize.”\nErin tried to gauge the Gnoll shopkeeper’s reaction. It was hard to read her face. Like Relc and Klbkch, a Gnoll’s face didn’t display the same expressions as a Human one. But Erin didn’t detect the same amount of hostility in her features.\n“Oh? What do you have to say then?”\n“Um. Sorry?”\nThe Gnoll raised one eyebrow, and her ears twitched back.\nThat\nwas a Human reaction, so Erin went on quickly.\n“It’s just that I was having a bad day, and I met this other Gnoll who\nreally\ndidn’t like me. So, uh, I was kinda afraid you would get growly at me too. But I’m sorry about that. I shouldn’t judge by, uh, species.”\nThe Gnoll looked at her. Erin still couldn’t read her face. But—weren’t Gnolls kind of like hyenas? They looked like them. And hyenas were cats. Or maybe they were dogs. Either way, Erin peeked at the Gnoll’s ears.\nThey were twitching. And once Erin saw that, she saw the Gnoll’s lips were twitching the merest fraction. Erin tried out a smile. To her surprise, the Gnoll smiled back. And laughed. She had a\nlot\nof sharp teeth, but the laugh was so boisterous Erin wasn’t as afraid.\n“Hah! This is the first time I have heard a Human apologize in…months? A good day, yes? It is good you come to make amends. I will forgive you and forgive the smell you stink of as well.”\nErin frowned. Was this good or bad?\n“Sorry, I don’t want to make you mad again. But—do I really smell that bad? I just had a bath.”\nThe Gnoll shopkeeper laughed again. She—and now that Erin looked, she was\ndefinitely\na she— clapped one hand on Erin’s shoulder. Erin’s knees buckled.\n“I do not mock you, Human. But I laugh because I forget others do not have our nose. Forgive, please. You stepped in something on your way to the city.”\nErin rubbed at her shoulder surreptitiously. Then she looked down at her feet, made a face, and began dragging her foot around on the street.\n“\nEugh!\nWhat was—that’s so gross! I’m so sorry! I had that on my foot the entire time? You’re totally forgiven. Your nose is amazing! Do I, uh, smell at all beyond that?”\nThe Gnoll shopkeeper nodded, turning serious.\n“You smell of burned ash and trash. No; not just that foul smell. Even burning trash smells better. I know not what it was, but I can still smell it on you. You could also use some soap, a shampoo for your hair.”\n“Really? You can smell all that?”\nErin sniffed at her arm experimentally, but she smelled like she always did. Better, actually, since she had found the stream to wash up in.\nThe Gnoll wrinkled her nose.\n“Oh yes. It’s not too bad now though. All that blood and oil covers it up.”\nErin froze. The Gnoll laughed at her expression. Then she sombered and gave Erin a long, appraising look.\n“I smell that too. Blood and death. Yet you don’t stink of fear anymore. You smell like a [Warrior] from my tribe after their first battle or hunt. I am relieved for that, yes? You have a bravery in you, to win a fight to the death alone.”\n“It’s nothing to be proud of.”\nErin replied automatically. Her stomach was dropping out of her legs, but the Gnoll shopkeeper didn’t seem to notice.\n“Isn’t it? You stormed back here, trounced both Lism in words and his nephew in chess—although Olesm is the better of the two by far—and in front of all to see! Warrior and tactician, both! A fine day for a young woman to have—”\n“No.”\nErin cut the shopkeeper off flatly.\n“It’s not anything to be proud of. At all.”\nThe Gnoll stared down at her. Erin met her gaze. At last, the Gnoll shrugged.\n“Hrm. If you insist. I apologize if I’ve erred. Humans can be difficult to understand.”\nThat last remark stung. Erin gritted her teeth.\n“Why do all of you say that? I’m Human. So what?”\nThe Gnoll grinned at her with all her teeth.\n“Because you\nare\nHuman. Few of us have ever seen your kind here, let alone talked to one.”\nErin smiled sourly.\n“Well, you’re the first Gnoll I’ve talked to. The first one that wasn’t angry at me, at least.”\nThe Gnoll [Shopkeeper] laughed and slapped Erin on the shoulder again, but gently. Two huge brown eyes met Erin’s, and she growled in approval.\n“Hah! You are a spirited one! I like you. So I will introduce myself. I am Krshia, [Shopkeeper] and seller of goods. And you are the Human who slew the Goblin Chieftain! What is your name, brave little one?”\nSo she knew, already, who Erin had killed. The young woman bit her tongue.\n“I’m Erin. Erin Solstice.”\nErin stuck out her hand but found herself grabbed and squeezed tightly by the Gnoll shopkeeper. It was a bear hug by a creature that looked sort of like a bear. She was strong enough for a bear too, and Erin felt oxygen quickly leaving her body.\nThe Gnoll must have heard Erin squeak or felt her dying because she eased up on the pressure. She sniffed at Erin, only wrinkling her nose slightly. For Erin’s part, she smelled spices, sweat, a strong doggish smell, and that earthy smell that came from a day or two of not bathing. Then she was on the ground blinking up at the Gnoll.\n“There. We have met, and we are now friends. Come into my shop, Erin Solstice, and tell me what you need. For the pleasure of seeing Lism humiliated, I will give you a discount. And I will not steal your coins. That is a promise from a Gnoll of the Silverfang tribe.”\n“Silverfang?”\nErin blinked at her, but stepped inside the stall and looked around. Her first impression of Krshia’s full stall was of a dazzling panorama of goods. Sacks of food, neatly labelled as ‘wheat’, ‘rye’, ‘ashwheat’, and so on, occupied the lower part of the stall. In English, along with labels in that foreign script! Higher up were some books with interesting labels. Erin saw only a few on display, and they were pricey—gold instead of silver! But Krshia had a bunch of knives sharing space with some earrings made out of what might have been pure silver and bits of gemstone.\nAt first, it looked like everything, but Erin noted gaps in the stock. It appeared everything Krshia sold was in popular demand. She blinked as she took in the huge supply.\n“Wow. Okay. That’s a lot of stuff. But that’s good, because I need a lot of stuff. Like food, clothing, um, soap. Toothpaste—do you have—?”\n“Aha. I see why Lism got exasperated. Let us take a moment to breathe, Miss Erin.”\nKrshia cut Erin off with a friendly smile and a raised finger. She gestured Erin onto a stool.\n“I am not gifted with perfect memory via Skill or otherwise. Let us make a proper list, and I will be able to see what you want, yes? It will take time, but we shall be more organized than me fetching this or that.”\nErin nodded, impressed by the decision-making. It made her feel a bit silly for not having a list herself, not that she had any paper. But her mom would have had a grocery list.\nHer mom. Erin’s mind caught at the idea, but she pushed it down and focused on the Gnoll. Krshia bared her teeth at her again, but Erin was pretty sure it was a smile. A toothy smile, but the Gnoll was inviting.\n“I will give you a fair price. Just as I said. I hail from the Silverfang Tribe, far to the south. The Great Plains of Izril. Have you heard of us?”\n“Um. No. A tribe, huh? What does Silverfang do?”\n“Oh, we are fine [Traders], but we also mine silver and do much with it. I have not been home in nearly a decade, but you may find many Gnolls in Liscor are Silverfangs. Sit, sit! Ah, here is some parchment. Now, tell me what you need. And then I will have your goods delivered rather than make you pay for a\nbag.\n”\nShe growled derisively, and Erin realized this was another way she might have been ripped off by Lism. The young woman blinked.\n“Delivered? You do deliveries?”\nKrshia laughed.\n“Of course. Did you think many would carry off bags of flour as you did? It is too hard. No; the stupid shopkeeper Lism, fur sheddings that he is, didn’t tell you and gave you the bag on purpose. But then again—have you never had a Street Runner deliver anything? It may be a bit more for somewhere outside Liscor, but I know a few Street Runners who will do it.”\nErin glanced over at Lism’s distant shop. He was still screaming at his store and his nephew. It looked like Olesm was recreating the game they’d played on another chess board. Erin had already bought the board she’d won on.\n“I feel bad about that, actually.”\n“Bad?”\nKrshia stared at Erin in surprise and then laughed again.\n“Humans are strange. He would not give you the same if he were in your place; he surely would not.”\nErin shrugged.\n“Still, it’s not nice. And the law should be equal for everyone.”\nAgain, Krshia stared at Erin. Erin shifted uncomfortably.\n“Well, that’s what I was always taught. Plus, I bullied Olesm a bit.”\nThe Gnoll shook her head, but not in confusion so much as…a kind of amused gratification.\n“That is a viewpoint I have not often heard since coming to Liscor. So, you truly knew what you were doing, but you pretended to be humble and baited him into that game. Cleverer still!”\nErin ducked her head.\n“I didn’t know he was going to challenge me to chess! That was a lucky coincidence. I just—happen to be really good at it.”\n“Hm. How good is ‘really good?’ Olesm may be young, but he is considered the best player in Liscor sheerly by how much he plays. From how you speak—it sounds like you made a choice to ‘bully’ him. If he were a Level 20 [Warrior], say, what would you be?”\nThe question caught Erin off-guard as Krshia produced a tub of what might have been toothpaste—and a brush. She offered Erin a choice between mint and lemon, and Erin pointed at the lemon.\n“I, uh—well, I dunno. If he’s Level 20…I’d be Level 60?”\nKrshia nearly tripped and caught herself and turned to stare at Erin. Instantly, Erin felt like she’d made a mistake.\n“Is that off?”\n“If you say it’s so—so you could beat him one-handed, eh? Blindfolded, even? What did you want? Soap? I have a few from the [Alchemist]. But to wash the body…no, this is hair conditioner for Gnolls. I don’t think you need quite this much. Scale cream…I will have someone find it.”\nErin saw Krshia glancing her way as she produced a bar of soap. The [Innkeeper] fidgeted. She knew it sounded like bragging, but—she coughed into her hand.\n“Er…I might be able to beat him blindfolded.”\nAt this, Krshia actually stopped and gave Erin a look that said she didn’t believe her. Erin raised her hands.\n“Sorry! I know it sounds like I’m blowing smoke, but you can play chess blindfolded if you know the pieces. He’s a talented…rookie. But he doesn’t know any chess openings, and I’ve played since I was a kid.”\n“Since you were a child. Hrr. Now that’s…”\nKrshia’s eyes sharpened, and Erin fidgeted, but the Gnoll smiled in an incomprehensible way. She walked over and tapped one of the earrings she had. Erin noticed it was set with a beautiful bit of quartz which was glowing a bright blue. Wait…hadn’t it been clear just now?\n“Fascinating. This truth-stone earring says you are telling the truth. So I believe you.”\n“Wh—\ntruth stones?\nThat’s what that thing is? I’ve never seen something like that! Is it magic?”\nKrshia looked amused. Then she frowned as the blue glow grew brighter.\n“Really? Not once? I…have never seen a truth stone before either.”\nAt that, the stone turned a murky red color, and the Gnoll poked it a few times, looking mystified.\n“So it\nis\nworking. Tribes! Well, I suppose…they’re not the most common, and it is an expensive item. More gold than you have, Miss Erin. Not that I won’t sell it to you if you have, er, forty-eight more pieces.”",

    "text": "As she did not, Erin changed the subject, but she noticed Krshia glancing at the earring in confusion more than once.\n“So. These deliveries…how do they work?”\nKrshia smiled. She pointed to a small wooden bowl filled with brightly painted wooden tokens. Circular, with little markings on them in the unknown script. Erin looked at them and saw each had an intricate little design of red and gold that made up a pattern around the edge. The center was filled with some words and a symbol. It looked a bit like…a foot? A stylized, clawed foot like Relc’s.\n“Don’t tell me you’ve never seen a Runner’s Guild Seal before? Hah—maybe not Drake ones? You\nhaven’t?\nWell then…they are for Runners. When I give you one, I will keep its twin, yes? Then, when a Runner delivers your goods, you will give him the Seal you have, and then I will know my goods have been delivered. It is simple.”\nErin picked up one of the pieces of wood.\n“Runner’s Guild? So you’re saying it’s like a postal service?”\n“A what?”\n“Um. A delivery service?”\n“That is what I have said, Erin Solstice.”\nErin blushed while Krshia grinned toothily at her and laughed.\n“Right, sorry. I just haven’t ever heard of these Runners before. What do they do, besides make deliveries?”\nKrshia gave her a long look and snuck another quick look at the blue earring. She seemed to be checking whether Erin was making fun of her.\n“Runners run. They are quick ones, those who can run long distances to earn money. Sometimes they deliver letters, other times valuable things. Goods, yes? Magical items, messages that must only be spoken to one person. Such are expensive requests though. Only the best carry such things. Most just deliver goods very cheaply. I can call one and have all that you buy delivered to your inn for a good price.”\nErin thought she knew what Krshia was talking about. In the bustling city, hadn’t she seen a few Gnolls and Drakes racing about faster than everyone else? Krshia nodded when she mentioned seeing them.\n“That would be a Street Runner. If you were living far away, I would call for a City Runner. For a long journey, perhaps to another continent, or in a dangerous spot, or if I needed the fastest in the world, I would pay for a Courier—and spend a fortune on the delivery!”\nThat sounded good, but Erin had learned skepticism here.\n“What’s a good price?”\n“It is the broken inn a few miles east of here, yes?”\nErin nodded. Krshia scratched her chin.\n“…Four silver coins. Not a small price. If it were the city, it would be one, or maybe coppers for a small delivery. But it is far, yes? And if it is heavy and monsters lurk about, the price goes up. You are lucky the Goblins are scarce and the Hollowstone Deceivers do not travel this late in the season. So I advise you to buy a\nlot\nand have the delivery done once, yes?”\nErin thought about that. It sounded really good. Better than carrying anything herself.\n“I like it.”\nKrshia grinned at her again. This time, Erin grinned back using all of her teeth.\n“I knew I liked you for a reason. Then tell me what you want, and let us not waste the light, eh?”\n“Sounds good to me.”",

    "text": "Later that evening, Erin sat in her inn and felt at her money pouch. It was much lighter now, but she felt a lot better about it. She felt a lot better about life, actually.\nShe had fresh clothes on, and she no longer smelled of…well, she no longer smelled. Instead, her skin had been bathed in an orange-y scent from the soap she’d used. And lemon toothpaste made her mouth feel fresh.\nAnd\nshe hadn’t had to dodge fish in the stream while bathing either.\nThe day had been full of busy things, and none of them had been entirely bad. After she’d bought all of the goods she needed from Krshia, and even haggled a bit over the price, the Gnoll had shown her to the bath house to have a proper wash. Then Erin had gone back to her inn, eaten the rest of the pasta, and she was now enjoying a minor food coma as she sat in a chair in her inn.\nErin played with one of the chess pieces on the table. She’d carried the chess board and a few essential items like soap with her back to the inn. She hadn’t wanted to let the chess board go. It was incredible, really. Chess? In a world like this? Actually, it made sense, but Erin was still amazed. She had to keep touching the pieces to make sure they were real.\nBut she had to focus. Erin dragged her mind back on track. Krshia told her the Runner would deliver her stuff tomorrow at some point. Until then, she could clean up the inn a bit. Or maybe play a game against herself. That was fun too. It was just—\nErin stared down at the chess board. She murmured to herself.\n“Knight to D4. Pawn to E3.”\nSuddenly, her good feeling vanished. Erin felt cold. The food in her stomach was dead weight instead of comfort, and she felt sick. Her hands shook as she put the pieces back on the table. Everything was better. It really was. But…\n—If she closed her eyes, Erin could still see a Goblin lying on the ground next to her. If she opened her hands, she could still feel the dead weight between her palms.\nErin moved a pawn up and took the knight. She stared at the pieces on the board.\n“It’s kill or be killed in this world, after all.”\nShe put her head in her hands and rubbed at her eyes. Yes. That was what she’d learned. And she hated it. All of the good that had come to her seemed like it had been built on the bad.\nThe bad. The dead. A game of chess on a pile of corpses. Erin stared at the chess board.\nShe was good at chess. She liked chess. She’d grown up playing chess and other games like that, despite the fact that girls weren’t common in chess tournaments. Chess had been fun to her until she’d grown up and realized she’d never become a Grandmaster herself. She was good, but not great. But chess had still been her hobby. Chess was fun. It was about outwitting the opponent, about using strategy—\nIt wasn’t at all like killing someone.\nErin stared at her hands. They were quivering. She could still feel them burning. It was all a game, though, wasn’t it? A game with levels and classes. A game like chess.\n“It’s just a game. Just a game?”\nErin stared at the board. Pieces. If she thought about it like that, then death seemed to matter less. She’d done the right thing. She’d defended herself, killed the monster.\nKilled the monster.\nShe stared down at the two dead Goblins. They were so small. Like children. And they had family. Friends. Those who loved them.\nThe ragged Goblin. The ones hiding outside her inn, scrawny and afraid. They were the enemy too, if she played the game like chess. The right thing to do would be to hunt them down and kill them. That was how all games worked.\nThat was how you played chess.\nErin sat up. She remembered the Goblin’s hand in hers, the feeling of his skin. She remembered his smile. She remembered laughing.\nAnd then she understood. Erin put her hand underneath the chess board and flipped it off the table. Both white and black pieces soared into the air and clattered against the floor.\nErin stood up.\n“I remember why I got bored of chess. There’s only one winner and one loser. The best game for both players is a draw.”\nShe walked over to the door and yanked it open. Then she stopped and turned. She raised her middle finger and flipped off the chess board a second time.\n“I’ll make my own rules. And anyone that doesn’t like it can go to hell.”\nThe door slammed shut as Erin walked out. A few minutes later, she rushed back into the inn and carefully put all the pieces back onto the chess board.\n“Still a great game, though. Don’t take it personally. Let me just get a quick snack for the road. And I need some soap. Proper hygiene and all that. Where did I put the soap? Soap, soap, soap…I should really organize all this stuff. Maybe tomorrow.”\nThen she was gone, running down to the city. There was still plenty of daylight left in the sky. And she had one more thing left to do. The most important thing of all.",

    "text": "The sun was setting over the grassland when the young woman returned to the inn. She stopped, again, and saw a streak of purple grass blowing as the cool winds came down across the rolling hills and valleys. Shadows crept and lengthened across the old inn. They should have exposed cracks, but as she looked up, the darkness seemed to hide the age of the building, all the little imperfections and signs of age.\nLike this—it looked like what it had been in its heyday, a lone building set against the fading crimson sky, visible for miles away if it were lit up from the inside.\nErin Solstice slowly put down her burden. Her arms hurt, and she regretted not adding this to the delivery, but she had been too excited to wait. Krshia had humored her and even helped Erin buy what she wanted.\nShe was carrying a bucket filled with nails, a brush, and even a few slats of straight wood planks. And a hammer. It was quite heavy, and the young woman muttered and rubbed at her aching shoulders.\nHowever, she eventually reached the inn’s door and set down her burden. Then she gazed up.\nThe shadowy sign was long-since faded. The little one that said ‘open’ and ‘closed’ hung below some façade, some…signboard above the doorway that had once been this inn’s name.\nEven if she had been able to pick out the letters, Erin felt it was in that other language. She did feel guilty, but she got to work as she set her tools down. Then she pulled something out of her pocket and grimaced.\n“Aw. The water.”\nShe had a packet of what looked, at first, to be plain white dust. And some black charcoal or other powder. But when Erin found some water and filled another bucket with it, the dust turned the water white, and the second turned another black.\nPowdered paint. Very handy, and it beat hauling a bucket of\npaint\nback all this way. Erin mixed up both, then dipped her brush into the first bucket. She gave the inn’s signboard a coating and hoped it dried as fast as Krshia claimed.\nThe inn lost its name quickly as Erin stood on a chair she propped on top of a table she’d dragged outside. She felt a pang, but it had lost that name long ago, with its customers and owner. It needed a new one, especially if she were to stay here.\nIt felt…reverential, almost. The girl picked up the bucket of black paint and the brush and thought a second. She dipped the brush in the black paint and painted a broad stroke on the wide plaque above the entranceway. She wrote the beginning of a letter, frowned at it, and then cursed and shouted obscenities and had to cover it all up with white paint again.\nIt was hard to write properly, and it took her several tries as the daylight escaped the world to finish her sign. Numerous coats of paint to cover her mistakes. Multiple tools. A paint-scraping knife to get rid of the paint when it became too thick. A hammer to hit things while she vented her frustrations.\nBut eventually, the sign was done. The young woman sighed in relief and then picked up the pieces of wood she brought with her. This was easier, so she only took the paintbrush and wrote on it briefly. Then, she planted the pieces of wood in the ground and drove the sign down with the hammer a few times.\nBy now, it was dark. So dark that Erin was yawning, hungry, and covered with paint. In defiance of any good painter or craftswomanship at all, she left the tools on the ground where they lay. Even the paint brush in the bucket.\n“Food. I hate painting.”\nThe paint was already drying, and the sign and plaque were done. The lettering was crisp and clear, and if any travellers had been present, the words would have caught the eye.\nBut there weren’t any travellers. The inn was long-deserted, and no visitors had come here for a long time.\nYet—it didn’t matter. The inn’s shuttered windows began to glow with a bit of light. As they did, a few people stopped outside the inn. Not guests. Not yet.\nJust…a young [Necromancer], rubbing at his rumbling stomach and glancing up at the new sign. He raised his brows and inspected the smaller sign. He recoiled—shook his head, and gave the inn a strange look.\nAlmost as strange as the smallest Goblin, peeking at the inn in the darkness. Her night vision was good, but even so, she had to hurry forwards when he left and puzzle out each word in the Human’s language one by one. She too stared and hurried away, just as confused.\nIt didn’t matter. The lack of guests didn’t matter. The sign was what mattered. The new name of the inn and the message mattered. They were written, now there to stay. As was the young woman.\nSo, as Erin Solstice slept, the twin moons rose, and the night sky began to brighten. The moonlight from the two moons, a pale blue and a faint green, caught the inn’s sign. The letters spelled out the new name:\nThe Wandering Inn\nNext to the inn, a large sign was hammered into the earth by the door. It read:\n“No Killing Goblins.”\nThus began the story of The Wandering Inn.\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "The wind blows through my hair as the sun rises. Past the mountain range they call the High Passes, which divides Izril in half, a fierce breeze blows north, and I wonder if it’s come all the way down from those peaks hidden among the clouds. It blows down past the screaming Goblins trying to kill me and catches an arrow mid-flight.\nThe arrow zings well wide of my face, and the wind chills the sweat on my skin. It’s a good feeling. The wind. People often underestimate how a brisk breeze can change your day.\nAnd on this day, when the sky is blue and clear without a cloud, who wouldn’t want to be outside? The air’s chilly with the hints of winter coming, and the breeze is better than air conditioning.\nIt’s a perfect day for running. I’ve run through bad days when the heat can drop a horse, and I’ve run through thunderstorms, typhoons, and even dog crap. Twice. And while I can grit my teeth and keep running even when the wind’s against me, I live for the days when it has my back.\nOh, right, the Goblins. They’re still sprinting at me, but here’s the thing—they’re short. And they’ve been waving their shortswords for the last ten minutes. Aside from the one with the bow—which is a concern despite the terrible aim—the others aren’t that quick.\nThe one in front is clutching at his side. Her side? I see a hopeful mouth of teeth turn into a smile, so I turn and start sprinting.\nThe grass is knee-high, and I grin at the\nscreech\nof dismay from behind me. I’m not sweating much despite the hard run, and my eyes fix on the ground, what I can see of it. It’s been a great run so far, despite the Goblin ambush.\nThere’s a reason my eyes are on the ground, not my pursuers. A large rock appears in the grass, and I hop over it just in time.\nCareful.\nAt the speed I’m running, I can easily break a foot if I trip over one. I’ve split my toenails more than once by kicking rocks at high speed. Not fun.\nKeep running. Actually, scratch that.\nRun faster.\nThe wind blows against my face, and I smile again. It’s the small things that make life good. Like the wind.\nThe wind cools you down. It gives you something to run against; makes you feel alive. It also helps throw off arrows when people are shooting at your face.\nAn arrow flies through the air, and I change my course slightly. It slices through the air past my left arm.\nToo close.\nI adjust my path and pick up speed. I’m nearly out of the range of the Goblins that have been hunting me. A few more seconds and I’ll lose them.\nGoblins. They’re frightening little monsters with red eyes and pointy teeth. They look more like demons, actually. But they’re real enough, and they like eating Humans and, purportedly, even worse. If they can catch them, that is.\nOne pops out of the grass as I run towards the city in the distance. It’s a larger Goblin than normal, and he’s wearing rusty chainmail and holding a short sword.\nDamn. A Hobgoblin?\nThat’s what they call them. He must have been circling around this entire time!\nHe swipes at me at knee-height, trying to cripple me, and I jump. Straight over the blade. The Goblin gapes as I land and then sprints after me.\nMy legs blur. The Goblin slices at my legs, but I’m already out of range. He runs as fast as he can, but I pull away so quickly that it’s like he’s standing still.\n“Nice try.”\nI mutter under my breath as I keep running. I don’t have the time or air to actually say that out loud, of course. Besides, I’m not good at comebacks. Or…insults. Either way.\nThe Goblin stops after a few more feet and howls at my back. I ignore him and keep running. After a while, I hear the Goblins’ shrill war cries end as they give up the chase.\nAfter what feels like a few miles or, to be more worldly, a few kilometers, I stop. I do a quick scan of the area around me. Shorter grasses dominate this gentle downwards slope. Looks like I’ve lost the Goblin tribe.\nI take a few deep breaths and wipe at my forehead. Not much sweat. Good. I’d be worried if I got tired that quickly.\n“Whew. So that was my first ambush.”\nWhat a way to start the morning. I’d be lying if I said it was normal, but I can get used to anything. I think. I could have used a bagel and some coffee on the streets of the greatest city in the world*, but this is far more exhilarating. Unless I got run over by a cab or something.\n*Obviously, New York.\nIt would have been close if they’d fully encircled me. I shouldn’t take shortcuts through the high grass like that—especially when I have such valuable cargo.\nIs that how they knew how to get me?\nI check the rucksack I’m carrying and feel a thankfully intact piece of glass inside the leather container. I don’t want to know how much I’d pay if it got broken. And it might have been why the Goblins were after me. Maybe they could detect valuable goods?\n“Or Persua, that sallow bitch, tipped them off. Nah, nevermind. Even she doesn’t talk to Goblins.”\nI shake my head. Sour grapes. I can just imagine how fuming mad she is right now since I’ve taken ‘her’ delivery. Well, I don’t think she would have enjoyed and/or survived that ambush.\nBack to running. After a few seconds, I start walking and then transition into a jog. I could take it easy now the adrenaline has left my veins, but time is money, and soon, I’m back up to speed. Not sprinting speed—I need to conserve as much energy as possible for the emergencies like Goblin attacks, Carn Wolves, bandits, Zombies, Skeletons, Crelers*, and the other nasty things that live in the plains**.\n*I’ve never actually seen these particular monsters. I’m not even sure if that name is right—they have other nicknames like ‘Tunnel Crawlers’, but they’re a world-renowned threat. Apparently they’re not something you want to meet.\n**If I make it sound horrible, it’s only because I’m aware of the possible dangers. At any given time, there’s really not that many monsters lurking around. It’s just that you never know when one will pop up. I checked a bestiary in the Adventurer’s Guild, and they have an entire tome just for the local threats.\nAnyways, I keep running. I enjoy the wind blowing through my hair for a bit and finally reach the city in question. It looks, well, like most of the settlements I’ve been to over the last week.\nTall, gray walls and spearmen and archers in towers that keep an eye out for monsters. This is Celum, or something like that. It’s a city, one of the southernmost in this region before the High Passes. They have a [Mayor], but they don’t pay fealty to any noble family directly, so that makes them a city-state*. And that’s my destination for the moment.\n*More like just a city. It’s not\nthat\nbig, but all of the cities have their own form of rule. Some are ruled by a council, others have elected leaders like we do back at home, and some still have lords and ladies, although apparently the nobility isn’t in charge everywhere, which is something. The point is they all band together if threatened, but they have their individual squabbles and goals. Just like the good old USA.\nI approach the open gates. A guard’s on duty next to a winch so he can slam the gates shut if a dangerous person approaches or if they’re really ugly, but he doesn’t even twitch as I approach.\n“Hoy there.”\nHe greets me. At least, I think it’s a greeting. It’s more like a curt nod, and he’s blinking sleepily in the dawn light. He probably hopes I’ll just trot into the city, but unluckily for us both, I’m trying to be at least somewhat responsible. I wave at him as I slow down, and he begrudgingly stands a bit taller.\nHe has…well, what I’d charitably call a ‘mustache,’ but it’s more of an attempt at one. I guess he’s either too young or not gifted with facial hair. Aside from that, he’s wearing cheap leather armor, and he has a sword. Between that Hob and this guy in a fight, I’d give it to the Hob, but that’s what walls and the other members of the guard are for, I guess.\n“Hm? Something wrong, Miss Runner?”\nHe looks me up and down, and I notice his eyes finding my feet. Bare feet. I smile at him—and my stomach clenches. I hate talking to new people, so I gesture awkwardly behind me.\n“Goblins. A few miles outside the city. A group jumped me.”\nThe [Guardsman] blinks, and suddenly, I have his attention.\n“Goblins? How many? Are you hurt, Miss?”\n“No…I don’t know, two dozen? And a big one, a Hob?”\n“Hobgoblin? Two dozen Goblins…another tribe. Dead gods, and there are [Traders] on the road. Where, exactly?”\n“The—tall grass over there? Only three miles?”\nI point in the vague direction I came, and the [Guardsman] peers as if he thinks he can see them.\n“That’s not good. We need to send a patrol out and hire a Bronze-rank team. Silver, maybe…you outran them, Miss? Did they have bows?”\n“One or two. They missed.”\nI grin, and he gives me a strange look as if he doesn’t believe me. It’s hard to hit a moving target! But then he’s looking around.\n“I need to inform the Watch Sergeant. And—could you wait here, Miss? I’ll need you to show me the rough area where they are for the Adventurer’s Guild and the Watch—”\nAh, shit. That’s what I get for trying to help. I raise my hands as I begin to jog forwards.\n“Sorry, I wouldn’t know the exact spot. Just over there. They probably ran off. Listen—I’m a City Runner. I’ve got to\ngo.\n”\n“But the Goblins—”\n“I’m on a priority delivery! For Magnolia Reinhart!”\n“Lady Reinhart?”\nThe [Guardsman] hesitates, and his face screws up in agony. Yep—this is just like home. He’s clearly weighing being responsible for me being late. He curses, then waves me through.\n“If you can circle back this way, Miss—I’m Guardsman Wesle! Any help you can render the Watch would be greatly—”\nHis voice is already receding as I hurry down the cobblestone street.\nYeah, right.\nNo offense, but I’m not walking for an hour while people say, ‘is it\nthis\npatch of grass they popped out of?’ I did my best. Won’t take this gate on the way out.\nHard cobblestone replaces grass, and I slow down a bit, cursing. Now, instead of stones or sticks, I’m looking out for bits of glass, crap, and other hazards on the street.\nFrom a fast run I slow down to a jog, but not the kind that you see on TV most of the time. I hate the stupid bouncy run actors pretend to do, which clearly misses the point of running. Jogging, like sprinting or walking or anything else, should be fluid and concise. You don’t waste energy looking like you’re standing on a pogo stick.\nThey have no form. But then, I’ve heard that said about how actors handle guns, do action fights, and about anything else. And my expertise\nis\nrunning.\nLet’s see. I’ve never been to Celum, but pedestrians are already out and about despite the early hour. Good. I’d hate to have to wait. I navigate down the streets, using the wooden signs posted above the streets for guidance. There’s a sidewalk to allow the wagons and other wheeled transports and horses to travel about, but few are on the road and I’m in a hurry, so I head straight down each street.\nIt’s great that everyone around here speaks and writes in English. How amazingly annoying* would it be if they wrote or spoke a different language? But by some contrivance of fate, English is the dominant language in this world. Of course, other languages exist, but apparently, most species know English. And they write it in Human lands.\n*And realistic.\nAnyways. As I slow down to let a cart go by, I think of what the guard said. He seemed amazed I got out of the ambush unscathed, and I have to admit—I was caught off-guard at first. Running means tunnel vision a lot of the time. And, uh, I’m bad about seeing everything at once, even when I don’t have an iPod blasting music* in my ears. Maybe I should run without my headphones in?\n*Pop. And rock. And techno, but that’s hit-or-miss. Look, if I can run to it, I will. I have a soft spot for country music, but it’s hard to keep up speed when I’m listening to a harmonica’s croon. Country is for crying or nostalgia. At least, that’s the only kind of song I download.\nAt last, I reach my destination. By which I mean I reach a tall stone façade of marble and gaze up at a fancier class of painted wood door than I’ve seen elsewhere. Unlike the other houses which enter onto the street, this is a proper mansion within the walls.\nIt has a walkway and a garden past an iron gate and more glass than any other building in the city, I swear. Whoever lives here can obviously afford it; she’s hired me. But she even has a glowing magical\nlight\nspell affixed to a little lantern next to the gate.\nA magical spell. To be precise, a glowing crystal, which is this world’s version of a lightbulb, only the glow is gentler and comes from within the entire crystal, rather than a filament burning hot with electricity.\nMagic.\nBut not everyone can afford a damn magic light. Nor is just anyone titled like the owner of this mansion. I only have to check once.\nLady Magnolia Reinhart.\nYep, this is her place. One of her places, as I understand it, but from the shockingly pink carriage* sitting to the side of the mansion…I’d guess that she’s here.\n*Garishly pink, really. I mean…there’s pink, a subtle color not often found in the natural world, and then there’s the pink you get on princess dolls. The pink that sears the eyes. That pink is on the entire damn carriage in various shades. It offends my very soul. Even the horses don’t seem to be near it; it’s unhitched, and I pity the poor people who have to stare at that all day. Some people have no taste.\nI take a few deep breaths. This is the part I hate the most. But it has to be done, so I steel myself. And hesitate. I take another deep breath, worry about hyperventilation, and then trot up the garden path and take the brass knocker and bang it a few times.\nI really do hate this part the most.",

    "text": "Celum, just past dawn.\nThe instant Lady Magnolia, a member of the Human nobility in the northern part of the continent of Izril, opened the door, she clasped her hand to her heart.\n“Oh my! Are you here with the delivery already?”\nShe personally opened the door, despite the pair of [Maids] hovering behind her and the [Butler], who stood to attention behind both. It was so fast it caught the nervous young woman outside by surprise, and she backtracked a few steps before nodding hastily.\n“City Runner at your service.”\nHer first impression of the [Lady] was of pink. A pink dress cut almost like business attire, but so shockingly vividly dyed it matched a whirlwind of curled, dirty blonde hair and stood out as the most vivid dress Ryoka had ever seen since coming to this world. The owner of the shocking colors had less vividly green eyes, but her smile engulfed all the other features. She had been smiling before the door opened and her expression seemed to dance ahead of her words.\nMagnolia Reinhart thrust the door wide and smiled as she gestured the young woman in. All three of her servants stared at the muddy feet of the City Runner, but the [Lady] barely paid any attention as she swept back inside. The entrance to one of her homes was carpeted with a long tapestry of a grand war, and she walked over the faces of brave warriors vanquishing some horrific monstrous menace with too many legs without noticing it.\nThe young woman\ndid\nnotice the carpet, nearly forty feet long, hand-sewn, and the mirrors, portraits of noble forebears of Magnolia, and the three servants, all of whom silently stood aside and bowed as she hesitated at the doorway. But Magnolia just beckoned her in, and the young woman swallowed her words as Magnolia spoke too quickly to interrupt.\n“I hadn’t expected you so soon! But where are my manners? Magnolia Reinhart, at\nyour\nservice! You are the City Runner I’ve been expecting, yes?”\nShe turned, and the young woman managed to croak out a few words, her throat tight with nerves.\n“Mm. Your seal?”\nShe set down her pack and began to open it. One of the [Maids], who had a pair of spectacles almost as severe as the frown on her face, made a displeased sound. Scandalized, even. Lady Magnolia hesitated and then touched her fingers to her brow.\n“Oh. Of course.\nSeals.\nIt’s been so long since I—I’d completely forgotten. Please come in while I fetch it.”\nThe young woman hesitated and eyed the pristine mansion behind Magnolia. It only occurred to her that she really didn’t\nneed\nto ask for a Runner’s Seal. Not from this person. She began to sweat, but it was too late. The [Lady] noticed her hesitation and glanced down. Her eyes widened slightly, but she took the moment in stride.\n“Oh, don’t worry about that. I have plenty of servants who can deal with little stains. Please, come in, come in!”\nThe young woman hesitated and then reluctantly stepped into the house. She looked up and around at the marble flooring she was currently dirtying, the fancy rugs, the tapestries on the wall, and clearly wished to be elsewhere. But Magnolia just swept towards the nearest room, a sitting chamber, and she was already fiddling around with a little pot set next to the wall.\n“Now, where did they put the seal? Normally, I’d leave this all up to my [Head Maid], Ressa, but I just\nknew\nit was my delivery. Hm…hmm…here!”\nHer hand plucked a silver-and-sapphire token from the plate. The beautiful seal was half gleaming silver, the other half a semi-translucent pool of cerulean. It looked as expensive as could be.\nMagnolia presented the token to the young woman, who received it with extreme care. Then, the [Lady] patiently waited as the young woman carefully stowed the token in a belt pouch at her waist and then undid her pack.\nIt was a backpack, but not one that would ever grace any store in the world the young woman had come from. Rather, instead of Velcro and machine-tooled stitches and individual and superfluous compartments, this pack was made of leather stitched to cloth and had all the aesthetics of a black bug crawling on her back. But it could be tightly secured with strings and opened without having to be taken off.\nCarefully, the messenger, for that was what she was, removed a heavily-wrapped item. She held it out.\n“Here, all in good order.”\nShe\nshould\nhave offered it to a servant. She should have said, ‘[Lady] Reinhart,’ or offered some courteous address. In fact, at this point it was quite acceptable for one of the [Maids] to produce a club and harry her into the street. Any other Reinhart would probably have done that, but Magnolia was smiling and took the wrapped parcel quite graciously.\n“Thank you very much, Miss Runner! Are you new to the region? I confess, I haven’t seen you around before, and I make it a point to get to know the best City Runners in the area.”\n“I’m new.”\nMagnolia waited, but nothing more was forthcoming. So she smiled and carelessly unwrapped the heavy layers of wool and string that had protected the item. The young woman blinked at the detritus littering the floor and then looked back at the package she’d so painstakingly brought this far.\nAn enameled bottle of red crystal caught the light in Magnolia’s hands and practically illuminated the foyer. It stood at odds with the liquid within, a fine, practically clear blue liquid, such that the resulting shade through the crystal bottle was a brilliant, vivid purple, far more outstanding than a mundane wine as Magnolia held it up to the light.\n“Beautiful, isn’t it?”\nMagnolia swished the blue liquid inside the bottle and smiled gently. She turned to the young woman and bowed her head slightly.\n“I can’t thank you enough for bringing this in time for brunch, Miss Runner. I’m entertaining several of my friends, and I promised them I’d share a glass of this\ndelightful\ndrink with them. I would hate to be made a liar, and they would never let me live it down. Especially Pryde. I know it was somewhat exorbitant to send for, but it is so delicious!”\nShe gestured at the blue liquid and seemed to realize the young woman had not, at this point, even seen the valuable item she was delivering unwrapped. Magnolia gestured to it lightly.\n“The wine, you see? It’s distilled from a very poisonous fruit—the Amentus fruit, I think they call it. So hard to get a hold of, but I did promise! And wouldn’t you know it, but I drank the last glass yesterday. And so I put in my request, and here you are!”\nShe beamed at the young woman. The young woman said nothing. Her left eye twitched. Magnolia peered at her and went on.\n“Please tell the Guild that I’m very happy with their efficiency.”\nNod, nod. The young woman shifted her feet and glanced towards the door. She opened her mouth again, then recited something she’d clearly just remembered.\n“Do you have another request?”\nIt was the traditional response, and Magnolia dithered.\n“Well, I suppose—but no, I don’t believe I need—well, at the moment no, but it would be a shame too—no. I suppose not.”\nThe young woman nodded and began to edge back towards the door. Magnolia was ringing a silver bell, and aproned women and an elderly gentleman were descending the stairs towards their mistress, but when she noticed the young woman leaving, she called out.\n“Won’t you stay and have a glass? I would hate to send you on your way without a little reward.”\nThe City Runner froze, mid-way out the door, and she turned with a hunted expression, clearly hoping she’d done everything. She hesitated, then finally bowed slightly, and begrudgingly, and shook her head.\n“…Sorry. I have more deliveries to make.”\nMagnolia’s face fell, but she rallied at once.\n“Then at least take this gift for your trouble. No, no! I insist.”\nShe pressed a gold coin into the young woman’s hands. The young woman tried to give it back, but Magnolia wouldn’t hear of it, so she gave up. Ryoka Griffin pocketed the coin, tried to smile, and her lips twitched.\n“Um…thanks. Bye.”\nShe headed out the door as fast as she could. Magnolia Reinhart watched her go, the bottle of Amentus Wine in her hands. She glanced at the faint stains on the carpet, but a [Maid] was already working them out with incredible speed. She sighed and handed the bottle to the [Butler], who spirited it away for later.\nMagnolia Reinhart put her hands on her hips, looking a bit amused, a bit defeated. Only now did the rest of her servants move, and the [Maid] with the spectacles came over and leaned against the wall. She folded her arms, and a slight smirk crossed her face.\n“Well, that didn’t work out like you hoped. So much for the charming [Lady] beloved by all Runners.”\nMagnolia Reinhart rolled her eyes.\n“Oh, do shut up, Ressa. You scared her off. Bare feet? Well, I have met her. Now, let’s see about entertaining Pryde, and if she disparages\nthis\ndrink, I shall toss it in her face.”\nShe turned, sighing, and cast only one last glance at the head of raven-black hair before the young woman was already fleeing back for the open road.",

    "text": "The City Runner left the mansion of a house and walked down the street. It turned into a jog as soon as she had enough room, and she moved out of the richer housing and into the common districts. There, she knocked on two more doors and, with much less conversation and a lot more efficiency, handed over a letter and a bag and received two red tokens.\nAfter all, she hadn’t just been carrying Magnolia Reinhart’s delivery alone. That was inefficient—it was just that the [Lady] had top billing.\nHer deliveries made, the young woman took care to stow both tokens in the same pouch the silver and sapphire token had gone in. She made sure the pouch was closed as well. It was crucially important that she not lose any of the tokens, or seals as they were known.\nRunner Seals. A proof of delivery. Without one of the brightly colored bits of stone, any delivery was suspect. A messenger had to deposit such seals in order to receive their reward, and so they were valuable.\nTo an extent.\nAmong the wealthier class of patrons, Runner Seals were a sign of their status and power. Merchants and bankers used lesser gemstones instead of common stone, and the most elite members of society even had their own unique form of Seal to prove delivery beyond a doubt.\nEven then, she’d probably have to swear on a truth stone the delivery had gotten to Lady Magnolia. But the Seals were still important proof of the handoff, and Magnolia’s was unique. Anyone without such means had to use the simple cut stone provided by their cities at nominal prices. These were cheap, but also meant that they could be used to prove false deliveries.\nCases of Runners taking goods and providing false Seals happened every year. Thus, trust was just as important with Runners. Their reputation for honesty was a key part of receiving individual contracts, just as much if not more so than their ability to deliver packages quickly.\nStreet Runners were different from City Runners, though, and in her case, she was more trusted. But you had to keep proving that.\nThe young woman set off for a different gate than the one she’d come in from. She was tired. Not physically tired, but drained from the effort of interacting. Her pace picked up as she went out the gate, and soon, she was running down a well-worn road that would lead her back to her city. She wanted to make more deliveries today, and so she had to beat the midday rush on requests if she wanted to get any of the profitable ones.\nShe was a messenger. Or Runner, as they were referred to. Street Runner, City Runner, even Courier were their designations—and a whole host of rude words whenever they ran into someone.\nShe preferred to think of herself as, simply, a Runner. Because she was a runner, and running was what she loved to do. The deliveries she could take and mostly leave, unless it was the wrong address. Or the deliveree was dead. That had happened once, already.\nThe point is she was running, and there was a breeze in her face. At a moment like this, she could ignore the fact that she was in another world, or that she had no way to get back, or even that the Goblins were chasing her again. She was running, and she was free.\nShe was also barefoot.\nHer name was Ryoka Griffin, a name which she hated, hence her refusal to really give it out to people. She enjoyed running, not talking to people, and her hobbies included not mentioning her name, running, disappointing her parents, drinking coffee, running, and anti-sociability. She was, currently—\nRunning.\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "Every head in the Runner’s Guild turned as the door opened. It was a conditioned response; those who ran were either quick to notice things or they were dead.\nUnlike adventurers, Runners didn’t slay monsters, but there were requests posted that weren’t average letter deliveries. Emergency rush jobs, dangerous assignments all went there, and naturally, the Runners who were relaxing between gigs sat at the tables and talked, watching the bulletin board, exchanging interesting tidbits, and listening for hot gossip.\nEverything could be sold for a profit, and while there was such a thing as the Runner’s Handbook, some Runners were less upstanding and would crack open a delivery and see if it was worth ‘losing.’\nMost were trustworthy, and a Runner’s Guild like this one, in the city of Remendia, was more well-known than the city itself. After all, Runners went everywhere, and so any City Runner in the region—even Couriers—might walk through these doors.\nToday, the newcomer was a young woman. Again, not unusual, but she still stood out from the other Runners present. Her skin was a light brown, and her hair was black, reaching down her back in a ponytail. She looked—different.\nDrathian\n, perhaps, was the guess of most, but she stood out around the crowds of fairer skin tones in general and hair that ran from fiery red to brown, and occasionally, more magical colors as well.\nHer feet were bare, another departure from the norm. No one ran barefoot. Only a Centaur would be that crazy, and there was only one Centaur in all of the north who was a Runner. At six feet and one inch, the young woman had long, long legs, but they were Human, not equine.\nHer eyes were bright green, like green turquoise, dancing with amusement when she was excited or happy. Narrowed and sharply hostile when she was upset. She did not often look happy, but her default expression was of a half-frown, a blank look that clearly said she did not want to talk.\nThe final notable thing was—or had been—her clothing and the odd, rectangular object and device which sometimes could be seen attached to her ears. It was the oddest thing, a bright red piece of string that looked magical. The same with her clothing, which had been brightly dyed and expensive-looking—until she’d bought some conventional leggings and a simple, off-grey tunic to run in. She shrugged the rucksack she carried onto one shoulder and glanced around as the door swung closed.\nRyoka walked over to a counter on one side of the room, ignoring the appraising looks she received. She waited until the female receptionist at the counter looked up. The woman had a uniform, a green vest over a white undershirt, that made her look like an official attendant. Which she was. She even had a hat with the Runner’s Guild logo on it and the local city’s emblem.\nThe moment of inspection turned relaxed, despite the appraisal of Ryoka herself. She was one of their own and not a threat. Not that you were supposed to be attacked here, but gossip was the only thing faster than Runners. And for exciting things to break up the humdrum lives of the small towns or cities in this area, you should sit in either the Adventurer’s Guild to see someone taking on a request to slay a monster or enter a dungeon, the Mage’s Guild to hear gossip or events from further around the world relayed by [Message] spells, or the Runner’s Guild, where valuable items or sometimes letters with profound impacts on events were entrusted to the people inside.\nYou could tell who belonged here, because they were almost always wearing light clothing meant for prolonged travel. They looked fit—they spent most of their day exercising—and they were a kind of unique subset of almost any settlement.\nRunners. You could spot them by appearance, just like this ubiquitous building, which was open, flat, with a small second floor devoted to offices and managerial work or private meeting rooms.\nA Runner’s Guild could be found in every city of Izril. The bottom floor was where everything was done, and it was dominated by several counters along one side of the room and a kind of bar and meeting space on the other side.\nAppropriately, this had once been a tavern, and it still was. Runners, notable by their worn shoes, light clothing, and, usually, athleticism, lounged or stood in groups when they weren’t clustering at the desks.\nRyoka barely looked twice at any of the other Runners, and she didn’t greet anyone by name, but the woman at the desk clearly knew her.\n“Good morning, Miss Ryoka.”\nThe [Receptionist] treated her to a friendly smile. She smiled in a determined way that said she knew she might not get a response. Ryoka nodded back. She did not smile.\n“Hi.”\nA pause, so infinitesimal, but noticeable, and the [Receptionist] moved forwards.\n“It’s a pleasure to see you’re doing well! Do you have any requests to turn in? Magnolia Reinhart’s delivery…?”\nRyoka nodded again.\n“Three seals. I got it to her.”\n“Very well. I’ll witness your claim.”\nThe receptionist waited patiently as Ryoka scribbled down her name and listed the seals she’d brought in. She had to write down the composition of each seal. Two red hardwood seals and the expensive silver-sapphire seal.\nEach desk had a [Receptionist], a trained man or woman—all Human, here—who would take Runner’s Seals, hand out coins, or head into the back to retrieve a bundle of letters, a wrapped item, and give a Runner instructions on where to go.\nThere were maps on the far walls showcasing various cities, and often, a pin would be stuck into the worn paper showcasing some natural or monstrous threat. [Bandit] groups, some idiot [Hunter] leaving snares unattended, and so on. Next to those maps was the last fixture of both Runner and Adventurer’s Guilds: a bulletin board made of cork from which delivery requests hung.\nBut the\nreal\npaperwork and coordination of information and items was done behind the polished desk counter, and the woman had a ledger out and was jotting down a few notes in moments.\n“\nWonderful.\nYou were lucky to pick up that delivery for Lady Reinhart. She was pleased, I hope?”\n“Yep.”\nRyoka finished writing and slid the paper and quill over to the receptionist. The other woman’s smile flickered, but she added her own signature to the log. She kept speaking, as if trying to coax a longer response out with sheer momentum.\n“Most Runners fight over the right to deliver something to her. She pays extra for speed, and of course, she’s been known to tip generously too. You’re all signed out.”\nThe receptionist waited for a response. She got a silent nod.\n“Thanks.”\nThe [Receptionist] sighed. Someone else gave her a sympathetic look, but only just. A male [Receptionist] had breathed a sigh of relief not to get the surly newcomer at his station. Then again—she was efficient, but he had long since given up even trying for smalltalk.\nThe City Runner turned away. She began to stride over to the far end of the room—then halted. Reluctantly, she peered over her shoulder. Then she came marching straight back.\nA Street Runner, all nerves, fourteen years old, was queueing up for the female [Receptionist]’s attention next, but he backed up as the City Runner marched straight back into spot. The [Receptionist] hesitated.\n“Something else, Miss Griffin?”\n“Yeah. Goblins. I ran into a small tribe outside of Celum in the tall grass. A Hob, some Goblins. One had a bow. They jumped me, but I got out of it. The Watch knows, but put up a notice.”\nGoblins?\nThe Street Runner and a few heads turned at this commonplace threat. That did get the other [Receptionist]’s attention. In a trice, the woman at the counter had a map out and was asking Ryoka to pinpoint the area.\n“You escaped a Goblin ambush?\nAnd\na Hob? Are you sure it was a Hob?”\n“He was taller than me, so yeah. Had a sword, shield…decent armor.”\n“That’s no good. How did they sneak up on you?”\nRyoka grimaced as if it were a personal failing.\n“They were lying in the grass. Leapt up and almost stabbed me. I outran them. I don’t know where they went.”\nSome of the Runners inspected Ryoka as she pointed out the location and turned away. She didn’t\nlook\nfrazzled for someone who’d survived a Goblin ambush. Even a small group could kill a City Runner, and she’d outrun them? No emergency alchemy items or Skills?\nThe [Receptionist] looked approving.\n“No wonder you made City Runner so quick! I’ll let the local Runners know to watch out.”\n“Eh. They weren’t that fast.”\nRyoka shrugged and stepped back again. She headed over to the large bulletin board with the requests on it, ignoring the stares and murmurs. Ryoka peered at the bits of paper and looked for anything exciting.\nLike the Adventurer’s Guilds, the Runner’s Guild used a first-come-first-serve system when it came to giving out delivery requests. It was this board that Ryoka studied intently, ignoring the eyes still boring into the back of her head. She was used to them.\nWhat she wasn’t used to was the loud, cheerful voice that cut through the silence.\n“Hey, Ryoka!”\nThe young woman tensed up. Her head twitched towards the door, but it was too late. Another girl was making a beeline towards her. She was shorter than Ryoka, but wider. Not from fat; rather, she looked sturdy. So sturdy that her pack was three times the size of Ryoka’s, and even without a high-grade bag of holding, she ran ore and heavy deliveries for the Merchant’s Guild on a regular basis.\nGaria Strongheart slapped Ryoka on the shoulder. The taller girl’s left eye twitched, but Garia didn’t notice.\n“Did you just finish your deliveries to Celum? That’s fast! I normally have a bite to eat in the markets. They do a wonderful cinnamon bun in the mornings, but I guess you already ate, right?”\nThe taller girl looked over at Garia and gave her a fractional nod. Garia made a show of studying Ryoka’s bare feet; she had good, worn shoes, the closest this world had to sneakers without plastic. Comfortable, shaped leather, undyed but buffed shiny from so much wear.\n“Mhm.”\n“And you did it barefoot? I thought the others were just playing a prank on me when they said you ran everywhere without shoes.”\nRyoka sighed inaudibly.\n“I run everywhere without shoes.”\n“Why? Too cheap for them?”\nGaria laughed. Ryoka did not. Her voice took on an element of strained patience which Garia noticed.\n“I’m just slower with shoes, that’s all.”\nLike the [Receptionist], Garia tried. She put on a smile and felt around in one pocket.\n“Oh, so it’s a class thing? That makes sense. But is the, uh, [Barefoot Runner] class better than the [Messenger] class?”\nRyoka shrugged. Below the bulletin board’s specific requests were listings of each Runner’s Guild and how many letters or bulk-delivery parcels were waiting. Ryoka did some math, calculating how much she could carry. You could pay for a bulk-delivery to another city, and whichever Runner picked it up would get a smaller fee, but it was reliable work.\nThe taller girl’s continuing silence and clear disinterest in conversation didn’t bother Garia, at least outwardly. The friendly girl continued to press Ryoka, asking about the road, what dangers she’d encountered, and so on. She got monosyllabic responses if she were lucky. But Garia had a secret weapon today.\n“How about a\nnali-\nstick, Ryoka? My dad’s a [Farmer]—I told you, remember? He was trying to grow some on his farm, but most didn’t grow well. It’s\nsuper\nsweet. Want some?”\nShe pulled a thin, pale stalk of something out of her pocket and offered Ryoka a bite. The other young woman hesitated and eyed the unusual food, but she raised a hand.\n“Pass.”\nGaria looked disappointed and took a bite. Instantly, her eyes went wide with a sugar rush. She missed Ryoka’s vague look of disappointment. The City Runner shifted, and one foot silently kicked the other.\nRyoka went back to studying the requests. Most were generic delivery requests. Unfortunately, they were all spaced out so that it would be hard to do more than a few without running twice as far.\nA scrap of paper hiding behind two other requests caught her eye. Ryoka pulled it out and studied it. Then she showed it to Garia.\n“What’s the reward for this one?”\nGaria looked at the piece of paper and shook her head.\n“Oh that? It’s one of the old-style requests. You get them now and then. Someone sends a [Message] that they want a delivery and they promise payment. But we have no idea how much they’re willing to pay and who they want the package delivered to. At least it’s confirmed.”\n“Confirmed?”\n“That means we can at least prove they’re not [Bandits]. Who’s this one from? Oh. Don’t take this request.”\n“Why not?”\nGaria had instantly spotted the delivery location, and she tapped it.\n“It’s for the High Passes. I know you’re not local to here, but you know the High Passes?”\nShe pointed to one of the windows and the huge mountain range to the south. Ryoka had seen it; no one could miss it. Garia went on, looking solemn.\n“Very nasty place. More Runners have died there than—well, it’s bad. Tons of monsters live around the area. It’s a Gold-rank threat. Or…\nNamed-rank.\nEven a Courier wouldn’t do that lightly. How much do they want?”\n“Hmm. It says the price is ‘to be agreed upon.’ But they’re offering twenty gold just to visit…”\nGaria laughed.\n“\nTwenty gold?\nThat’s a fortune for City Runners—and way too little to risk for the High Passes! This has to be a joke. No one lives there. Here—”\nShe plucked the piece out of Ryoka’s grip and stuck it back under the other requests where it belonged.\n“Maybe if we get a famous Courier like Tritel, the Moonlight Rider, he’ll take a look, but otherwise, I bet it’s a prank. Like asking someone to visit the moon.”\nRyoka’s expression didn’t change as her eyes flicked to the buried request, but she nodded. Then she looked elsewhere. Garia picked out another request and showed it to Ryoka.\n“How about you and I do this delivery of ore to Pelingor? It would be a long haul, but they’re offering a gold coin for delivery today! Plus the roads are very safe. Whaddya say?”\nThe other girl studied the notice and eyed the packs waiting against one wall. A valuable delivery was often stored in the back rooms…but the ore samples bound for Pelingor were just light enough that they didn’t warrant a wagon or caravan from the Merchant’s Guild, the slowest method of transit.\nBarely light enough.\nEach one probably weighed fifty pounds. More? They were filled to bursting and were as heavy as they looked.\n“I’ll pass.”\n“Again?”\nGaria looked disappointed. Ryoka shrugged awkwardly.\n“I’m not good at running in groups. Or with that much weight.”\n“Well, if you’re sure. But we should run together sometime. How about in a few days we do the Tern Road run and deliver the spices to Celers and Remendia?”\nAgain, Ryoka’s expression didn’t change, but she looked up at the ceiling as she considered Garia’s request.\n“Fine.”\nGaria beamed and slapped Ryoka on the back. Again, the other girl’s eye twitched.\n“Great! I’ll let you know when it comes up.”\n“Sure.”\nRyoka selected a piece of paper as Garia turned away. But then the door opened, and she heard Garia call out. This time, her shoulders\ndid\nhunch, and she closed her eyes in resignation.\n“Fals!”\nMore Runners walked into the guild. Their arrival was greeted with much more enthusiasm and energy than Ryoka’s had been. A few other Runners moved over as the three people who had entered strolled up to the receptionist’s counter and offered her silver seals.\nGaria joined the group around the Runners and grinned up at the tallest one. He was a blond, tanned Runner with long legs and a red shirt and long, grey rose leggings that were better quality than the other Runners around him.",

    "text": "A striking look that said he wasn’t as wary about being picked out at a distance as a Runner. For further proof he was capable of defending himself, he also wore two daggers at his belt. Neither one was enchanted, but he’d used them to defend himself more than once. He’d even slain a Creler and claimed the bounty when it jumped him, or so the local rumors went.\n“Fals, how’re you doing?”\nFals grinned at Garia and exchanged slaps on the shoulder. He pointed to the other two Runners accompanying him, a young man and a woman.\n“We just finished a run to a group of adventurers out near the old ruins. Albez? They bought a bunch of potions and supplies.\nAnd\ntipped well, so we’re going to celebrate.”\nGaria sighed enviously.\n“And you don’t have a scratch on you.”\n“We’re not stupid enough to get near the monsters. I saw a few undead, but we kept well clear of them.”\nFals laughed, and the other Runners laughed with him.\n“So why are you here? Going to accept another assignment?”\nHe shook his head.\n“Nah. I’m too tired for that. No, I just wanted to have a word with our newest Runner here.”\nHe walked over to Ryoka. The other Runners who’d congregated around him fell away, leaving just his two friends and Garia.\n“Ryoka, how’re you doing?”\nThe other girl had finished picking out two requests. She looked up from stowing the deliveries in her backpack.\n“Fine.”\nFals waited, but that was it. Garia shifted uncomfortably, and the other two Runners glared at Ryoka. She looked expressionlessly back at them. However, Fals took the lapse in stride.\n“Good, good. I was wondering if you needed any advice, what with you being so new. Normally, most Runners begin as Street Runners first. But you impressed the Guildmaster so much you made City Runner in two weeks. It was that or you’d run the rest of the Street Runners out of business!”\nRyoka shrugged. Again, Fals broke the silence before it grew too onerous.\n“Well, I noticed you took Magnolia’s request this morning. It’s a good run, isn’t it?”\n“There were a few Goblins on the road.”\n“Right, right.”\nFals scratched his head and shifted uncomfortably. Ryoka finished tying her pack closed and hoisted it onto her shoulders. She looked at him expectantly.\n“The thing is, it’s a really good delivery. It pays well, it’s safe—well, mostly safe—and Runners like Magnolia. She tips well and shares her deliveries.”\nGaria grinned.\n“She once gave me a few treats she imported from overseas. They were frozen bits of fruit and sugar. Tasted amazing.”\nFals nodded knowingly.\n“Exactly. We all like her. I know she wanted someone to deliver that blue drink she likes so much. Did she share any with you?”\nRyoka shook her head.\n“I wasn’t interested.”\nThis time, she definitely got a glare from every Runner in earshot. Fals shifted again. He lifted a hand and glanced around, smiling peaceably, and stepped closer to Ryoka. She, accordingly, stepped back, but the other Runners turned away as Fals spoke a touch more seriously.\n“Right, well, it would just be best if you let another Runner take the request next time. Not that you don’t have a right to it—it’s just that we like to share the request. Give others a chance to take it easy, okay?”\nHe gave her a smile which went unreturned. Garia eyed Ryoka nervously. Ryoka stared at Fals expressionlessly and then nodded.\n“Got it.”\nThe two other Runners accompanying Fals shifted on their feet. They looked at Ryoka with a lot more hostility than Fals and Garia. For his part, Fals nodded and gave Ryoka another friendly smile.\n“Just so you know. Good luck on your run! Let’s have a drink next time, alright?”\nFals and the other Runners walked away. Ryoka watched them go. Her face betrayed no emotion, but Garia saw her hand go up and tug at one ear. She made a vexed expression—until she noticed Garia staring at her. Then she turned hurriedly and strode for the door. She glanced back once at Garia and nodded.\n“See ya.”",

    "text": "What was the receptionist’s name? It’s still bugging me. I think it started with an ‘S’. Or was it a ‘Y’? No. I’m sure it was an ‘S’.\nEither way, at least that’s done with. And now I can get out of the city and away from annoying people*.\nI feel a lot better as I jog out of the city gates. Running calms me down. And I need some calming down after having to deal with idiots**.\n*Everyone\n**Almost everyone.\nOkay, okay, calm down. I adjust my pace as I sprint out of the city gates. People are staring. Not that it matters too much, but I don’t want to waste my energy running too fast right now.\nDestination: Wales. It’s about thirty miles away, which makes it one of the furthest cities to travel to. I’ll get over there in a few hours and then jog over to its neighbor, Ocre. Or whatever it’s called. But I’ll stay the night in Wales since it’s bigger and has better inns.\nThere’s a Runner’s Guild in Wales. There’s one in almost every big city, so I can receive more requests wherever I go. That’s handy, and it means I don’t have to come back here and deal with the annoying Runners around here.\nThen again, they all do city-to-city deliveries as well, so I tend to run into all of them sooner or later. It’s a pain.\nWell, Garia isn’t a pain. She’s just too friendly. But she’s the best of them. The rest of the City Runners can go to hell. Especially Fals.\nCity Runners. From what I understand of these Runners, they’re like postmen. Or postwomen. Whichever. But you can divide them into roughly three categories. There are the Street Runners, the City Runners, and the Couriers.\nStreet Runners cover individual cities and don’t stray outside of them very far. They take the safest, easiest jobs and receive the least amount of money. They also seem like they’re not that high in the social hierarchy in the Runner’s Guild. They’re the youngest or the oldest, and that’s about all I know.\nCity Runners are what I guess I fall into. They—we run from city to city and make deliveries in a general area. A City Runner might run for a few days if they have to make a really long delivery, but they won’t stray from their ‘territory’*. They take on the more dangerous jobs, but again, they’re not adventurers, so a City Runner mainly runs away from any trouble and tries to make their deliveries as quickly as possible.\n*Territory. What are we, dogs? But apparently we are, with all the little groups and infighting the Runners seem to do. It’s a mess of politics and friendships in each Runner’s Guild.\nThen there’s Couriers. I haven’t personally met one, but I hear they’re the equivalent of long-distance mail. They can go from one end of the continent to the other or even across the sea, if their delivery calls for it. They’re quick, efficient, and apparently they cost incredible amounts of money to hire. But they’re also supposed to be really good at their jobs.\nI want to be one. If only because they don’t have a clique and they make their own rules.\nFrom what Garia told me, each one is at least Level 30, and they all have levels in other classes as well, so they’re not easy to ambush. And that’s…\nI look around as I run. I’m going down one of the main roads, but it’s empty at the moment. Still, I jog off the road and into the short grass. It’s not like I’ll go much slower out here. I wait until I’m a ways away from the road before I shout.\n“That’s so\nstupid!\n”\nWell, it’s not much of a shout. It’s hard to shout and breathe at the same time, and it feels really awkward to talk to myself. Who does that? Anyways, I’m still not over it.\nLevels. It’s one of the weirdest things about this world, and this is a weird world. It’s like a game, but it’s not a game. At least, there’s no evil demon lord or end of the world coming, and I’m no hero from another planet summoned to defend this place from evil.\nI’m a girl from California. I should be a freshman in college in New York, and I was running barefoot around the track on my\nfirst day\nwhen I ended up here. One second I was doing a lap, the next, I ended up in this crazy place with my iPhone, my wallet, and my watch. Some might call this destiny or fate. I think it was a mistake.\nI’m no hero, but this place is exactly like a video game. Or, failing that, a fantasy book. Something out of Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings, except the cities I’ve visited don’t have any Elves or Dwarves. In fact, they don’t even have many Humans with skin darker than tan. I’m practically an outsider because I look Asian. Not that this is the most homogenous place ever*, but I still stand out.\n*Thankfully. But it seems like this continent’s equivalent to Europe? Europe with hints of globalization, but I’ve been told I’d ‘fit in’ more on another continent. By Persua, predictably.\nBack to the road. It’s not good to stray too far from it, I guess. I hate having to dodge around wagons and listen to every idiot I meet shout at me about my bare feet. But it beats Goblins, I guess.\nBarely.\nAnyways, what was I thinking about? Oh yeah. This is a stupid world. A really stupid one, and the worst part is that it’s just like the one I left.\nFals. He was hinting—no, he was telling me not to take any more of the good delivery requests. And judging by the crowd back in there, they all think the same way. Did they nominate him to ‘warn’ me? Of course they did.\nPolitics. No one takes all the good deliveries or we’ll make life tough for you, huh? And this Fals is their…what? He’s popular, I know.\nI grit my teeth. I don’t like him. He’s always giving me advice, usually about things I should or shouldn’t do. And since he’s a senior Runner, he’s got some kind of priority with deliveries and everything else. I really hate running into him in the guilds.\nAlready. It’s only been two weeks and a bit*, but I’ve gotten used to this world, at least a bit. You really can get used to anything. But I’ve never liked social climbing, and it feels like half of being a Runner is doing just that.\n*Has it really only been that long? It feels…so much longer.\nI hate Fals. I run into him too much. And now, I’ve got to run with Garia, dragging a massive backpack thirty miles for terrible pay. Why did I agree to run with her? Because it was too hard to say no.\nDamn. Damn me, damn her, and Fals can…there’s not enough damnation around here for him. I hate all of this. Just let me\nrun\nin peace.\nSo I run. Keep running. I increase my pace, and my thoughts flow out of my head. That’s better.\nThings come and go, but at least I can run. Ironically, in this world, I can run even\nmore\nsince it’s now my job. That’s the only good thing about my predicament. The only good thing.\nWell, that and one more little fact. I grin as I remember, and a wagon driver gives me a weird look as I run past him.\nThis world has a bunch of Runners. And they’re okay. They really are. They run far, and the ones like Garia are tough and strong enough to run with huge bags on their back for quite a long way. But you know what? Maybe it’s their diets. Or maybe they don’t know about proper hydration, running form, or—\nThe point is, they’re okay. But they’ve got nothing on a girl who earned a scholarship for track and field. At least—the low-level ones don’t. The high-level ones with Skills?\nI’ve yet to meet one that can beat me so far.\nI take off, and the miles flow behind me like rain. I may not be a social runner or even liked. At all. But I’m pretty sure that I’m one of the fastest.",

    "text": "It’s a long run. But I get it done with and enter Wales just as the sun’s turning the sky orange. Two deliveries. One here, and the other in that other city. Ocres? Whatever.\nI take care of it and then turn in my seals at the local Runner’s Guild. Here I get more silent stares, but that’s fine. Keep the poker face up, turn in the seals, and leave.\nThat done, I find an inn. Hm. The first one I go to advertises bed and board for three silver coins. It’s pricy, but I’ve earned over thirty silver today. I’ll treat myself.\nIf you’ve got the motivation and you don’t die from being shanked by a Goblin hiding in the grass, a City Runner can make good money. True, a large part of my earnings was from that Magnolia request, but I still earn more than most people. Or so I gather.\nThe average worker makes about 3-4 silver coins* per day. But that’s a pittance compared to what merchants or shopkeepers can bring in. Even taking away their daily expenses, they probably earn upwards of twenty silver coins each day. And\nthat’s\nsmall change compared to the money adventurers can make.\n*Local currencies differ from city to city or by region. It’s still gold, silver, and copper, but some denominations have a unique weight and percentage of actual silver or gold used in each coin. Those who deal with money a lot care about the currency, but they’re all roughly silver, gold, and copper coins.\nThe famous adventurers. Heroes. People who can slice, dice, and blast things apart. I think about them as I soak in one of the public bathhouses. It feels great, but what was I—oh, right.\nAdventurers. They don’t exactly look like the flashy characters with insane armor and gigantic swords you see in video games. Mainly, they look like medieval soldiers. At least, the low-level ones do. Again, Garia tells me the high-level ones look really impressive, but I’ve yet to meet one of those.\nAnd why am I thinking of adventurers? And where’s the towel? And is that bath attendant giving me a dirty look?\nOh, right. Because of my feet. Hey, they’re dirty but probably less dirty than other people’s disgusting body parts. Leave a tip? I guess.\nBack to the thinking. Adventurers? Yeah, they’re like…starving artists? They don’t earn much from hunting monsters, but the ones who survive their raids on dungeons or old ruins can earn unimaginable amounts of wealth in an instant. I guess it’s appealing for people who think they’ll survive. Not me, thanks. I’ve heard what Goblins do with people, and they’re the weakest monsters around.\nSo, if adventurers represent the top earners, Runners fall somewhere around the mid-categories. It’s a dangerous job, but not nearly as dangerous as fighting monsters.\nWhy do I care? Oh, right, money. I’ve got enough.\nBack to the inn. I’m tired, but my mind is still racing. It’s been how many hours? I’m still annoyed by those idiots back in the Runner’s Guild. And Garia. I’m more annoyed than mad at her, but—\nShe’s so fascinated by me. Why? Because I look foreign? Or is it me running barefoot? It’s not common even in fantasy worlds, I guess. At least she’s polite about it.\nDamnit, I wanted to try that\nnali\n-stick. But then I’d have had to get her a present or something—better not to. Was it just sugarcane? Do they\nhave\nsugar in this world?\nBack to the inn. Time for a meal. Let’s eat and think. What kind of meal? Chicken. I could go for chicken and mashed potatoes. It tastes good, especially since I’m hungry. But focus. Is that guy staring at my breasts? Yes. I hate you, random stranger.\nIgnore him. Eat chicken. Gravy goes on top of potatoes. Think.\nLet’s go over it again. Priorities. First and most important? Money to live on. Right now, I’m earning enough for a room at an inn and regular meals, but keep saving.\nSecond, I need more information. Libraries don’t exist around here, or at least, they aren’t open for the public. I need maps, but I also need a book on the cities around here. History, culture—I need a local. Can’t ask them too much, or they’ll get suspicious. Put that one on the backburner.\nNext? Um. Equipment. The job I’ve got is pretty much the only one I can do. Alternatives? I could be a scribe…if my handwriting were better. But being able to write more than my name is helpful. Too bad it’s not too useful.\nFocus. Equipment. There’s magical items on sale in the markets. Not many—and they’re expensive. But Runners have different kinds of enchanted items. I want one. But I’m still trying to earn enough money to buy a good healing potion for emergencies. That has to be the first priority.\nMeal’s done. Do I leave the plate or…? Hm. Let’s see. Looks like they’re leaving plates. And the innkeeper puts it on my tab…? Yeah. I’ll pay it tomorrow.\nBack up to my room, away from prying eyes and people who want to sit and have a drink with me. I’m not against drinking*, but I really don’t need to deal with lonely men right now.\n*Well, I am if it’s alcohol.\nMy bed’s pretty good this time. You definitely get what you pay for. I guess I’ll spend at least two silver coins on my inn from now on. It’s expensive, but it beats a bad bed.\nHm. Final check before I have to sleep. Fals? Hate him. Got to run with Garia sometime. Get it over with. Using money for…healing potion. And then equipment. Right.\nI know what to do tomorrow. I’ll go to the Runner’s Guild first thing and get some good, high-paying requests. Save up, buy that healing potion. But something else nags me as I lie in the bed with a feather poking the back of my head.\nHere’s the problem. And it’s a big one. I have no idea what to do next. Not ‘next’ as in tomorrow, but ‘next’ as in what I should be aiming for in the future. I can earn enough money to live off of, but what’s my end goal? To live and die here? Or to return home? And how in the blue blazes* am I going to do that?\n*Where does that quote come from? No, focus. Focus.\nWhen I run, I can keep the doubts from floating about in my head. But when I stop and when I’m about to sleep, I feel them crawling back up from the depths.\nUncertainty. I still don’t know why I’m here, what magic or fate brought me to this place, or even what to do next. I earn money and I keep it, but I don’t know what to do with it. I run and run, and someday I’ll run into something nasty. This world is full of monsters, and I don’t know what to do.\nStill, I can’t worry about it now. I have to sleep. If I’m tired or I oversleep tomorrow, I’ll miss the good deliveries.\nI close my eyes. Time to sleep. My mind is racing, but at least my body’s tired. I’m drifting off on my mattress. It’s not that much different from my one back at home to be honest. Maybe more lumpy and less comfortable as a whole, but it will do. And I’m so tired.\nDamn. I forgot. Before I sleep. Concentrate.

    "text": "Two nights later, Erin had to concede that being an innkeeper was harder than it looked. And it looked really hard.\n“What good is owning an inn without customers?”\nErin sighed and leaned back in her chair. She eyed the gleaming wooden floor and stout wooden door and wondered whether it was worth cleaning them again. But no, she’d dusted and polished every available surface, and she had enough food in the kitchen for a small army.\nWhat she didn’t have was money or people willing to spend money. And it occurred to her, belatedly, that if you had food, there was a definite time limit on how long you had until it went bad—and then you’d wasted your money.\n“Two days.”\nErin put her head in her hands glumly. Two days since she’d painted her sign and named the inn. Two days, and her only customers were the three terrors that plagued her waking nightmares.\nRelc, Klbkch, and Pisces. They were all horrible customers. Each one was fine on his own—well, Pisces was annoying no matter what—but as patrons, they had extremely objectionable flaws. Even Klbkch.\nEspecially Klbkch.\nIt wasn’t that they were annoying, per se, but…no, they were annoying. Erin gritted her teeth. She wished the Goblins would stop by for a change of pace. At least they were clean, quiet, and finished everything on their plate.\nWell, Relc always finished everything on his plate. So did the other two, but in Relc’s case, he tended to spread the contents of his plate on the table and the floor. How hard was it to use a knife and fork?\nAnd the one who did use a knife and fork never paid for anything. Ever. Erin felt like she was running a soup kitchen every time she fed Pisces.\nAs for Klbkch, that…that…\n“That lying, pasta-eating, snake-ant jerk!”\nErin slapped the table. She was especially mad at him. How could he betray her expectations like that?\nShe’d been happy to feed him pasta all night long. Happy that was, until Pisces and Relc told her that Antinium couldn’t handle bread or pasta that well. They were all naturally gluten-intolerant. Eating pasta was about as fun for Klbkch as poking his tongue with a knife. If he had a tongue.\nPasta wasn’t technically poison for him, but it made Klbkch lethargic and did nasty things to his digestion. Either way, he’d clearly been buying and eating her food just to support her.\nThe nerve. The\ngall\nof that bug. Ants were bugs, right?\nWhen she’d found out about Klbkch’s aversion to pasta, she’d gotten into a huge fight with him. Or rather, she’d gotten mad and he’d apologized repeatedly. Ever since then, Erin had let him buy blue fruit juice or blue fruits, but no more pasta. The trouble with that was that Erin lost out on one of her major sources of income, as Relc visited every other day and Pisces came by too frequently.\n“Another night without customers.”\nErin groaned to herself as she stared at her inn. Then she got up, found a mug, and mechanically wiped it with a clean piece of cloth. Not because it was dirty; it just felt like an innkeeper-y thing to do. And she was bored.\n“What I wouldn’t give for one customer.”\nTwo tables over, Pisces looked up from his bowl of onion and sausage soup.\n“I am right here, you know.”\nErin glared at him. Pisces was, as always, camped at his table, which meant that he somehow occupied the\nentire\ntable. Not that he stretched out or lay across multiple chairs, but he seemed to occupy too much space.\nHis stained ‘white’ robes had left another trail of detritus when he’d come in, and he’d actually removed one of his worn boots to inspect a sock with holes in it. Erin stared at a pale, pink toe and then at Pisces. He waggled the toe at her along with one eyebrow and had the nerve to look offended.\n“I meant a\npaying\n, nice customer.”\nThe young man sniffed and drank the last dregs from his bowl. The one positive aspect about the mage—if you could call it that—was that he ate like a starving wolverine.\n“I believe there is a lovely tradition known as a ‘tab.’ Rest assured, I will make sufficient payment to you in time, good mistress. Although, I must say you could stand to improve the variety of your dishes. Pasta and soup are all very well, but I trust you do know there are other types of food in the world?”\nErin ground her teeth together. She pointed at the door.\n“Out.”\nPisces stood with offended dignity and brushed off his dirty robe. He offered Erin a bow that was sardonic without being offensive enough for a thumping.\n“Your soup was most adequate. However, I would advise you to add more seasonings to combat the bland taste.”\nErin opened her mouth, but he was already halfway out the door. She watched it close…but not all the way. The door hung about a foot open as Pisces ambled off. This time, Erin punched the table.\nAfter she’d closed and bolted the new door Klbkch had helped her install, Erin tasted the cold soup and made a face. She stomped over to her shelves and looked for a bag of salt.\nCooking was harder than it looked. And sadly, while Erin could make several dishes thanks to her Skill, there wasn’t really any point if no one but Pisces was going to eat it. Today, she’d tried out soup, and she had half a pot still sitting in the kitchen. She’d have to wait for Relc to come by tomorrow to finish it all.\nErin sighed and sat down at her table. It was her favorite table, the second one near the bar. It was in the best condition, and she would nap with her head resting on the table or in the kitchen, on the floor. True, she could have built a more formal sleeping spot or done something about the second floor, but she was out of money for things like mattresses and pillows. For now, she slept. Her life wasn’t bad. She’d survived Goblins and actually started running a business. She just wished—\nShe just wished things would start going her way.",

    "text": "The next day Erin woke up, she woke up tired. Very tired. And that was strange, because Erin had gotten a good night’s sleep. Or so she’d thought.\nAs Erin shifted to get up, she felt uncomfortable. She looked down at her clothes. She was wearing a variation of a t-shirt and pants she’d custom-ordered from one of the Gnolls that Krshia had introduced her to.\nMost Drakes went for an ancient-Greek-style toga or robe look, and their clothes were long and free-flowing. Some of them wore sarongs, but Erin was pretty sure it was only the females.\nOn the other hand, Gnolls wore minimal attire, usually just enough to cover their furry parts, which weren’t visible in the first place. And while Erin was fine with that look, she wasn’t too keen on wearing just a thong and breast band in public. Hence, her clothes.\nThe fabric was a rougher, sturdier type of cloth than Erin would have liked, but it wasn’t that uncomfortable. She’d slept in it fine just the other day. So why was it suddenly rubbing against her down…there…?\nErin looked down and began praying under her breath. She closed her eyes. Did she have to go to the bathroom? No. Nope. Not at all. So then why was she leaking…?\n“Oh. My. God. This is\nnot\nokay!”\nThe wetness in the crotch of her pants spread even as Erin looked down. She began to swear even as she jumped up and ran for some clean clothes. It couldn’t be happening. But it was. How had she forgotten?\nHer period. She was on her damn\nperiod\n.\nThe entire moment came as a huge shock to Erin. Not her monthlies. Rather—that she had missed the signs. She didn’t have the most dramatic signals, but Erin could normally count down the days in her head even if she didn’t keep exact track, and she could tell when her body was about to argue with her.\n…Normally. But Erin had missed any normal signs in the stress and trauma of fighting for her life. Which meant she was also completely flat-footed because—she had to be honest—\nThis was not a problem she equated with living in a world of magic and monsters.\nOf all the things to deal with—!\nErin went to the shopping bag where she’d neatly stored many of the items she’d bought and began tearing through it, tossing items aside. Towels. She had to have towels somewhere in here.\nThere. Erin grabbed them and a fresh pair of pants. She walked back into the common room and hesitated. Like hell she was going to change in here or in the kitchen. She went upstairs.\nAs Erin switched her pants and wiped away the mess, she wondered what cruel twist of fate had dumped her in this fantasy world—yet still gave her the miracle of life every month.\n“I’ve never heard of video game characters dealing with this! How do you expect Lara Croft to climb mountains with a giant frickin’ diaper in her pants? I’d love to see Leia fighting stormtroopers on her cycle!”\nErin slammed downstairs and threw her pants and the bloody towel on the ground. The other one she took to the kitchen and cut in half. Then she shoved it down her pants.\n“Rough.”\nThe towels were\nnot\nmeant for use in the way she was using them. Erin shuddered. This was a nightmare. She had to get relief. And by relief, she meant tampons.\nAnd that was another chilling thought, because Erin was pretty sure tampons never existed in medieval times. But—they had pads, right? Women existed back in the Dark Ages, even if they were oppressed. And Liscor wasn’t\nthat\nprimitive. So they had to have pads. They had to.\n“Please, God, if you’re there. Or the Buddha. I’ll pray to anyone. Just please don’t make me wear a diaper.”\nShe wasn’t even sure if they had diapers. She hadn’t seen many baby Drakes while walking in the city, and they stayed away from the scary Human in any case.\nErin went for the door and hesitated. She felt like she was wearing a scratchy diaper, but it couldn’t be helped. She felt at her pocket and then went to her discarded pants and pulled out a very thin coin pouch. She didn’t have much money, but it was probably enough.\nHer bloody pants and towel were another issue. Erin stared at them and then kicked them under the table. Then she opened the door and\nslammed\nit behind her. Her temper was already bad when she left her inn.\nAfter the forty minutes it took to get to Liscor at a quick pace, Erin’s mood had gone from bad to thunderous. The towel in her pants\nchafed\n. And her period was heavy. She wanted to kill everything. And that was before she tripped on a rock.",

This was a bad one.\n“Not now, Olesm.”\nHe ducked his head, but kept pace with her.\n“I understand this might be a bad moment, but I was wondering if you would be free later to play a game of—”\nErin turned her head as she stomped past him. Olesm swallowed the words he’d been about to say. She left him behind and kept moving down the street. Some Gnolls snarled at her when she walked in front of them. This time, she snarled back.",

    "text": "“Pads.”\nKrshia Silverfang looked up from her pile of copper and silver coins. She sniffed the air, frowned, and glanced up. Just like before, she was operating her stall in a new part of Market Street.\nErin had caught her setting up in the morning; the Gnoll woman was carefully laying out gemstone brooches made of silver on some fine cloth, like a jeweler. She smiled, but Erin was in no mood for pleasantries.\n“Yes, Erin Solstice?”\nErin took a deep breath. She couldn’t get mad. Not now, when her goal was so close.\n“Pads. I want to buy pads. Or tampons, if you guys actually have those.”\nThe Gnoll shopkeeper was sitting down, but her head was almost higher than Erin’s. She blinked at Erin.\n“What are these pads you speak of? Are they bandages?”\nShe sniffed the air again, and Erin’s blood froze. She felt the earth beneath her begin to open and a choir of undead hands reach up to pull her into the fiery pits of hell.\n“Please tell me you’re joking.”\nBits of fur flew into the air as Krshia shook her head.\n“Apologies. It is shedding season. Why are you so concerned, Erin Solstice? And—have you cut yourself? Hrr. It’s not the same as a wound, though? Strange.”\nA third time she sniffed, and Erin realized—she was\nsmelling—\nthe young woman turned crimson. Erin leaned forwards and whispered loudly to Krshia.\n“I’m\nbleeding.\nI need pads. Cloth pads,\nnow.\n”\n“Bleeding? Where?”\nMaybe the Gnoll really was messing with her, or she didn’t have the same sense of public decency Erin did. Either way, Erin leaned forwards and whispered the location and issue in Krshia’s ear.\nThe Gnoll shrugged.\n“Is it not fine?”\nErin gaped at her. Krshia scratched the fur around her neck, looking unconcerned.\n“It is only liquid, yes? And all who smell you will know either way. Why waste good cloth?”\nErin stared at her. Krshia stopped scratching.\n“What?”\n“Are you messing with me? Because if you are, I’m not in the mood for it.”\n“I would not tease a young one like you when you stink of sweat and blood.”\nKrshia looked mildly offended. Erin rubbed at her eyes and crossed her legs.\n“Sorry. It’s just—you can smell that?\nSeriously?\nNo, don’t tell me. I really don’t want to know. Don’t Gnolls have periods too?”\nThe Gnoll in question tilted her head slightly and made a confused face.\n“Periods?”\n“The menstrual cycle. You know, that time of the month when you donate blood. When Aunt Flo comes to town. Shark week. The Crimson Tide. Parting the Red Sea!”\nKrshia blinked at her. Erin felt her voice growing louder.\n“You know! Riding the cotton pony! It’s that thing ladies have! The waterfalls of hell! The blood baptism! The get-out-of-swim-class card! The proof of womanhood! The\npart of the month where blood comes out of your—\n”",

    "text": "Erin squatted on the ground, head buried in her arms. The other shoppers stared at her. The other shopkeepers stared at her. Half of them looked sympathetic. The other half looked disgusted. The children were torn between impressed and horrified.\nShe had screamed a very vivid description out loud to a crowded street. Mostly because neither Krshia nor the Drakes nor anyone else had seemed to\nget\nthe most basic part of biology for a young woman. For the guys, that was to be expected, but Drakes and Gnolls?\nA heavy, furry hand patted Erin on the shoulder. Erin looked up as Krshia stepped around her counter and smiled gently down at her. The Gnoll woman\nhmmed\nand chose her words carefully.\n“Humans have very strange bodies, yes?”\n“…Yes.”\nErin really hadn’t meant to shout.\n“I really didn’t mean to shout.”\n“It is nothing.”\nKrshia flicked her fingers dismissively. She glanced at the other people on Market Street. Erin looked up and saw Lism gagging at his stall. Krshia gave him a dismissive glance.\n“Shouting is good. Almost as good as howling, but we are forbidden to do that unless it is a full moon. But I am sorry. Gnolls do not have your periods, nor do we let our blood each month.”\n“So you don’t have anything like that?”\nThe Gnoll paused. She tapped her lips with one finger and nodded.\n“The blood. It is for mating, yes? We do have a similar time. All those who still are able to bear children, we go into a heat. It is called estrus, but it happens only once or twice a year. It is the time when we mate.”\nErin looked up at her.\n“Does it hurt?”\nKrshia scratched one ear and shook her head. More fur flew into the air.\n“It is enjoyable. Some look forwards to it. It is a time to have sex and to bear children, and so we are happy when it comes to us. There are issues—monthly bleeding is not one of them.”\nErin pointed a shaking finger at Krshia.\n“I hate you so much right now I can’t even explain.”\nThe Gnoll grinned at her, but without any malice.\n“I am sorry for your plight. But I have no smooth cloths. But I do have these. These are wool; not finely woven, but strong. Would you like a few?”\nErin looked at the rough fabric offered to her and shuddered.\n“Do you have any idea—\nno.\nJust please,\nplease\ntell me there’s someone who sells what I need in the city.”\nAgain, Krshia scratched her head. Erin wondered if she had fleas.\n“Hm. No.”\n“\nNo?\n”\n“We Gnolls need no padding. And the Drake folk and Antinium, they need none either. Humans are rare here, so I would not think any padding you wish for exists in any store.”\nThe blood drained from Erin’s face. She stared open-mouthed at the shopkeeper, who looked concerned at her expression.\n“Is it so bad?”\n“I—I’m going to die.”\n“Not from so little blood, I think. But I have a thought.”\nErin latched onto the ray of hope instantly.\n“Yes? Tell me. What’s your thought?”\n“The Adventurer’s Guild. They have bandages. Many bandages. If you cannot stop this blood, they would be able to help more than I. And bandages are soft, yes?”\n“Yes—yes they are.”\nErin was on her feet in an instant. She waddled away from the Gnoll and then stopped.\n“Thanks. I, uh, gotta go. See you later.”\nBemused, the Gnoll watched Erin waddle awkwardly out of sight. She looked at a female Drake who was passing by her shop. She bared her teeth in a grin.\n“Humans, eh?”",

    "text": "The cool wood counter of the reception desk in the Adventurer’s Guild felt good on Erin’s head. She rested her head there and wished she didn’t have to deal with the world.\n“So you really have blood coming from down there? And it happens every month?”\n“Yes.”\n“That’s so weird.”\nErin groaned. She looked up at Selys, the helpful receptionist. She’d been grateful to find the female Drake was working today, but she really,\nreally\ncouldn’t deal with her innocent curiosity.\n“I know. Everyone keeps telling me that. But please, do you have bandages? Thin,\nsoft\nfabric?”\nSelys nodded and pulled a drawer out. She fished out a roll of thin, white fabric and showed it to Erin.\n“We’ve got lots, just in case there’s an emergency. How much do you need?”\n“Lots.”\nErin said it glumly as she fished out her meager ration of coins. She tried to calculate how many rolls of bandages she’d need and how she’d turn them into a pad. She needed to buy food—but this was more important.\n“I’m going to need enough for a week, maybe. And I need to use the bandages to make a pad. You know, to cover the area. And I change pads every few hours sometimes, so…”\nDrakes didn’t have eyebrows, so Selys couldn’t raise them. But she widened her eyes and flicked her long tongue out.\n“That’s expensive. And gross. Sorry, Erin, but I’m not sure you’ll have enough money for that. Bandages are cheap, but you’ll be using a lot if what you say is true. Again. Gross.”\n“Tell me about it. On bad days back home, I used to use a ton of pads each day before I switched to tampons. And let me tell you,\nthat\nwas a psychological shift as well.”\nSelys looked blank. Erin waved her hand. She wasn’t about to open that can of worms.\n“Well, back on the topic of pads…why not make a few that you can re-use more than once?”\nErin looked up at Selys.\n“What?”\n“Well, doesn’t that make sense? If you’re going to make these pads dirty, why not rewash them rather than keep throwing them away like the ones you talk about.”\nAs she opened her mouth to reply, Erin’s brain froze. She tried to think of a response but she didn’t have any good one.\n“Um. Uh, that’s—that’s actually a good idea. I heard they did that in developing countries but—okay. Okay, yeah. It’s gross, but yeah. How would I get one of those made?”\nSelys smiled at Erin. There were still too many pointy teeth in the smile, but Erin was getting used to it.\n“I’ve stitched up more than a few adventurers right here. I can make a few of these pads quite quickly if you want me to. I’ve got the Skill [Fast Stitching], so it won’t take more than a few minutes.”\nErin leaned across the counter and seized Selys by the clawed hand. The receptionist blinked at her in surprise.\n“Oh, thank you, thank you,\nthank you\n.”\n“It’s nothing. Really. I’ll start on this pad right away. How should it look?”\n“Um. Sort of like this.”\nErin showed Selys as the other Drake\nhmmed\nand began layering the cloth bandage together. They’d just finished the basic design and Erin had opened her coin pouch when she heard a familiar\ngrowl\nfrom behind her.\nSelys gulped, but Erin scowled. She turned around and looked up into the face of an irritated male Gnoll.\n“Human. You still stink.”\n“I’m not talking to you. Go away.”\nHe blinked at her, but Erin was already turning back to Selys. She felt a rough hand spin her around, and she nearly dropped her money. She narrowed her eyes up at the Gnoll.\n“You stink of blood. I warned you last time—leave this place now.”\nErin felt her teeth grinding together. She clenched her jaw and looked up at the Gnoll. He was big and scary, but she was also pretty sure he wasn’t allowed to hit her. And even if he were, she was in a really bad mood. Unbidden, the thought occurred to her that she’d never figured out what [Bar Fighting] actually did.\n“Do I\nlook\nlike I’m in the mood to be bullied?”\nThe male Gnoll\ngrowled\nat her. Erin stared at him. She didn’t blink. She was really cramping up down below now, and the trickling sensation was\nnot\nmaking anything better.\nHer gaze locked with the Gnoll’s for a solid minute. He was looming over her, doing the classic male intimidation move. She was too angry and sore to care.\nAfter another minute, the Gnoll’s ears suddenly flattened for a second. He whirled and walked away. Erin flipped him off with one hand and then turned back to Selys.\n“Sorry. Where were we?”\nThe female Drake was staring at Erin with an open mouth. Erin stared back at her and then flashed a smile.\n“Bully me once, shame on you. Bully me twice—I get mean. And violent.”\n“I can see that. But I would have known it anyways. Terbore might growl at you, but we all heard about how you killed that Goblin Chieftain by yourself. That was some story.”\nErin’s smile slipped for a fraction of a second.\n“Oh. Someone told you about that?”\n“Oh yes.”\nSelys nodded as she began stitching the bandages together with needle and thread. The claws that held the long needle flashed back and forth across the fabric at mesmerizing speed.\n“Klbkch had to turn in the Goblin Chieftain’s head here. We all heard about how you killed it. That’s amazing, by the way—Klb says you don’t even have any levels in a fighting class. How’d you do it?”\n“Um. I burned his face off.”\n“Oh, are you a [Mage] then? I saw a Human one in town the other day, but apparently he’s a troublemaker and a thief.”\n“No, no. I’m no mage. It’s just—I used a trick. And I nearly died. I bet Klbkch didn’t mention that.”\n“He said you were wounded. Was it bad?”\n“Very. He gave me a healing potion. Without that, I would have been a goner.”\nHer hands paused in stitching as Selys stared at Erin.\n“He gave you his Senior Guardsman’s healing potion? But that’s\nexpensive\n. You must have been badly injured if Klbkch gave you his potion.”\nErin shifted nervously.\n“Are they—are they expensive? Those potions, I mean.”\n“Very. At least, the ones I know the Watch issues to Senior Guardsmen.”\nSelys nodded. She named the price, and it was Erin’s turn to gape.\n“Well, it’s important that the Watch carries them in case someone gets hurt. They’re not supposed to use them unless someone’s really hurt, though. Like…citizens. And the potions the Senior Guardsmen carry are even stronger. They can heal most big injuries in a moment. Unless you lose an arm or a body part, you’ll be fine in moments.”\n“Yeah. They are good.”\nErin poked at her stomach reflexively. She sighed. Another mark on her debt to Klbkch.\n“I’m just glad it was only a Goblin Chieftain. If the rest of the Goblins had come after me, I would have been dead.”\n“Oh, if it had been a Goblin raiding party, we’d have sent out the entire Watch to deal with them. I just don’t understand why a Chieftain would come after you. It doesn’t make sense.”\nErin blinked.\n“A Goblin what now?”\n“A Goblin raid. Haven’t you heard of them?”\n“Uh. No…no I have not. We don’t have many Goblins where I come from.”\nSelys sighed enviously as she finished the first pad and slid it over to Erin. The other girl felt at the soft fabric and smiled happily. Selys leaned over the counter, looking serious.\n“You’re lucky. Goblins are a real problem around here. I mean, sure, the lone Goblin isn’t that dangerous. But they’re one of the few monster species that can level. That’s why we send out Senior Guardsmen and post bounties on Goblins to keep their numbers down. Before we get a Goblin Chieftain with high levels. Or a Goblin\nLord.\n”\nGoblins could…level up? Right, she’d been told that. Erin blinked at Selys. And what was that about a Goblin Lord? But the entire idea nagged at her, so she lingered.\n“So you guys kill Goblins all the time? What about Chieftains? Do you send adventurers after those guys?”\nErin didn’t know how she felt about that. Bad. But her sympathy only extended to the small Goblins, not the vicious, sadistic, big ones.\n“Chieftains? Yes, but we have to be careful. Most Bronze-rank teams can’t survive an encounter with a strong one. Silver-ranks have to take on tribes—and there are some that even Gold-rank teams can’t handle.”\nSelys shuddered. Erin frowned. As far as she could tell, Relc never seemed to worry about any number of Goblins.\n“Why not?”\n“It’s not that they’re stronger than the Watch. Relc, Klbkch, even some of the regular Watch are probably better fighters than Chieftains on a technical level. It’s just that they’re Hobgoblins—tough. And strong. And when they call their tribe, well, the average group of adventurers would get wiped out against that mob.”\n“So you’re not sending adventurers out against a raiding party either, then?”\n“Dead gods, no. If we hear about one of those, we form a hunting party and try to get rid of it right away. A raiding party can wipe out a village in an hour if we don’t get to it in time.”\n“Nasty.”\n“It is. Here’s another pad.”\n“Thanks. Sorry I can’t pay you more—it’s just that I don’t have much money from this innkeeping thing.”\nSelys waved her needle at Erin.\n“Don’t apologize. I’m happy to help. But I’m afraid I could have warned you that innkeeping in that old inn isn’t a good idea.”\n“Why not?”\n“Well, what level are you? Ten? Twenty?”\n“Nine.”\n“See, that’s not too good. If you were in the city, I’d say you should get apprenticed to another [Innkeeper]until you’re at least Level 15. It might take a year or two, but then you’d have a few good skills to run your inn with. And I wouldn’t have an inn that far away from the city to begin with.”\n“Yeah. No one comes by. Is it because I’m Human? Or is it too far to walk?”\nAnother pad finished, Selys picked up the roll of bandages and cut off more for the last pad. She lined the backing with a stiffer cloth and then sewed layers of the soft bandage on top.\n“Both, I’d say. It’s dangerous to come out that far—well, not too dangerous, but it’s a bit of a deterrent. Your being Human isn’t bad, but…”\n“But…?”\n“Well, I’ve heard Relc talking in bars. He says you make pasta. Is…is that all you sell?”\nErin squirmed in place. Her mother had offered to teach her how to cook more, but…Erin had often excused herself from dinner help, or washing the dishes, on the pretext of chess games. It was coming back to bite her now.\n“Um. Yeah. I can make other things. I’ve got [Basic Cooking], but—what’s wrong?”\nSelys was shaking her head as she sewed. Erin was envious of her speed and also her scaled hands. Whenever the Drake missed her cloth or stabbed one of her fingers, the needle hit her scales rather than soft, vulnerable flesh.\n“I don’t want to be rude, Erin, but that’s not too impressive. All cooks and chefs have [Basic Cooking] as a skill. Some even have [Advanced Cooking].”\n“Oh. And, uh, I guess pasta isn’t that interesting.”\nSelys kindly didn’t respond to that statement.\n“You could make other things, but there are a lot of good inns in the city. And we get recipes from the Human cities up north all the time. Even if you sold a new dish, someone would copy it the next night.”\nErin’s face fell. Selys looked unhappy, but went on.\n“Anyways, no one will make the journey if all you’re selling is pasta. I’m sorry.”\nErin groaned as she thumped her head back against the counter. That helped explain her lack of business. And it was sadly obvious. Erin just—hadn’t ever run a restaurant or inn before!\nHer regular clients might not mind eating the same dishes, but everyone else would. She guessed she should be grateful for her regulars, thinking of it that way.\nRelc would probably eat anything he could swallow, Pisces would eat anything he could steal, and Klbkch would eat anything she put in front of him. The\nGoblins\nwere probably pickier eaters than her clientele.\nThe last pad done, Selys slid it over to Erin. The young woman gratefully accepted them and felt them carefully. They were thick, but not so much that they’d be uncomfortable wearing. More importantly, they were made of strong materials, and she was sure she’d be able to wash and use them again.\n“You have no idea how much this means to me. Thank you so much.”\nThe Drake smiled at her. Erin smiled back.\n“Don’t mention it. And good luck with your innkeeping. I’m sorry I had to say it like that, but—”\n“No, you’re right. I’ll…do some thinking about it. But right now—”\nErin was edging away from the counter.\n“Uh, where’s your bathroom?”",

    "text": "A shifting, glowing mass of green and black insects covered the bottom half of a table and pieces of bloody cloth. Erin looked at the countless bugs that had entered her inn and wondered whether screaming would attract their attention. Probably.\nThey were huge, black bugs that vaguely resembled fireflies. Except these Acid Flies were up to three times bigger than fireflies, and instead of pretty glowing backsides, theirs were bulbous glowing orbs that exploded if you annoyed them. They were ungainly; they had a vaguely fly-like torso and front, but their backside was a huge, glowing bulb filled with the green acid that gave off a lurid, practically neon glow.\nAnd they were in Erin’s inn. And there were dozens, crawling all over her bloody clothes.\nAnd they were in her inn.\n“Oh no.\nNo.\nThis is not right.”\nSlowly, she edged around the room. The Acid Flies took no notice of her. Erin made it to the kitchen, dropped her pads in a clean spot, and grabbed a bucket. Then she edged back out of the room and ran for the stream.",

    "text": "Ten minutes later, Erin opened the door of the inn and ducked as an Acid Fly buzzed at her face. The insect spiraled away and flew back to the bloody clothes. Erin narrowed her eyes and squinted.\nIt looked like the flies had devoured, or melted, a large part of the cloth. And either they were full or sleeping, because most of them were sitting on the pants or around it, not moving.\n“Perfect.”\nErin tiptoed closer, pausing every few seconds to make sure she wasn’t bothering the bugs. The bucket was heavy in her hands, but she was close. She just needed to be in range.\nWhen she was certain she was close enough, Erin took a deep breath and then hurled the bucket at the flies. The bugs were washed away by a tide of water and struggled helplessly on their backs, their wings too heavy to fly.\nErin moved fast. In an instant, she was in the kitchen and pulling out a large glass jar she’d used for storing perishable foods. She dumped a bunch of onions out and then grabbed a long-handled spatula.\nThe flies were still struggling to get up as Erin moved back into the common room. She bent down and began flicking them into the glass jar, one after another. Some exploded as the wooden spatula touched them, but soon, Erin had figured out the way to avoid the Acid Flies bursting was to hit their heads, rather than their glowing, green abdomens.\nIn no time at all, she’d rounded up all the Acid Flies and sealed them in the large glass jar. Then she was rushing back to mop the acidic water and the exploded flies in a disgusting mess out the front door of her inn. Thankfully, the water diluted the acid—it was just disgusting. That done, she sat back in a chair and wondered whether she was cursed.\n“So. Apparently Acid Flies like blood. Right. And does that mean I have to worry about them landing on me when I sleep?”\nShe looked down at the jar of flies. Most of them were buzzing around inside the glass jar by now. They clung to the glass, fanning their wings innocently.\nErin lifted the jar up carefully and stared in horrified fascination at the bugs.\n“Four legs. I\nknew\nI wasn’t dreaming that up.”\nThat would technically make the flies not flies, but it didn’t matter either way. They looked like oversized houseflies, acted like them, and aside from the exploding acid bit, they were as harmless as flies.\n“And now I have a jar full of these deadly little critters. What do I do now?”\nErin stared at the jar. Letting them go was probably a stupid idea. Mainly because they liked blood. And she was on her period. Ergo, they’d probably land on her and melt her face off. So what could she do?\n“…Hm.”\nErin hesitated and then experimentally shook the jar. Instantly, half of the Acid Flies inside exploded. The green, glowing liquid flowed to the bottom of the glass jar while the bodies of the dead flies floated to the top.\nAfter checking to make sure the top of the jar was extremely secure, Erin gave it a really hard shake. This time, the rest of the Acid Flies exploded, and she was left with a pool of green acid and a bunch of dead fly corpses bobbing on the surface. The glass and their bodies were the only completely acid-proof things that Erin had found. The cork would slowly dissolve if she turned the jar over—but slower than almost anything else, and it worked well enough as long as the jar was stored upright.\n“I should feel bad about that. I really should.”\nShe didn’t. And as Erin stared at the dead flies floating in the acid, she had a thought. She carefully put the glass jar in a corner of the room where she wouldn’t trip over it by accident and got another one out from the kitchen.\n“One jar for bugs, one jar for deadly acid. Perfect.”\nErin picked up the jars and hesitated again.\n“Acid. Does it melt glass? It doesn’t\nlook\nlike it’s melting, but will I wake up with a hole in my floor?”\nShe thought acid did. At least, the Aliens from the movie could melt through glass. But that was a movie. On the other hand, this was a fantasy world.\n“Right. But in chemistry class, we used glass.”\nBut again, this was another world. Erin carefully held up the glass bottle and peered at the edges. No steam or atrophy so far. Even so, she put the jar in a far corner of the kitchen. Just in case. Then she inserted a metal ladle into the acid, saw that it didn’t dissolve either, and transferred the dead fly-bodies to a separate jar.\n“Okay. Done. Now what?”\nIt took her two seconds to realize what she’d forgotten. Erin smacked her forehead.\n“Time for cleanup.”\nShe got up wearily and trudged back into the common room. She looked down at the part of the floor and table where the Acid Flies had been congregating and swore when she saw the holes and gaps in the wood.",

    "text": "It wasn’t easy dragging a table out of the inn, but it helped when the wood broke apart and she could drag the pieces out. The acid had eaten through the base of the table and pitted the floorboards. That meant Erin was also faced with the lovely prospect of repairing the floor after she was done with the table.\nWell, Klbkch had helped her repair the floorboards after the Chieftain attacked, so she knew what to do. Plus, he’d left the tools behind, including a kind of wood-glue and nails. A bit of figuring out how to pry the floorboards loose with a hammer and Erin’s [Basic Crafting] Skill did the rest. It took her an hour, but when she was done, the only sign the flies had been there were a few differently colored floorboards and her aching back.\n“I hate all bugs. Except for Klbkch. No, actually, I hate him too. At least flies don’t lie to my face.”\nErin collapsed back into a chair and stared at the ceiling. Today was not a good day. In fact, she’d put it in the top ten bad days she’d ever had. Unfortunately, that meant it was a\ngood\nday if you compared it to the ones she’d been having since she got here.\n“Who knew I’d be grateful to be covered in sawdust and sweat rather than blood?”\nShe laughed, coughed as some dust got into her lungs, and stood up.\n“Bath time.”",

    "text": "One of the glorious things Erin had been introduced to in Liscor was the public bathhouses. They weren’t free to enter, of course. She had to pay five coppers, but they were hot and luxurious and well worth the price. Come to that, she got off easy since she paid the same rate as Drakes. Gnolls and other Beastkin had to pay twice as much because of the fur.\nYes, the steaming bathhouses were a delight to match any convenience of the modern world. Just sinking into the scented waters was enough to take Erin away from the pain of reality.\nThat was why bathing in the freezing waters of the stream was twice as hard now. Erin stuck her foot in the water, yelped, and then decided to jump in before she lost her nerve.",

After Erin had gone through the shock of getting in the cold water, she scrubbed herself as fast as possible, lathered herself with the ball of soap she’d bought from Krshia, and screamed again when she saw the fish in the water.\nIt shot through the water like a torpedo. Erin exploded out of the stream like a rocket. It followed her but couldn’t figure out how to run after her on dry ground. Erin ran around screaming, hit the fish with the bucket she’d brought until it stopped moving, and ran away. She came back only later when she’d had a brilliant idea.",

    "text": "Erin trudged back across the grasslands, an empty glass jar tucked under one hand and a knife and bucket in the other. She held the knife so it pointed down. She wasn’t sure if that rule only applied to scissors, but she figured it couldn’t hurt with knives.\nIt was later. In truth, it felt like days had passed, but somehow she was still on the same day. The sun was starting to set in the sky, though, so at least she was halfway done.\nFrom this distance, she could see a green glow coming from the dead fish. Erin slowed down and put down her burden and shaded her eyes. It looked like her targets were already waiting for her.\n“Hm.”\nErin squinted. All the flies were resting on the fish. Or in it. That was good.\nSlowly, very slowly, she tiptoed towards the fish, the bucket in her hands. She eyed the Acid Flies and saw they were rubbing themselves all over the fish. The acid from their backsides was eating into the fish, and they in turn were eating the melted result.\n“Oh wow. That’s gross.”\nThe flat fish wasn’t so much flat as runny now. Erin wondered if she should feel sick, but she mainly felt a kind of fascinated revulsion. She shook her head and got back to her mission before the flies decided they wanted dessert with dinner.\nStealthily, Erin filled the bucket from the stream. Then she tiptoed over to the fish and tossed the water all over the flies and the fish.\nAgain, the Acid Flies found themselves struggling on their backs, unable to fly. Erin dashed back and grabbed the glass jar.\n“Take this! And that!”\nErin began smushing the downed Acid Flies with her glass jar. They exploded in showers of acid, and in no time, she’d killed them all. That done, Erin looked at the dead fish.\nIt was mostly melted from the acid. Erin prodded it with her knife and gagged. But she needed it, so she steeled herself and tried to cut the fish in two.\nThe knife blade sunk through the fish like butter. It wasn’t so much fish now as sludge. And no matter how hard Erin tried, she couldn’t get it to separate. Wherever she cut, the sludge oozed back together.\nDisgusted in more than one sense, Erin covered her face with one hand.\n“Well, of course that would happen.”\nShe needed a spoon, not a knife. Lacking one, she used the knife to scoop some of the fish sludge away. She stared at it and felt her stomach roiling. As the smell of the decayed fish hit her nose, she dry-heaved.\n“I can do this. Think of the money. Think of the food. Think of the inn.\nDon’t\nthink of the fish.”\nShe took several deep breaths while looking the other way. When she was fairly sure she wasn’t about to throw up, she went back to the sludge.\n“Okay, [Basic Crafting], activate!”\nFirst, Erin took some of the green fish-sludge and poured it in the bottom of her glass jar. Then, she took off the glass top and set it on top of the jar so that it was just wide enough to let flies squeeze into the container, but didn’t give them much room to get out. Then she walked away.\n“Acid Fly trap, complete!”\nErin stared at the glass jar. She slapped herself gently with one hand. Then she set up three more jars the same way.\n“Let’s see how you like this, you little jerks.”",

    "text": "“You have a talent for finding the most dangerous things, don’t you?”\nPisces shuddered as he gazed at the Acid Fly traps. He edged away from them and rubbed his arms nervously. Erin grinned at him.\n“Aren’t they gross? But look—the jars are almost half full, and it’s not even been more than two hours.”\n“How fascinating.”\nHe took another step back. Erin eyed him, but she couldn’t judge him too harshly. Both she and the mage were a good ten feet away from the glass jars.\nErin had to own it—she wasn’t good at making traps. The entire conceit of her jar trap was that the lid was\njust\nplaced such that a fly would have trouble getting out because insects were stupid. However, if she were trying to trap houseflies, most would invariably leave the trap once the food ran out.\n…In this case, the Acid Flies were just stupid and didn’t want to leave. They swarmed over the fish-melt without a care in the world, and it was easy to just tip-toe over and close the lid. Thus, you had a jar full of…acidic flies. Pisces could admire the traps—he just didn’t see\nwhy\nyou wanted a jar. Of Acid Flies.\nPisces licked his lips as he stared at the jars. The way the countless glowing shapes moved and heaved against the glass was hypnotic. It also put him off his lunch. He turned to Erin and smiled wanly.\n“I imagine…I imagine if all four containers were to rupture, the swarm of these insects could very well engulf us and melt our flesh within moments.”\nErin thought about this and gave Pisces a scowl.\n“What a lovely image.”\n“Yes. Yes, I imagine it will fill my dreams tonight.”\nShe shook her head.\n“They can’t get out of the jars. They’re not that smart. They wriggle in, but the lid keeps them from exiting. I did the same thing with fruit flies back where I lived. Well, I lined the edges with sticky tape, but this seems to work because these guys are even dumber than fruit flies.”\n“I applaud your ingenuity. But may I ask\nwhy\nyou decided to capture a swarm of deadly insects that prey on dead matter?”\n“Well, they’re bugs. I bet Klbkch would love to eat them.”\nPisces gave her a fish-eye look. He shook his head.\n“It’s your funeral if you want to attempt to cook them. May I advise removing the acid before you serve them to your guests?”\nErin glowered at Pisces. She wasn’t even sure why she’d invited the mage to see her traps. She just wanted to show off, and he was the only one who’d come for dinner that night.\n“I don’t get how they can survive anyways, if they explode so much. I mean, how would they even live long enough to reproduce?”\n“By having few predators insane enough to risk consuming them. That, and the fact that they are nearly limitless in number.”\n“Ah.”\nPisces waved a hand at the glass jars.\n“These are only the males of the species, in any case. The females are—substantially—larger. In fact, the sole purpose of the male is to gather as much food as possible. He will dissolve and absorb as much nutrition into his lower abdomen before returning to a female in hopes of winning her favor. They all do it.”\n“Oh, sort of like how bees and ants both have queens, right? All the workers feeding the big leader?”\nErin glanced over and saw Pisces gaping at her open-mouthed.\n“What?”\nHe shook his head.\n“I was unaware you were so familiar with the biology of insects, that’s all.”\n“Oh, I know tons of weird animal facts. When I was a kid, I watched Discovery Chann—I mean, I read lots of books.”\n“You can read?”\nPisces gave her a look almost bordering on respect. Erin glowered at him.\n“Of course I can read. I can also play chess, and I read poetry. Sometimes.”\n“You can play chess?”\nErin glared again, but he seemed genuinely curious.\n“Oh yeah. I play chess. A tiny bit. You could say it’s a hobby of mine.”\nIt was sad to see the sly look that crept into his gaze before he turned his head, coughed, and came back with a carefully bland expression. Pisces’ lips twitched as he gestured to the inn over-casually.\n“Really? As it happens, I was considered one of the better players in the northern cities. Would you care for a game? Perhaps with a wager or two on the side?”\nPisces smiled innocuously at her. Erin rolled her eyes.",

    "text": "An hour later, Pisces stared at the chess pieces in front of him with desperate concentration. He moved the king piece in front of him left and then right. He turned his head to look at the board another way.\n“Perhaps if I—”\n“Nope. And even if you try to take the pawn, it’s still checkmate.”\nErin didn’t bother looking up from her meal. She’d made scrambled eggs with sausage on the side. It wasn’t the most exciting of meals to eat, but it was tasty, filling, and better than having to stare at Pisces.\nHe sat back, put his fingers in his hair, and stared at the board with a look of wild disbelief. He glanced up at Erin, looked at the board, and then gave up and sat back. Pisces stared at the beams in the ceiling overhead, as if uncertain whether this was reality or a fever dream.\n“I cannot fathom it. I was—am one of the best players on the continent! I have outplayed [Tacticians] and other mages of similar caliber and skill. How could you defeat me?”\nShe shrugged.\n“Amateurs are still amateurs. By the way, I’ll put the money you bet me on your tab.”\nPisces’ eyes widened. He had made several bets before he realized who he was up against. Erin hadn’t saved him from himself. He lurched upright, a finger desperately raised.\n“Ah. That. Clearly, I made a miscalculation. Would you care to waive my debts if I—”\n“No. You bet, and I won. No arguing. Eat your eggs.”\nErin heard a loud\nsniff\n, but after a moment, she also heard the\nclink\nof metal on pottery.\n“I must admit, this is better fare than your unfortunate soup of yesterday.”\nShe looked up. Pisces quickly looked down at his plate.\nAfter she’d glared for a bit, Erin asked a question that had been on her mind for a while.\n“What do you do all day, anyways?”\nPisces looked up and swallowed the scrambled eggs.\n“I study the mystical realms of the transmundane. To unlock the secrets of the ether and command over supernatural forces, I—”\n“You study.”\n“Pretty much.”\nPisces shrugged and went back to munching on his dinner.\n“Do you need to study that much? I mean, don’t you know spells?”\nHe sighed.\n“For all my magical proficiency, I cannot cast more than a few magics beyond the fourth tier in any field, and I am relegated to first and second-tier magics in most fields outside of my specialization.”\nErin sampled one of her pieces of bacon and nearly burnt her tongue.\n“Oh. Um. Magic has tiers?”\nPisces rolled his eyes.\n“Indeed. Seven or eight to be exact. There is a speculative ninth tier of magic, but no [Mage] has ever cast or discovered a spell of such magic that I have read of in any history book. Well, Tier 7 spells are a thing of myth in the modern era. In any case, to cast such spells, [Mages] such as I require concentration, time, and effort to unravel the workings of each new incantation.”\nAgain, Erin had to pause to figure out what Pisces was saying.\n“Right. So you study to cast better spells. And I guess that makes you level up as well?”\nHe began prodding his king-piece moodily, annoyed by her rephrasing all his statements.\n“Obviously. It is a taxing affair, especially given that menial affairs such as lodging and sustenance must be taken care of while one attempts to study.”\nErin propped her head on one elbow.\n“Almost makes you wish you had a job, huh?”\nPisces eyed her dourly.\n“Until recently, I had a quite profitable side business liberating unneeded supplies from the locals in exchange for entertainment. But now, I abstain from such activities to stay within your good graces.”\n“Yeah, and because Relc threatened to stab you if you kept doing it. That’s not really a good career path, you know.”\nHe sniffed loudly.\n“I also had a far more lucrative occupation liberating unneeded items from those who were in no position to use them, but apparently, that is considered a grave violation of privacy as well.”\n“You rob the\ndead\n?”\n“I reburied them afterwards.”\nErin opened her mouth, raised a finger, threw up her hands, and gave up. She stared at Pisces as the mage huffily finished his food.\n“Why don’t you do something actually useful instead?”\n“And what would I do that is so useful?”\n“I dunno. What do mages do for a living? Blow up stuff with fireballs? Dispense sage advice? Sell their beards? I found a bunch of magic runes in the kitchen. They kept food fresh for—I dunno, years.”\n“Ah. A [Preservation] spell, no doubt. Yes, that is certainly a service some [Mages] skilled in runecraft can provide for plebians.”\n“…And? Can you do that?”\n“I cannot.”\n“Darn.”\nPisces folded his fingers as he sat back, as haughty as a king on a throne. And somehow, a king in rags, waiting for his second helping of bacon.\n“I am sorry to betray your high expectations of me, but I fear even a mage of my caliber cannot study every school of the higher arts.”\nErin glanced up at Pisces. The mage was scraping his plate with the knife and fork. She had the distinct impression he would have licked it if she weren’t watching. He really was thin, and so, sighing, she added another egg to the mix as she ladled bacon dripping with grease onto the plate. Amazingly, he had gotten mad when she tried to drain the grease. So had Relc.\n“I never had high hopes for you in the first place. I just think it’s too bad, that’s all. You know magic, and you don’t do anything with it.”\nPisces put down his fork.\n“Some would say magic is its own reward. I would.”\n“I guess.”\nErin sighed. She felt like she was talking to a wall. A particularly annoying wall with bad hygiene.\n“You know, if you actually helped people and were a bit nicer, I think you’d actually be fun to hang around with. Why are you so rude to everyone?”\nShe hadn’t meant it to sting, but clearly it hit Pisces somewhere vulnerable. He sat up straight in his chair, his eyes flashing.\n“Thus far, I haven’t found any people worthy of my assistance. Why should I help those who judge me in ignorance and fear?”\nErin blinked up at him. The young mage’s face was pale with indignation, but spots of color flared in each cheek. She thought about asking him another question—but he was in no mood for conversation. His eyes flashed with a kind of actual anger. Not at her—but it was so real she was taken aback.\nShe could have dropped it. Instead, Erin just shrugged and stood up. She looked Pisces in the eyes and retorted calmly.\n“Because you’re a better person than they are.”\nHe blinked. His eyes were grey and green, not like moss on a rock, more like a dance between the two colors, a nebula of both and perhaps the faintest hint of orange in that distant solar phenomenon. Scornful, aloof normally—and right now, wide with surprise. They did not look like any [Necromancer]’s gaze that Erin would have imagined.\nShe collected his plate and hers and left the mage sitting at the table. When she came out of the kitchen, he was gone.",

    "text": "The next day, Erin got up and went to check on her fly traps. They’d worked scarily well.\nAll four glass jars were filled with crawling, wriggling shapes. Erin took one look at the jars, gagged a bit, and then had to go sit down.\n“Oh man. Oh wow. That’s the nastiest thing I’ve ever seen.”\nIt was also, on reflection, the scariest thing she’d ever seen. Erin wondered what would happen if she accidentally knocked the lid off of one of the jars. She recalled Pisces’ comment about melting flesh and shuddered.\nCarefully, Erin walked over to the jars. She repeatedly thought about how important it was\nnot\nto trip.\nHer foot caught on a tuft of grass. Erin windmilled her arms wildly and caught herself just before she tripped into one of the jars.\n“Not okay. Not okay.”\nBefore her heart could finish stopping, Erin adjusted the lids of each jar so they firmly covered the openings. Now, the Acid Flies couldn’t get out at all.\n“That’s better.”\nErin hefted one of the jars up and felt some of the Acid Flies explode within.\n“Oof. That’s\nheavy\n.”\nShe repositioned the jar as the acid and flies shifted inside. For such little insects, they weighed a\nton.\n“Gotta be all the acid in their backsides. Okay. This could take a while.”\nErin took one step and then another. She adjusted her grip around the glass jar so she wouldn’t drop it. She’d have to watch the ground for potholes, but she was pretty happy with her posture. She took another step and tripped over another of the glass fly traps.\nThe ground rushed to meet Erin’s face. She realized she was still holding the glass jar and hurled it away from her just in time. She smacked into the ground hard and exhaled hard. Aside from that, she was fine.\nThen Erin heard the glass jar\nshatter\nas it hit the ground. She rolled to her feet and stood up.\nThe large glass jar lay in shards on the grass. Green-gray acidic sludge dripped onto the ground, raising steam and\nhissing\nwhere it met the soil. For a moment, all was still among the wreckage. Then, with a horrific\nbuzzing,\na swarm of black shapes flew into the air.\nErin felt her heart stop. She looked up at the spiraling cloud of flies. They flew around wildly, looking for whatever had disturbed them. Erin backed away slowly, praying they would ignore her. For a moment, it seemed as if they would fly off, but then the entire direction of the swarm changed. The cloud of flies seemed to recoil and then encircled Erin in an instant.\nHer heart had stopped. It wasn’t beating in her chest. Erin looked around desperately, but all she saw were buzzing,\nbuzzing\nflies. They filled the sky, the ground,\neverything\n.\n“I—”\nThey swarmed her. Erin screamed and covered her eyes and mouth.\n“\n[Gust]!\n”\nErin heard the voice and then a raging gale blew around her. She staggered as the wind blew her around. The effect on the Acid Flies was even more pronounced. They were blasted away from Erin into a funnel of air that whirled them into one spot. They buzzed around angrily, disoriented and confused.\nSo was Erin. She looked around and saw a familiar young man wearing dirty grey robes. He was pointing a finger in her direction.\n“Duck, Erin!”\nErin dove to the ground and hit the dirt hard. She looked up and saw Pisces raise one hand. A pale frost formed at his fingertips, and half-visible gusts of wind blew around the length of his arm. He pointed at the disoriented swarm of Acid Flies.\n“[Frozen Wind].”\nA gentle breeze blew against the top of Erin’s head. Then, the air\ncrackled\nand her hair froze in place. Erin could see the faintest trace of whirling air as it blew over her head. Where it passed, snow began to fall from the sky, and she felt an intense freezing cold engulf her.\nThe swarm of Acid Flies flew into the freezing breeze and fell out of the sky. Erin yelped and ran as they showered down around her, frozen insects that burst as they hit the ground.\nShe dove into the river and leapt out of it just as quickly in case the flat fish tried to bite her. When she cleared the water out of her eyes, the glowing swarm was gone, and all that was left was a circle of smoking dirt and frozen grass.\nWhen Erin had finished shaking so hard she couldn’t move, she stood up. She was still trembling uncontrollably.\n“That was\nthe\nmost amazing thing I’ve ever seen. Thank you, thank you, thank you,\nthank you\n.”\nShe lurched over to Pisces. She wasn’t sure if she should throw her arms around him or start crying. She settled for a brief hug and then doubled down and hugged him fiercely. He didn’t seem to notice the fact that she was dripping with water.\nPisces was breathing hard. He stared at the sizzling patch of earth where the Acid Flies had been, as if mesmerized. She could see the whites of his eyes as they shifted towards her.\n“It—that was a beginner’s spell. Not suitable for most combat and downplayed by my instructors. However, it was the best tool for the moment. All magic is worth using, after all.”\n“Right.”\nErin nodded. Pisces nodded. His eyes flicked back to the patch of melted earth.\n“You saved me. It was incredible, that spell.”\nHe shook his head and waved a hand weakly in her direction.\n“I am—I am a [Mage] of Wistram Academy. As a talented practitioner of the wind elementalist field of magic along with other spells in a generalist’s repertoire, of course such displays are second—second—”\nPisces bent over and threw up in the grass. He retched and then threw up again. Erin patted him on the back and waited for him to stop.\nAfter a while, Pisces wiped his mouth with a corner of his robe. His face was still pale, but he looked better.\n“You were lucky I happened to be here. Very lucky.”\nErin nodded.\n“I was. I really was.”\nPisces nodded back. Erin felt like they were both bobbleheads, but there was nothing else to do. He pointed a trembling finger at the three glass jars still holding the swarms of Acid Flies.\n“If you insist on using such traps, might I suggest you anchor them in the stream?”\nErin looked blank.\n“The stream? Why?”\n“Several reasons.”\nPisces shakily counted them off on his fingers.\n“Firstly, the natural buoyancy of the water would prevent the breakage of glass if the jars were dropped, or at least mitigate the danger of the Acid Flies. Secondly, the effects of wind and other native life would also be mitigated. And thirdly, I would not be at risk of tripping over such traps.”\n“Right. I can do that.”\nShe wasn’t sure if it was shock, but the trembling in her body had nearly vanished. Erin grabbed a rock, tied some long grass to it, and anchored the rock to the glass jar. She dropped the rock in the stream and watched the jar bob and float in the water.\n“Hm. I need something heavy to make sure it stays upright. I guess sometimes the jars might turn over…but it’ll work. Better than leaving them on the ground. A hundred thousand times better.”\nPisces nodded again.\n“Well.”\n“Good thing you came along.”\nBoth nodded again. Pisces opened his mouth and grimaced. He went over to the stream and shakily rinsed his mouth out. Then he looked up at her.\n“May I ask—what is it you plan to do now, Erin?”\nShe looked at him. Then she looked at the glass jars full of flies.\n“I’m going to take these jars back to the inn. You’re coming with me in case I drop one. And then…”\n“And then?”\n“And then I’m going to feed you until you explode like one of the flies.”\nPisces glanced down at the glass jars and the milling Acid Flies within. He shuddered again.\n“An apt description.”",

    "text": "The jar of Acid Flies was a mix of acid and death. The corpses of hundreds—thousands of the small bugs floated in a sea of glowing green juice. It slopped against the side of the glass, an obscene testament to insectoid death.\n“Hold on, I think there’s one left.”\nErin shook the glass jar. The last remaining Acid Fly bounced against the glass and popped dully within.\n“What will you do with them?”\nShe looked up at Pisces. The mage was sitting several tables away from her, deliberately not looking at the glass jars.\n“I’ll separate the flies and the acid. I don’t know what I’ll do with the acid.”\n“If you dispose of it, please do so with utmost care. While the acid of these insects cannot eat through metal or many conventional materials, it is extremely quick to dissolve any organic material.”\nErin nodded. She carefully put the glass jar back in its corner and stood up.\n“Right. Um. Want another piece of bread? Or would you like some more juice?”\nThe sight of the fresh bread and cup of juice made the mage’s face turn an indelicate shade of green. He patted his bloated stomach and\nerped\n. He covered his mouth with his hand, but Erin was pretty sure he’d nearly thrown up.\n“Maybe not, then.”\n“You have been most kind.”\nPisces stood up and clutched at his stomach. He wavered and cast his eyes towards the door.\n“Most kind. But the night is old, and I believe I shall retire.”\n“Are you sure? I could get you a bag of food to go.”\nHe turned a darker shade of green and waved a hand quickly at her.\n“You are very considerate, but no. No. I will be off. Thank you for your hospitality.”\n“It was nothing. Let me get the door for you—there. Careful on your way out.”\nShe saw Pisces out the door and then turned and looked back at the table he’d sat in. It was filled with empty plates and crumbs. She debated cleaning it up and then shook her head.\nCarefully, Erin picked her way across the inn. She walked over to the three filled jars of Acid Flies and made sure for the umpteenth time that the lids were secure and that she couldn’t see any flies still wriggling around inside.\nAmong the many things Erin had bought from Krshia, one of them was a chalkboard and piece of chalk. She’d meant to record things she needed on it, but now, Erin wiped the black slate clean and used her best handwriting as she wrote on the board. Then she propped it up on the bar’s counter.\nMenu:\nPasta w/sausage and onions – 3 cp. per plate.\nBlue juice – 2 cp. per glass.\nAcid Flies – 1 s. per plate\nShe dropped the chalk on the counter and cast her eyes back at the jars of dead flies. Erin shuddered. She rubbed at her arms and sat in her chair. Too close. Too close by far.\nIn a while, she’d fall asleep. In a while, she’d wake up screaming and then fall asleep again. She’d be haunted by the sound of\nbuzzing\nwings for the next week. But for the moment, Erin’s eyes closed.\n[Innkeeper Level 10!]\n[Skill – Alcohol Brewing obtained!]\n[Skill – Dangersense obtained!]\n“…I wonder if you can make fly cookies?”\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "Click.\nA single sound in the darkness. The sound was of two mandibles snapping together. Long pincers, like those of tiny ants, but scaled up for a body slightly shorter than most Humans, Drakes, and Gnolls. The mandibles were a last-ditch weapon; they were meant to lacerate and tear, but they were really for breaking up bits of food. They still frightened every species not insectile in nature.\nAs did the bodies in the shadows, milling about, each one moving independently of the others but adhering to a grand plan. Hunched figures barely more than ominous shadows became more visible when they stepped past a glowing strip of green fungus placed on the wall for illumination.\nA rounded shell on the back. Four arms.\nFour arms\nand two antennae, waving as the silent figures moved. They had somewhat rounded feet, but their creators had given them more support that they might walk upright.\nIn fact, they seldom fell, even in battle. If they fell, they landed on their beetle-like shell and would have to rock madly to swing themselves to their feet or be helped up. Not that they were supposed to fight.\nThese were but Workers. They scooped dirt out with their bare hands, loaded it into sacks they carried away, to move dirt and rock and roots, sometimes merely a dozen feet, then packed it into another wall in progress. They pounded the walls of the tunnel with their bare hands, and there were a hundred, all working in this long section of ground.\nWhat was it? A tunnel. A vast tunnel that had been in progress for a month. This group was no more than two dozen strong, but they could hear another group moving just to their left.\nThe thinning wall fell inward, revealing more Workers, more\nAntinium\nin the darkness, completing their section of the tunnel. The first group barely paused a second before they began shoveling the dirt aside. They were so efficient, so…similar that despite both groups beginning independently, without line of sight, they had reached this point at practically the same time.\nThese were Antinium. The Free Antinium of Liscor’s Hive. They worked far below Liscor in the sprawling Hive. And this was their entire world.\nDarkness. Dirt. If you found an edible root, pull it free and deposit it in a pile for sustenance. Rocks, another pile. Dirt went into the walls.\nWhen it grew too dark to see, one of the Workers would continue the strip of glowing fungus, providing just enough light for the Workers to tell what they were doing. But it was so dark and so claustrophobic, another species would go mad in this place.\nBoredom, anxiety, and the like were alien concepts to the Antinium. For the Workers below—there was no such thing as claustrophobia. There was no such thing as names or wants or even purpose. All these things were bad to ask of them.\nVery bad.\nAberrations appeared when you asked an Antinium questions.\nThe citizens of Liscor had long known to ignore them and only give basic instructions. Workers just performed tasks like sweeping, building, and hauling things. Only one Antinium had a name, and that was Senior Guardsman Klbkch, and everyone knew him from the war.\nThese Workers had no names. They had no purpose, either. They only did what they knew must be done. Because the Queen, or Prognugator Klbkch, had ordered them to.\nThat order was everything. Their orders were to dig. If one even thought about the future, they would know,\nknow\nthat at some point they would be told to leave their post and go eat. Then they would eat, scooping the nutritional paste into their mouths. Then sleep in their assigned spots. Then wake.\nAnd then? Then they would work. Or fight.\nFight in the darkness.\nAll the Workers froze a second as a sound echoed through this place.\nClick.\nA pair of mandibles snapped together. The Workers froze because the sound was an interruption, an unneeded waste of movement. The auditory disruption to their perfect cycle was the lesser cause, though. Or rather, not the only reason.\nThey listened for scraping, for rustling or chittering or growls not here, but ahead of them.\nPast a thin layer of dirt, at any moment, a hand might reveal a roaming eye. Or teeth. Or a glowing body and too many legs and blades to count.\nThen they would fight, and many would die until Soldiers arrived. The Workers did not fear this. It was. But they did listen.\nThe scrape of their hands pulling loose dirt was the entire world. The feel of the sack in hand, the pale green glow amid black-brown bodies their only existence.\nFew Workers ever saw the surface. They knew it existed. If an intruder entered the Hive, Soldiers would kill them. If an army came, they would fight to the death to keep them from the Queen.\nOnly Prognugator Klbkch went above regularly. He chose Workers to perform duties above. Soldiers were not allowed above. Above was a strange place for Workers, filled with non-Antinium people and rules you must obey about streets, but you\nfollowed orders.\nOne of the many Workers had gone above yesterday. He had been sweeping a street that was dirty. He swept from dawn till dusk, and then he went below.\nIt was an easy task, sweeping dirt. It was not the same as having a cascade of dirt shower down as he accidentally loosened the supports of the tunnel. He was buried in an instant and lay there for six minutes until the other Workers unburied him and he got up to work.\nAntinium were built to withstand poison. They tired less easily than other species. They could survive being buried alive and fight on even as they bled from multiple wounds or losses of limbs. They were a species so unique even the rest of the world’s many species found them—strange.\nEven so. The Worker who had gone above wished not to be buried again and took care to make sure he did not make the same mistake. He had no desires. He had no wishes.\nBut if he could have chosen, he would have gone above again. For there was something up on the surface.\nColor. A breeze from the pale blue sky that changed to a fiery red he had never imagined in his existence. The Workers who went above did not speak to the others. Workers seldom spoke because there was no point.\nAnd yet that sky…the smells from the place called Market Street and that entire moment stood out more to the Worker than his entire life below. He had even seen something strange.\nThe entire world above was strange. Drakes and Gnolls ignored you, and nothing made sense. Sometimes, one might curse or throw rocks at you, but that was rarer these years compared to the beginning.\nNot that any Worker here had lived long enough to remember the beginning, ten years ago when the Free Hive had been founded here. Only Klbkch had been there. He and the Free Queen.\nBut there had been something that almost—\nalmost\nmade sense, above. The Worker kept remembering it.\nIt was a board of black and white pieces and tiles. Nothing made sense to a Worker. He did not understand why lips rose and curved, or what laughter was, or why water would come from a small Drake’s eyes. He did not understand why food looked different every time above, or why there was no tunnel overhead, bare feet above his antennae.\nBut he liked that board because it had rules. It made sense. He had watched as each piece moved according to its place.\nThat made sense to him. He actually understood it as the Human girl played with the Drakes and even Prognugator Klbkch.\nThat was—\nClick.\nA third time a mandible clicked, and this time, as one, every single Worker turned and stared at the Antinium who had made the sound.\nIt was not the Worker who had gone above. It was, in fact, another Worker, ubiquitous to the rest, who froze slightly.\nClick.\nWhy did it make that sound? There was no need. There was no danger—and this Worker still made the noise. It stood out. It was…\nan Aberration?\nSome of the Workers backed away, wondering if this were how they died. But this Worker did not shriek. It did not kill, as Aberrations always did when they appeared. It trembled slightly—then made the sound again.\nClick, click, click.\nThere was almost a kind of…rhythm to it. As if the clicking were more than a warning or accidental rubbing of mandibles. Almost like what the Antinium had no name for. A thing heard on the surface.\nA song.\n—But that was not right. Antinium did not, should not make sound. One began to hurry off to find a Soldier or Klbkch. When either arrived, this Worker would die. Then silence and normality would resume. This is what would happen.\nThe clicking Worker continued to snap its mandibles together as the one who had gone above tried to make it quiet.\nClick, click…click click click…\nhe listened as the other Worker ran to find a Soldier.\nThen the walls imploded, and a screaming, fleshy creature stuck its head out the side of the cave. It was\nthin\n, but so long it twisted into the tunnel, fourteen feet long, grabbing the running Worker and tearing its head off in a single twist as two long tendrils shot out. The clicking Worker and the one who had gone above recoiled in a moment of terror and then reaction and adrenaline.\nThen it was death and battle. Green blood, running as Workers began to fight for their lives and more monsters poured out the tunnels. The two Workers, the one who made sounds and the one who went above, fought, punching with their bare hands, tearing at shrieking moths with mouths like razors fluttering everywhere—\nWas this now death?\nNo. Seconds into the battle, Soldiers arrived. They crashed into\nthe fighting, swinging their fists, bigger, stronger than the Workers. They died too—but the monsters fell as a wave of bodies rushed over them.\nFour Workers out of sixty survived the carnage unscathed. Many of the survivors had lost limbs; some died before their wounds were staunched with a gel, and others were…no longer useful. They were left to die too. The rest stood there, blood and bodies leaking, Antinium and monster alike.\nThen—more Workers arrived to pick up the dead for processing, Antinium and monsters both. More Workers pushed past the two covered in monster blood and their own green blood and began digging out the tunnel.\nThe two Workers who had survived looked around, then stood against a wall as a figure strode past Soldiers milling around the breach in the Hive. He was known to them.\nKnown to them all. The Worker who had been clicking trembled, and the other one stared as Klbkch walked forwards.\nHe wore no armor of a [Guard] down here. Only a loincloth—unnecessary since they were all the same body, chitinous armor, not flesh. But what marked him apart from the others were the two swords which hung at his sides, the belt of magical items.\nThe swords were bared and shone in the faint moss-light. Normally, they only came out to slay Aberrations. Or kill monsters.\n“Another breach. The fifth this week. Casualties mount. My Queen—we cannot continue this rate of attrition.”\nHe spoke, not to the Workers—why would he, except to give orders?—but to the unseen presence in their heads. The being who governed this Hive and sent Workers to their tasks. She seldom\nspoke\n—but they knew her will.\nThe Queen.\nOh, the Queen—\nand Klbkch was the only one who spoke to her. Her reply came more as thought than word. It was exhausted, like the last vestiges of energy that came after the mania of a day without sleep, without rest. She seldom slept but managed the Hive, kept the monsters at bay.\n“\nYes. The plan must be completed quickly, Klbkch.\n”\nThe Workers didn’t know what this meant, but the survivors stood there as Klbkch nodded.\n“I shall expedite it at once. Five teams of Workers have already perished, but we are near completion. You four. And you…sixteen. Follow me.”\nThe four survivors from the original dig group and sixteen new Workers instantly stepped forwards and followed Klbkch. He gave them no orders; they simply followed him through the Hive.\nClick.\nThis time, only the Worker who had gone above and swept heard the sound. It was so infinitesimally small that only he heard it—and the Worker next to him who clicked his mandibles together.\nClick, click, click—\nthe sounds continued. Had he been doing this the entire time?\nStop.\nIf Klbkch heard, he would kill the Worker. But the Worker continued as they wound their way up through the Hive, through secret tunnels no one knew about, that were not supposed to exist.\nWhen they emerged—they saw the sky.\nIt hung above them, and the Workers all froze for half a second as they saw black night above. Like the cavern, but so wonderfully vast. And\nstars.\nColors never known to the other Workers shone down, winking under a blue moon that hung waning in the sky.\n“Follow. In silence. We must not be detected.”\nKlbkch made the Workers spring to attention. They followed, keeping low, as he led them past Liscor’s walls.\nThey should not be here.\nThey knew that—Antinium were not allowed outside the city—but Klbkch was watching the walls cautiously.\nHe was not Senior Guardsman Klbkch here. So he led twenty Workers to a plot of land by a hill, far enough from the city that the Workers were able to feel the soft, foreign grass below their feet, stare at the sky, even flinch as something passed overhead, squeaking.\nA…flappy thing? The Worker who clicked stared up at it and followed it with its head. Such strange things—but the Worker who swept was afraid.\nHe realized that if five teams of Workers had died, the sixth might be this very group. Yet he did not do anything.\nHe was Antinium. This was his purpose.",

    "text": "Klbkch came to a halt by a strange area along one vast hillside. Higher than most. He pointed, and the Workers saw an area of disturbed grass covered over to look from afar like regular hillside. It was, in fact, the opening to a tunnel.\n“Within you will dig. There is a door. Reach it. If monsters attack, kill them. Dig—you have until morning.”\nThe Workers slowly filed into the tight opening and found a far vaster complex within. And…the bodies of other Workers. Most were torn to pieces, but they recognized parts of a head, shell—the Workers trembled, but they saw the outlines of a door.\nIt was open.\nIt was so tall that they had to create dirt footholds just to climb up and dig it out, then haul more soil and dead bodies away. Not all the bodies were Workers. Klbkch stood outside, watching the moons move as the Workers hollowed the tunnel.\nThe door itself had been forced open by the sheer pressure of earth and stone. Weathered stone\nstraining\nagainst the weight of hills in the deep gloom for centuries, perhaps even longer, until one gave and let in mundane dirt and grass and roots into a place quiet and untouched for aeons.\nWaking what lay within.\nBut the Antinium had been the first visitors to this place, and the desperate crew shoveled dirt. The gloom beyond the entrance seemed to be alive—as if inspecting their presence and inviting them to step further within. Or perhaps something inside was simply moving.\nChoosing its moment to strike.\nEvery second, the Worker who swept waited for something to come\nthrough\nthe door. Klbkch had drawn his blades; he was waiting too. He stood in the doorway, dividing darkness and moonlight with his blades—and it seemed like that was the only thing that gave the silent shadows pause as they lengthened. The Workers knew this truce might be broken at any minute, in the next second.\nBut nothing came.\nHe heard…rustling from beyond, as if something listened to the Workers, but perhaps it was no longer hungry.\nHours passed as the Workers dug, frantically, and then Klbkch glanced inside the hollowed complex and spoke.\n“The sun is rising in two hours. This will do.”\nAll the Workers froze.\nThis would what?\nThe door was now unearthed, and a large, hollow space existed in the hill, hidden by the grassy embankment above. Klbkch eyed the tunnel, then gave the strangest order yet.\n“Collapse the opening. The door should be visible from above; no signs of any tunneling. Work fast. We have less than an hour.”\nThe Workers milled about, loosening dirt, pulling apart the supports they had dug. When the first showers began, the Worker who clicked looked up, and the tunnel began to fall—but the Worker who swept grabbed him and pulled him to safety.\nIn the darkness before dawn, the entire structure that six teams of Workers had dug out finally fell, and an entire hillside cascaded down as they ran to join Klbkch. Twenty Workers stared at the hillside, now visibly crumpled inwards from a distance.\nKlbkch eyed the debris and ruins of their work. The Workers did not understand; they saw a bit of that foreign door poking out of the hillside, but it was blocked again by dirt. And now…\nThe door was closed.\nThe Worker who swept felt a strange prickling sensation in his body.\nWhen had that happened?\nBut he said nothing, lest Klbkch think he was Aberration. And the Prognugator seemed pleased by this.\n“Good. Very good. Go back and rest. This will do.”\nSo, like that, twenty Workers went back to the secret tunnels and to their Hive and ate before they headed to their holes and slept. The next day, they would have more orders and live or die.\nIt was all they knew. They had no notion of what they had done or even thought long about how close they had come to dying. Antinium blood was still flaking off the sweeping Worker’s chitin. And still…he saw that game of chess, playing in front of his eyes. Again and again, a beautiful thing not like this Hive. He slept and dreamed of that, a rarity, the first dream in his life aside from the dreams he had of the sky and floating up away from the Hive.\nHe only woke up when he heard a faint clicking from the Antinium in the cubby hole next to him. He clicked and clicked, like a little song, late into the night. And this time, no Antinium stopped him.\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "“Baking soda.”\nKrshia shook her head. Once more, she stood at her shop counter, this time sharpening a knife with a whetstone as a product demo. She was selling whetstones and knives. She seemed very familiar with both; there wasn’t much chance she would cut herself as she applied more water to the whetstone.\nErin hadn’t known you sharpened knives with, well, a\nstone.\nOr that you got it wet. Hence the name. Krshia had laughed the entire time—until she realized Erin was serious. And when the Human girl described the idea of the ingredient she needed, the Gnoll rested her chin on her paw and frowned mightily.\n“I know not what that is. I have many things which can be baked, but none of this ‘soda.’”\nErin groaned. She felt she shouldn’t be surprised, but she still hated being surprised.\n“How about baking powder? Everyone has baking powder!”\nAgain, Krshia shook her head.\n“What is this powder supposed to bake, Erin Solstice?”\n“Cookies.”\n“And what are these ‘cookies’?”\nErin gaped at Krshia.

    "text": "Thirty minutes of Krshia laughing and snorting at her later, Erin Solstice was walking back to her inn. She kicked at the clumpy grass, too mad to even admire the orange tint to the patch she was walking through. She was mad.\n“Stupid worlds that don’t have ice cream. Stupid Gnolls who act nice and look at me like I’m insane. How does anyone\nlive\nwithout ice cream and cookies?”\nErin grumbled to herself as she trudged back to her inn. She kicked the knee-high grass and wished she had a lawnmower the size of a skyscraper. Maybe then her legs wouldn’t itch so much after walking—\nClickclickclickclickclickclickclickclickclickclickclick—\nA familiar sound across the plains. It made Erin’s blood go cold. She stopped, listened, and then saw it.\nA gigantic, grey, craggy rock seemed to be levitating across the grasslands. But that was only an illusion. If you looked closer, you’d see many legs churning up the soil underneath the rock. But Erin had no intention of getting that close. She knew what was making that sound and what was living under that rock.\nIt was a Rock Crab. Erin froze and then turned to run. But it wasn’t coming at her.\nInstead, the gigantic rock was propelling itself across the grasslands quite quickly. Its rapidly shuffling legs tore up the earth as it ran. But it wasn’t chasing anything. Was it running away? From what?\nErin got her answer as a bunch of much smaller figures surged over the crest of a hill, chasing the Rock Crab. Goblins.\nGoblins? Chasing a Rock Crab?\nWhat a ridiculous statement. Erin was amazed to see the same group that had been around her inn when the Chieftain…her smile vanished, but it came back when she saw the silly sight.\nA huge Rock Crab, half as large as a house, was scurrying across the grass, surging down a hill as little green figures, short and waving weapons, pursued it. Erin had been in that situation, but she hadn’t weighed—what—thousands of pounds? Yet the crab fled the tiny group of eight, and Erin wondered if the Goblins had scared it with seedpods. That was the only thing she could think of.\nAt first, Erin grinned at the sight, but her smile faded as more and more of them appeared. First there were eight. Then ten. Then twenty—\nforty—\nYiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyi—\nThat was a lot of them.\nErin’s smile vanished as she heard that familiar, dangerous sound. The Goblins were screaming a warcry of their own as they chased the Rock Crab. The crab seemed to sense them behind it and sped up, but it was still too slow. As Erin watched in amazement, the first Goblin leapt and managed to cling to the Rock Crab’s shell.\nInstantly, it swung around and threw the Goblin off. From underneath the Rock Crab’s shell, a large claw appeared and\nsnapped\nat the Goblin. Erin covered her mouth as the Goblin\nscreamed\nand held up a bloody stump of an arm.\nBut even as the Rock Crab surged towards the injured Goblin, more Goblins leapt at it. It swung around, trying to knock them away, but although it knocked several Goblins flying, many more dodged its claw and charged at the Rock Crab, screaming wildly.\nThe Goblins swarmed the Rock Crab. Erin watched, open-mouthed as the giant land crustacean snapped and struck out with its claws. Three Goblins fell away, severely cut and bleeding. One was missing a hand, but the others—\nThey swarmed over the rocky shell, bashing it with clubs. They ducked underneath it as well, biting, stabbing,\ntearing\n.\nErin couldn’t see what was happening as more and more Goblins crawled underneath the Rock Crab’s shell, but she saw it spasm. It\nclicked\nrapidly in pain and swiped at the Goblins, but they were too close for its claws to grab at. A baby blue liquid seeped from beneath the shell. The giant Rock Crab collapsed, and slimy, blue Goblins dripping in entrails and crab shell emerged from underneath.\nErin backed away slowly. Her heart was pounding a million times per second. She imagined what would happen if one of the Goblins glanced over at her. They’d rush her and cover her in an instant.\nBut they were all intent on their kill. The Goblins were ripping the Rock Crab apart, hungrily scarfing down its guts. It was a sight to make Erin nauseous, but her stomach was already clenched tight from fear.\nEventually, she thought she was far enough away. Erin turned and ran.",

    "text": "Most of the other Goblins didn’t see the departing Human. They were too busy cracking the Rock Crab’s hard shell and scooping out its slimy entrails. They feasted.\nBut a few Goblins did notice the Human. One with ragged clothes, the smallest of the tribe, stopped biting into the Rock Crab’s bitter flesh to watch the young woman leave. The Goblin gripped something in her pocket tightly. Soon. It would be soon.\nThe ragged pouch of coin jingled softly as the Goblin shook it. The littlest looked around quickly, but the other Goblins were too busy gorging themselves to notice the small sound. The female Goblin stowed her pouch of coins among her ragged clothes. Then she went back to eat as much as she could.\nThe warriors let her pass. They were grunting, tearing bits of raw crab off to eat. There was no Chieftain. The Chieftain was dead—the tribe might have fractured or fallen apart, but they would eat well today, and they might have lots of food till later.\nAll because they’d hunted a Rock Crab.\nWithout the Chieftain!\nThe tribe hadn’t been certain it would work, but—the Chieftain had never run fast enough to kill the crabs anyways. If they could do it with him just shouting for them to ‘run faster’—why couldn’t they try to do it one last time?\nThat was what the littlest Goblin had suggested, and the warriors had taken her suggestion because everyone was hungry. Now, they glanced at her and let her grab a juicy bit of the crab’s stomach. The littlest Goblin didn’t like whatever it was—it was wet, slimy, and bitter. But she felt her pouch full of shiny coins.\nSoon.",

    "text": "When Relc and Klbkch tried the door to the Wandering Inn, they found it was locked. Only after Relc had knocked twice did the door open a crack. When Erin finally let the two in, she bolted the door as soon as they were inside.\nRelc raised one non-existent eyebrow and flicked his tail idly at Erin.\n“What’s gotten into you?”\n“Greetings, Miss Solstice. Is something wrong?”\nErin looked warily out the window, but felt better with Relc and Klbkch in the building.\n“Goblins.”\n“Goblins?”\nRelc laughed as he and Klbkch sat themselves at one of the tables.\n“What, are they throwing rocks at you again? If you want, I could—um, scare them. But Goblins? Seriously? After you killed their Chieftain, what’s there to worry about?”\n“How about a group of Goblins that can kill a giant rock-crab-thing in seconds?”\nErin snapped at Relc as the Drake laughed.\n“It was the scariest thing I’ve seen. Some kind of raiding party swarmed over the crab and—”\n“A raiding party?”\nRelc sat up in his chair and grabbed for his spear.\n“Where, and how many? Come on, Klbkch. We can head them off—”\nHe jumped to his feet. Erin waved her hands frantically.\n“No, no! There’s way too many of them. Besides, I don’t want you to kill them! That would be—”\nRelc interrupted Erin as Klbkch watched her silently. The Antinium’s hands were on his weapons too.\n“Look, if there’s a raiding party out there, we need to take care of it. I can ignore a few Goblins, but a few hundred of them roaming around? That’s a threat.”\nHe went for the door, but Erin dragged him back. Or rather, tried to. Her feet slid uselessly across the ground, and he didn’t even seem to notice her weight.\n“Exactly how many Goblins were in this group you observed, Miss Solstice?”\nKlbkch interrupted Erin’s futile struggling as Relc paused by the door.\n“Well—”\nErin had to think.\n“Not more than forty, I guess.”\nRelc blinked and stopped unbolting the door. He looked back at Klbkch and then down at Erin. Slowly, he walked back to his chair. Then he sat down in it and started to laugh.\nErin gaped as Relc chuckled and then transitioned into full-scale guffaws of mirth. He covered his face with one claw and pounded the table with the other.\n“Just what’s so funny?”\n“A raiding party, she says! Hah!”\n“I fear you were under a slight misapprehension, Miss Solstice.”\n“Oh yeah?”\n“Yeah!”\nRelc finally managed to get his laughter under control when Klbkch stepped on one of his feet. He wiped tears out of his eyes and grinned at Erin.\n“That’s just the local tribe. Forty Goblins? Please. I could take out half of them without breaking a sweat. Between me and Klbkch, we could kill all of them—”\nHe broke off and cleared his throat.\n“Not that we would.”\nKlbkch nodded.\n“Despite their competency, a Goblin tribe is no threat to any but lone stragglers, Miss Solstice. On the other hand, a small raiding party is usually comprised of at least three hundred Goblins. Larger groups have been known to exceed a thousand individuals.”\nErin gulped.\n“That’s not a raiding party. That’s an army.”\n“Not if you’re a Goblin.”\nRelc’s expression became serious as he leaned back in his chair.\n“Yeah, like Klbkch said, a Goblin tribe isn’t dangerous. Maybe to you—but you killed their Chieftain, so I doubt they’d be brave enough to attack this place. Besides, if you lock the doors and windows, they’ll have a hard time getting in. But when Goblins start appearing in numbers? That’s when things get nasty.”\nShe heard the silent cue and took it.\n“How nasty?”\nKlbkch leaned forwards over the table.\n“Extremely. Although Goblins are considered a minor threat by most settlements of any size, when they do appear in numbers, they are fully capable of wiping out villages, cities, and even nations in the past.”\n“Get out.”\n“It is quite true, Miss Solstice.”\nRelc nodded.\n“I’ve heard stories of the Goblin Crusades. And witnessed one myself. The last time one occurred, multiple armies of Goblins rampaged throughout the north and sailed across to the Human continent, Terandria. There were at least a hundred thousand Goblins in each army, and their King had a million Goblins at his back when we pushed his forces out of the south. The Bloodfields.”\nHe stopped talking for a moment, and his arm tensed around his cup.\n“Bastard. The north got him in the end. But it felt like you couldn’t see anything but smoke everywhere you looked. I heard the north was ash in some parts of it. They nearly took First Landing.”\nErin felt like she needed a history class or at least a map. Yet Relc’s face was suddenly set and Klbkch was quiet. She hesitated—but she had to ask.\n“Bloodfields? What’s that?”\nRelc snapped out of his fugue and blinked. Then he looked amused again.\n“Oh come on! You don’t know about…? Even if you’re foreign, the Bloodfields are famous! It used to be a battlefield. Well, it still is. Lots of armies fight there, and so much blood has been spilled that the entire place has changed. The entire area is full of Blood Grass. Very nasty. Drinks blood and eats people if they’re not careful. I fought there twice.”\n“Oh.”\nErin felt like she should say something else, but Relc’s expression had grown uncharacteristically serious. She searched for something else to say.\n“Then…the Goblin tribe isn’t that dangerous?”\nRelc flicked his tail dismissively.\n“Not to me or Klbkch. Just don’t walk into them, and you should be fine. Most people can outrun a tribe unless they get trapped anyways.”\n“But they killed a Rock Crab!”\n“Yeah, what’s that?”\n“You know, that giant thing that hides under a rock? It goes\nclickclickclickclick—\n”\n“Oh,\nthat\n. Is that what you Humans call it? We just call them Hollowstone Deceivers. What’s a crab?”\n“A creature that lives in the sea, I believe. The name is quite apt.”\n“Whatever. It’s not that tough.”\nErin blinked at Relc.\n“It’s not?”\nHe waved a hand at her dismissively.\n“Oh, we’ve got a lot more freaky monsters living around here. Way more dangerous. They’re just all sleeping or somewhere else this time of year.”\n“Or underground.”\n“Yeah, or that.”\nThat didn’t sound good to Erin at all.\n“I haven’t seen any of these other monsters. Just the dinosaur birds.”\nKlbkch nodded.\n“That is appropriate for the season. At this time of the year, the Floodplains contain few creatures besides the Goblins. Aside from grazing herds, most animals—”\n“Herds? You guys have herds?”\nAgain, Klbkch nodded.\n“They are usually confined in villages to the north of Liscor. The city hosts many pigs, sheep, horses—”\nRelc nodded and smacked his lips.\n“Delicious. They’re great if you eat them half-raw. Speaking of which, got any food?”\n“Oh, right. Sorry.”\nErin got up and mechanically began placing dishes on the table.\n“Dinner will just be a few minutes while I warm everything up on the embers. Uh, what other creatures haven’t I seen yet?”\nRelc scratched his head.\n“What else? Um. What about Shield Spiders? They’re probably hiding in their tunnels right now, but they’re still around…watch where you step or you’ll fall into a nest.”\nKlbkch twitched as Relc mentioned the spiders. Erin twitched too, and her skin crawled at the thought. Relc grinned at both and shook his head.\n“Don’t worry. It’s not the right season for them. You’ll see a lot more wildlife around here when the new year begins. This is the quietest time of the year, actually. Once the rains start, you’ll see a ton of weird creatures, and then when it stops, all the animals that travel come here to graze. And in the winter, it gets\nreally\ndangerous. There’s these things called Winter Sprites, which are a pain in the tail…”\n“Wonderful. I bet everyone comes here to see all the monsters who want to suck your face off.”\nIt might have been that Drakes were impervious to sarcasm. Or it might have just been Relc’s natural obliviousness. He nodded happily as he licked his lips.\n“We used to get a lot of travel down south. But that all stopped when the damn Necromancer appeared.”\n“Necromancer? You mean Pisces?”\n“That weakling mage? No. I mean the bad Necromancer that nearly destroyed the city about ten years ago. Is the food ready yet?”\n“Not yet. So that’s why you guys hate the undead?”\nKlbkch shook his head as Relc glanced longingly towards the kitchen where good smells were beginning to waft out.\n“I believe the Necromancer did not help public perception, but the undead have always been considered a threat, Miss Solstice. It is said that the three most dangerous things to Liscor are rain, the undead, and war.”\n“I can see war, but why rain and the undead?”\n“Bah. They’re the real threats. War? Huh. We don’t fear\nwar\n. Our army fights in wars—far south of here! They send back loot, but no one attacks Liscor! We’re too far, and the Bloodfields are in the way.”\n“That is true. Most residents of Liscor do not fear war. I personally deem this unwise given the volatile nature of conflict between nations on this continent.”\n“Hah! Even if all the northern and southern cities burn, Liscor will never fall!”\nRelc slammed a fist on the table and then looked at Erin beseechingly.\n“Can I at least have a drink? Blue fruit juice?”\n“Oh, of course. Just a second.”\nErin hurried into the kitchen to grab glasses and the pitcher of freshly-squeezed juice. When she got back, she heard Klbkch and Relc arguing.\n“—The certainty of Drakes in the impregnability of Liscor seems unwise. My people have brought up the need for increased vigilance to your governing body, but—”\n“What’s the problem with the Watch, huh? You’re part of it. You know we can take care of any monsters that appear. And if an army does come here, so what? There’s only two ways into this valley. North and south. The mountains are practically impassable, and the Bloodfields guard the southern border. Even if an army comes through, the Floodplains will cut off any chance of siege. What don’t you get about that?”\n“The north is still relatively unguarded. If the Humans were to unite under the Five Families—”\n“Human cities?”\nErin leaned over the table and nearly spilled juice all over Relc. She looked at the two.\n“There are Humans around here? Where?”\n“To the north. Duh.”\nRelc raised his eyebrows while Erin struggled not to throttle him. Klbkch glanced sideways at Erin and then back to his drink.\n“And? Um, what do the Human cities do?”\nRelc frowned as he poked at his claws with a fork as if testing how sharp it was.\n“Who knows? They’re Humans. We have an okay relationship with them. They don’t come over here and stomp on our tails, and we don’t eat them.”\nErin sagged slightly. Klbkch kicked Relc under the table, and the Drake glanced up at Erin. His eyes widened.\n“Oh. Um, uh, like I was saying to Klbkch, Liscor would never fall! Even if an army did attack from the north, we could just recall our army. Unless they could breach our walls in a week or less, the army would come running right back and smash them. See?”\n“Is your army really that great?”\nRelc nodded proudly as Klbkch indicated his agreement.\n“The Liscorian army is famous. Don’t you know? We fight battles for other cities, and they pay us to kick our enemies to shreds. We field two thousand Drakes and a few hundred Gnolls at any given moment with officer classes. Those are just the\nofficers.\nNow, we don’t have that many soldiers per officer—sometimes as low as two, but that’s Liscor strategy. When there’s a big battle coming, it’s as many as eighteen per officer. Now, I know that sounds like a small army to you, but their average Level is 17. How about that, then?”\nShe wasn’t sure what to make of that. It sounded quite low.\n“Um. It’s good?”\n“\nGood?\nIt’s great! The average level of soldiers in other armies is Level 8.\nEight.\nThey have low-level [Conscripts] or [Militia] who don’t see battles. Ours are veterans. Get it?”\nShe did. And when Relc put it that way, it\nwas\nimpressive.\n“So the, uh, Liscorian army is twice as strong as other armies?”\nKlbkch shook his head.\n“That is not entirely correct. Levels cannot replace tactics or numerical superiority, or equipment, for that matter. However, it is still a potent deterrent to larger forces. That allows the Liscorian army to fight as a mercenary force without prolonged engagements.”\n“Exactly. Any army that runs up against ours knows that if things get serious, they’ll bleed for every soldier they bring down. That’s why we can earn so much money fighting abroad.”\n“So are they here? In the city, I mean?”\n“Nah. They’re almost always out on some campaign. The Liscorian army fights wherever. I think they were in the east, fighting near one of the Walled Cities. Oteslia, probably. They’re easy to siege.”\nThat all made a sort of sense to Erin, although she was having a hard time thinking of a parallel with her world. That was also because she hated history class. But she vaguely recalled the Mongols doing something similar. Or was it the Turks? The Swiss? Now she had no idea.\nBut Erin did have one question. She raised an eyebrow at Relc.\n“So your army goes out and fights for money? Isn’t that dangerous if someone attacks here?”\n“Exactly my point. If a stranger to our city can identify the weak spot so quickly, why is the populace so resistant to any suggestions regarding defense?”\nRelc shook his head at both Klbkch and Erin angrily.\n“Like I said, Liscor’s got a lot of natural defenses. Besides, what army in their right minds would want to attack the one city with an Antinium Hive?”\nErin sensed her food was nice and warm, but that last word bothered her. She lingered, her hands on the table.\n“A what? An Antinium Hive? Is that unique?”\nRelc opened his mouth to laugh in her face—then he saw her genuine expression and waved his hand at Klbkch. As for the Antinium, he gave Erin a long look as Relc explained.\n“This city. Liscor. It’s home to a bunch of Antinium—not the violent kind, the peaceful ones. But they live here, so that makes it a Hive. One of six in the world. The Black Tide, the Antinium from Rhir—we are the\nonly\ncity that allowed a Hive to be created. Because they helped fight off the Necromancer. ‘sprobably why no one wants to visit anymore. But hey, it makes us special. And the Ants do help a bit. Right, Klbkch?”\nErin turned to look at Klbkch. He nodded in agreement.\n“We have a standing contract with the people of Liscor. In exchange for our presence, we provide services and goods to the city. It is a mutually beneficial arrangement.”\n“Yeah, it was weird having the Antinium around, but it turned out to be a good idea.”\nRelc shrugged.\n“Anyways, the bottom line is that the Ants defend the city if we’re ever attacked and help out with construction and other jobs. They send some of their people to work in jobs, like Klbkch here. And in return, we let them stay.”\n“That doesn’t sound too fair. What’s in it for the Antinium?”\nRelc looked amused.\n“No one kills them. You think the Hives would be allowed\nanywhere\nelse? All five of the other ones are in the Hivelands, and we’d be at war with them if the Walled Cities thought they’d win. This is the only city where Drakes, Gnolls, and Antinium mix. It’s probably why we’re not in the middle of a third Antinium War. To everyone else, they’re the monsters who should be destroyed.”\nErin looked at Klbkch. He didn’t seem inclined to disagree, but she did.\n“They seem pretty good to me. Although Klbkch is the only one I’ve ever met. But he doesn’t cause trouble or call Humans names or do anything bad. Unlike certain Drakes I could name.”\n“Thank you, Miss Solstice.”\nRelc glared as Klbkch bowed his head. He flicked his tail back and forth on the ground and growled.\n“Oh, the Ants are great. They’re quiet, they don’t get drunk, and they’re about as interesting as wood—until one of them goes crazy.”\nKlbkch nodded.\n“The strain of madness has not been eliminated from the current generation. We have reduced the average instance of insanity by 14% per year, but we must remain vigilant.”\n“What? Fourteen…\nwhat?\nCan you explain that bit to me?”",

    "text": "Klbkch nodded and opened his mandibles, but Relc’s stomach audibly growled. He poked Erin in the side, which made her jump and earned him a foot-stomp from Klbkch, but he didn’t seem to notice. He whined at Erin.\n“You can talk about the crazy Ants later. But right now…\nfood?\n”\nErin dithered, but relented at last at the desperate look in Relc’s eyes.\n“Oh,\nfine.\n”\nShe went into the kitchen and began lugging out a pot of soup, a basket of warm bread—a bit too dry from being near the embers—and her standard pasta with sausage and onions. Relc began to salivate the instant he saw the food.\n“Sorry it took so long. I wanted to tell you guys about the Goblins, so I forgot to heat stuff up.”\n“No problem, no problem. Just put it here and all is forgiven. And oh yeah, we’ve got news too!”\nRelc rubbed his claws together eagerly as Erin brought out plates and bowls.\n“Ooh, is that soup? And bread? And pasta! That’s a lot of food!”\n“Yeah, well, I was celebrating earlier. I cooked up a lot by accident.”\n“Celebrathing? Celebrathing whu?”\nIt was hard to understand the Drake as he spoke through a mouth already bursting with food. Erin politely averted her eyes as she replied.\n“Oh, you know. Not dying.”\n“’S good! Good to celebrath!”\nRelc washed down his mouthful of bread and cheese with a cup full of blue fruit juice. Erin had other liquids for sale now too; regular apple juice and a refreshing minty drink, but the Drake had developed a taste for the sticky blue fruit drink.\n“I would like a bowl of soup too, if it would not trouble you, Miss Solstice.”\nErin glanced over at Klbkch and remembered. She put a frown on her face.\n“Wait a minute. Is soup another one of those things Antinium can’t eat?”\nKlbkch ducked his head.\n“I assure you, soup is completely palatable to my kind.”\nErin glanced over at Relc, who nodded agreeably as he stuffed his mouth with pasta. She put her hands on her hips.\n“Okay, but I’m still mad about the pasta thing. So tell me—and I hope to god this is true or I’ll be really upset. Tell me, do the Antinium eat bugs or worms or stuff like that?”\nKlbkch looked up into Erin’s face and hesitated.\n“I would not like to offend your sensibilities with a description of my diet, Miss Solstice—”\n“Offend away, by all means.”\nAgain, he hesitated.\n“My kind is fully capable of digesting most dishes eaten by humanoids. However, it is true that if offered we will eat creatures Humans and Drakes deem unsavory. We do not tend to consume such meals in public—”\n“Right, no problem! Just wait here!”\nErin skidded into the kitchen and began banging pots and plates together. Relc and Klbkch exchanged a puzzled glance until she walked back into the room carrying a heaping bowl of black things as far away from her as she could.\n“Whath tha?”\nGingerly, Erin set the bowl full of Acid Flies on the table. Relc looked at it curiously, but Klbkch leaned towards the bowl as if suddenly hypnotized.\n“These are—well, they’re these flying acid bugs that I found. I wasn’t sure if you’d want it, Klbkch, but I thought it was worth a try and—”\nKlbkch picked up a spoon and began shoveling the black insect torsos into his ‘mouth’. Erin shut up. She also looked away. As much as she liked Klbkch, the\ncrunching\nsounds and the sight of him eating the flies was hard to stomach.\n“Looksh good.”\nRelc swallowed his mouthful and reached out a hand. Without missing a beat, Klbkch slapped it away from his bowl. Both Relc and Erin stared in surprise at Klbkch.\n“Um, can I have a bowl too, Erin?”\n“You want some? Oh, uh, do lizards—”\nRelc glared, and Erin amended her words hastily.\n“—\nDrakes\nlike bugs?”\n“Not as much as this guy, but I wouldn’t mind trying some. I’ve eaten worse on campaign.”\nDutifully, Erin brought another bowl out. Relc tasted the bugs and munched a few down experimentally.\n“Ooh, nice and crunchy! I didn’t know you could eat these things. How’d you manage to get rid of all the acid?”\n“It’s a long story. It involves blood and—actually, I’d rather hear your news. What is it?”\nRelc looked blank. Then he snapped his fingers. Erin was surprised he could with his scaly hands.\n“Right, oh yeah. It’s terrible news! Guess what? Some idiot found a bunch of ruins to the northeast of the city, and it’s apparently some ancient dungeon! Now, every adventurer in miles is coming here to explore it!”\nErin frowned.\n“Is that a bad thing? I thought finding old ruins and exploring them is what adventurers do. It’s what happens in all the games I, uh—well, it’s what adventurers do, right? Doesn’t Liscor have an Adventurer’s Guild?”\n“Yeah, but they don’t have many members. Not many idiots in our city bother becoming adventurers since there’s not much to do around here. If you want to fight, you join the army or the Watch. It’s Humans who are the stupid—um…uh…”\nErin pretended not to hear that.\n“You don’t like adventurers, is that what I’m hearing? Why? Don’t they kill monsters?”\n“Yeah, and they cause trouble. They pick fights when they’re drunk, they run away from tough monsters, and they’re rude to guardsmen.”\nRelc slammed his cup down on the table.\n“Adventurers. I hate them so much.”\nKlbkch nodded. He dropped his spoon into his bowl with a\nclatter\n. Erin blinked and looked down. The bowl she’d filled was huge, twice as big as a soup bowl. He held it up to her, empty.\n“Another serving, if you please, Miss Solstice. It is true such sites bring increased commerce to our city, but the negative effects of so many adventurers cannot be discounted.”\nErin took Klbkch’s bowl and headed into the kitchen. She refilled it with the jar of Acid Flies and accidentally spilled some on the floor as she ladled them into the bowl. After a moment’s hesitation, Erin picked them up and tossed them in Klbkch’s bowl. She figured it probably wouldn’t bother him. The floor was clean, anyways. Flies were dirty things.\n“Okay, so this is big news. But why are they all coming here? Are these ruins that amazing?”\nRelc had pushed aside his bowl of Acid Flies for more pasta and soup. Erin caught Klbkch munching down on those as she slid him his refilled bowl of Acid Flies.\n“Well, that’s the thing. No one knows what’s in those ruins. It could be nothing, but it also could be a ton of magical artifacts and treasure. It’s that big of a dungeon, apparently. Most ruins, well, they’re already explored or too dangerous to dive further into. A new spot like this is going to bring hundreds of idiots into Liscor, and guess who gets to watch them to make sure they don’t cause trouble?”\n“You?”\n“Exactly! It’s a pain in the tail, and we’re busy enough as it is. Now’s usually the time when we hire new recruits, so we’re going to be understaffed and working overtime.”\n“It is a troublesome predicament.”\nKlbkch didn’t stop eating as he spoke, which created an odd\ncrunching\nbackground to his words, which already had a\nclicking\nnature to them.\n“Naturally, the influx of adventuring parties leads to more trouble. However, it will also bring in needed trade and many merchants who seek to do business. Thus, while guardsmen such as Relc and myself find the situation hard to manage, the city is far more positive about these findings. Also, may I trouble you for another plate?”\nErin blinked down at the empty bowl.\n“I just refilled that. You really like those flies, don’t you?”\nKlbkch nodded.\n“It is…surprising. I had not known the Acid Flies of this region were so…tasty. Until this moment, I had never attempted to consume one.”\n“Yeah, I’ve never seen you eat like that, Klb! You’re eating like one of those pigs! Or a Gnoll!”\nRelc laughed at Klbkch around a full mouth of food. Both Erin and Klbkch raised their hands to shield themselves from the splatter.\n“Well, if you like it so much, I guess I’m in business!”\nErin grinned happily.\n“I had no idea it would be such a huge hit. It almost makes everything I had to do to get these buggers worth it. Almost.”\n“Was it difficult?”\n“Very. But hey, if I’m the only one who can catch these suckers, I can actually attract some customers! Klbkch, would you mind telling some of your friends about my inn? I’d love to have some more business.”\nKlbkch visibly hesitated.\n“Do you mean for me to bring others of my kind, Miss Solstice?”\nShe shrugged.\n“Yeah. Why not? If you liked the flies so much, I’m sure your friends would love them too. I’ve got a good system for harvesting them too—make them explode\nbefore\nyou start carrying the glass jars around.”\nAgain, Klbkch hesitated.\n“I am not sure that would be too…wise.”\n“Why not?”\nRelc was silent as he slurped down the last of his pasta, but he was watching Klbkch carefully from the corner of his eye.\n“My fellow…Workers are not as used to dealing with other species as I. It would be imprudent to bother you with their presence.”\n“Hey, if they’re like you, I wouldn’t mind it. And if they don’t want to talk to me, I can just serve them more flies.”\nKlbkch looked uncomfortable.\n“I would not want to put you to any inconvenience.”\n“Isn’t that what being an innkeeper is all about? Besides, I deal with Pisces. Come on. Bring a few of your friends, and I’ll serve you Acid Flies until you explode.”\n“Yeah, what’s the worst that could happen?”\nRelc nodded. He slurped down his pasta and thumped Klbkch on the back. Jovially. Erin and Klbkch glared at him. Deliberately, Erin began knocking against the hard wood of the table.\n“Has no one here heard of Murphy’s Law?”\n“What’s that?”\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "Evening fell across the world at the same time. It was already dark in Liscor in an inn where a young woman was knocking on a table. That was because the mountains that sheltered her inn were obscuring the fading light. But far south and to the west, upon another continent, another land—the dry air was turning orange slower, blooming crimson like a great flower.\nSand whipped from the distant desert and blew across a city in ruins. A silent place. Not quiet, for men and women of both skin and cloth-flesh did live and work. Even flying folk with features and feathers like birds—but the city was still broken.\nIt resembled a crown, towers reaching high above circular walls. Once, this crown had been unbroken; now, two towers had fallen to decay.\nIt was decay that ate this city to pieces. The streets, once painted with glorious colors, filled with visitors, supplicants, and treasures from a thousand lands, were torn up. Glass windows were long since broken—or sold.\nEverywhere was echoes. If you looked up, there lay one of the largest palaces upon a hill, a structure of mighty stone—but like everything else, it, too, had waned. Inside, there were no pieces of art; the treasury was shadowed, and year by year, the servants who remained looked older and thinner, despite the best efforts of the last loyal servant to keep everyone fed.\nIt was not food nor even the fallen fortunes that kept this city, this palace so quiet and still. It was like a slumber, a dark, deep dream had fallen across this remnant of a kingdom. Their heart had stopped beating, so they waited.\nWaited—and they had been waiting for decades.\nThey knew now, all of the ones who lived here, that there might be no waking. The rest of the King’s Seven were gone; the old kingdom had fallen to pieces and been gobbled up by other powers.\nNow, they were allowed to live and stumbled through their days here despite their many enemies across the world. Because—no one dared march an army through the crumbling gates. Despite the few [Soldiers] left, the impoverished streets and folk—\nNo one wanted to wake this place up.\nOr rather, wake the true sleeper.",

    "text": "He sat in his throne room, a man with hair flowing long and unkempt. Despite the years that had added onto themselves, taking away his youth, he still had almost no grey in the red-gold hair that hung about his body. His clothes were still as rich as they had ever been, but the silk had worn fine, and cunning thread had tried to disguise tears and atrophy.\nEven magic seemed to have waned around him. This man sat thinner than he had ever been. And he had been a great warrior. He still had elements of that—but he was frail, in spirit and in body, as one who had sat in this chair for years.\nA plain chair, padded and backed with some ornate wood—but not a chair for him. It sat in a gigantic throne room, across ancient marble laid generations before his. And on the far wall was a throne meant for him. He had taken it from a foe in ages past, and the gold sparkled brighter with magic. The back of that throne was less comfortable than the chair, yet somehow, the man seemed most miserable where he sat below.\nThe only thing not tarnished or worn was his crown. A circlet of gold shaped into the very sigil of this nation. It was like a leaf of gold, sprouting from inhospitable desert, surrounded by stars.\nBut for that—and his very striking appearance—he might have been any man sitting there. For there was no spark in those eyes as green as this continent was not. They should have danced with passion, mirth and joy and fury.\nInstead, they were empty. For twenty-two years, it seemed like those eyes were pieces of glass that fixed upon objects and people with no real meaning or purpose. Searching, perhaps.\nDreaming.\nSlumbering, they called him. Slumbering…and let him sleep. Let him die there. No one disturb him, lest he wake.\nThat was how it had been for so long that no one had given any thought to this place, except as an entry in history. A calamity checked and now forgotten. The people of the city, the servants, the last protector who despaired even as he kept his vigil—all had grown used to this quiet despair.\nExcept that yesterday, something had happened. Something so unique that it had sent servants running through the palace and [Soldiers] dashing to defend the man in this room.\nAssassins.\nThat was what the people heard, and it made them worry. It made some furious—and remember blades and wrath. An [Assassin] would be the end of all—but this place was not so broken yet, not so\nworn\nthat one could kill that man so easily.\nNor would the true perpetrators long live thereafter, even if a great nation had ordered it.\n…But it was not assassins after all. It had been a mistake. What, exactly, the servants did not say, nor did the [Soldiers] understand. So the city murmured then fell silent. Waiting and waiting…but what they did not know was that the intruders were still there.\nIn that very throne room, in fact. They were alone, and the [Soldiers] at the doors occasionally glanced in to make sure they had no weapons—not that they were old or canny enough to bear them. Even the great servant, the steward, was not allowed within the throne room, to his anger. He had stormed off, but he had obeyed because it was a rare order.\nThe man in that chair had given it, so the two children were allowed to stay.\nBoy and girl. The [Soldiers] and the steward might have objected—but the man with red-gold hair was not so weak as to be done in by two child-assassins, even if they came from Germina. Nor did these two have the look.\nThey were not warriors. Their clothing, even their demeanors were soft. Terrified, in fact. They had appeared in a flash of light and sound and quailed because they might be killed—now, spared, they were talking.\nA young man and woman. Boy and girl in demeanor, but not age. They were both…sixteen years old. Neither one had the eyes of an adult having worked or fought already as men and women. They had strange dress, too colorful and beautiful to be cheap, but without an inch of magic or more marvelous thread.\nTheir accents were also—strange. They used strange words and stared about as if everything were new and odd. A common sword made their eyes pop, and a Yellat was the strangest food in the world. Perhaps they were Terandrian? No…stranger still.\nBut only the man in the throne room understood that. He listened as the two spoke, and his dreamy eyes slowly focused on one or the other.\nA boy and a girl. Twins. They looked like each other, reflected, so similar that when one fell silent, the other spoke in their place. They were mystified as to how they had come here.\nIt also made the man in the chair curious. He would break into their explanations now and then. The boy would answer, or the girl, or both falter until one had a reply.\nNone of their answers were wrong, but some created more questions. An incomprehensible tangle of questions and answers because nothing made sense.\nYet these were no lies, the man with the crown knew.\nHe could tell, even without the glowing crystal showing the truth of every statement. It just made their answers more confusing.\nHe sat there, hunched, and whispered in a low voice hoarse from lack of use.\n“Hm. And is that the entirety of your world?”\nHe sat like a man waiting for something. And though his posture was languid and relaxed, a spark shone within the depths of his emerald eyes.\nIt was the first spark of genuine curiosity in a long time. The boy hesitated, and the girl nodded. The man shifted slightly, and his royal clothes moved, revealing something.\nThe flash of steel.\nBut rather than a blade—the boy stared at the links of fine chainmail underneath the cloth.\nThe man was wearing armor despite sitting there. He wore the heavy steel like a second skin, as if he would have felt bare or uncomfortable without. When he stood, it was with swift clarity, as if he didn’t even notice the added weight.\nIf the Great Companies of Baleros could have seen him now, or the Archmages of Wistram, or the Hundred Kings and Queens of Terandria—they would have recognized a face from many burnt and defaced paintings, illustrations in history books, and descriptions of a younger man, now aged.\nYet in this moment, all their laughter and reminiscing of his fallen glories would have ceased. If they could have seen him, the look on his face would have scared them terribly. For the glass stare of a vacant figure was gone.\nIn its place was a burning hunger. A curiosity—an insatiable desire. The man’s head slowly rose, and the hair too long unsheared moved as he gazed up.\nThe ceiling of his throne room had gone to dust, despite the best efforts of the cleaners. His city below lacked color, and the deserts had reclaimed lush lands once filled with noise and light.\nHe had seen this same view for decades in grief and slumber. Now—the man looked out and saw something else.\nEvening was falling across his continent, Chandrar. He gazed into the distance where the greatest desert in the world lay, and he had seen it. He had seen the buried city to the south, glimpsed peaks of every nation on the land upon which he stood.\nEven those memories could not stir the eyes that had been emptied of tears and passion. Now, though—the man caught his breath. His great chest rose slowly as he saw something the two children could not.\nBut they had brought it. It was a vision. A vision of a world hanging in space. Space—a world shining at night with the lights of a thousand artificial suns. Green and blue and towering buildings of steel and glass. Airplanes soaring through skies with no magic but another kind of force of lightning and wit.\nThe vision held him there, breathless,\nand those eyes opened wide.\nWide.\nAnother notable thing about the man was that when he turned, his tanned skin had a hundred ancient scars. His teeth were white as he bared them, and when he\nsmiled\n, the air felt full of life, like a heart suddenly skipping a beat. The two twins gazed at him, amazed at the change in the figure.\nWhen they had first tumbled into this place and seen him sitting there, so still, head bowed, shoulders hunched, they’d feared he was dead or oblivious to all. But now he stood.\nThe last thing that was notable about this man was that he was a king.\n“Magnificent. Truly, magnificent.”\nHe exhaled and then strode away from the windows and balcony. The twins flinched, but the king made no move towards them. He strode about the great throne room, his long steps a flurry of movement in the silent emptiness.\n“A world unlike this one, full of miracles such as I have never dreamed…? Inconceivable. And yet—you tell the truth.”\nThe king spun towards the twins, and they jumped as one. He eyed the flashing stone, but his gaze was on their faces. He leaned over, inspecting their eyes and watching them—and he did know people. Again, the king shook his head.\n“You tell the truth. I know it. Not just because of a Skill, but because it is too incredible not to be the truth. I could believe a world ruled by magic, but a world ruled by—machines? A place where magic is myth and technology has advanced to the point where men fly for business and convenience? That cannot be a fairy tale.”\nHe swept past the two again, this time towards the throne. The king put one foot on the dais and then shook his head. It wasn’t time. Once again, he stalked around the room, too impatient to hold still. His body screamed protest because it was not used to action. But his mind—his heart was shouting louder. Then he spun back and pointed at the girl, who flinched again. But he was not angry.\n“And when you did lie—when you dared to conceal the truth—it was to lie about the strength of your armies! The sheer power of a single weapon in your world that could shatter armor like paper and lay waste to even the strongest walls—that is the might of the world you claim exists beyond this one! Where I would be naught but a primitive beast from a forgotten era.”\nHe spread his arms as he came to a stop before the boy and the girl. They looked up at him fearfully. Not because he had been violent, but because he was a king to be feared or exalted—or both.\n“So. What should I do with two strangers from another world? What would any man do? The thoughtless rulers who seek to protect their ways of life? Perhaps kill you.”\nThey flinched at that. The girl moved protectively in front of the boy. The king’s lips twitched.\n“Do not fear, young lady. I am no ordinary man, ruled by his flaws. I am a king, and my flaws are a lesser man’s strengths. No; I believe I should keep you two safe. You have more knowledge, I am sure, and you may be key to finding more of your kind. Nor do I fear your world. Not at all.”\nThe two twins looked up at the king nervously. They paused, and then the girl asked a question. The king nodded as he stroked his beard. It was too long, and he looked down at it, mystified, as if wondering how it had come to his chin without him noticing. He went on, feeling for his side, but it hung empty.\n“The prospect of you two being the first and only is possible. But the odds that more of you strangers have come to this planet is altogether more likely. Perhaps a portal is open and the armies of this other planet pour through already to sweep through nations like a reaper’s scythe.”\nThe thought of such devastation made the king smile. Smile and his eyes twinkle at odds with his words and the vision he saw.\n“How wonderful.”\nBy now, the twins were exchanging looks of fear, because it was clear they stood before a madman, but the king only laughed. He spread his arms wide as he faced them.\n“You do not understand. How could you? But think, for a moment, as a king would. Think as I would. Come.”\nWith one word, the King moved the twins’ unwilling feet. He strode over to one side of the room and yanked open a set of double doors. The red light of a fading sun blinded the two for a moment, but the King strode out onto the balcony.\n“There.”\nHe gestured out across his balcony at the crumbling city below. People went to work in the streets, hauling poor harvests of Yellats to stalls that contained only cheap goods. They worked, never looking up at the palace and that balcony because they did not expect to see anyone there.\nIf they had—they would have seen that man, aged, showing the two children that faded sea of roofs and streets. They could not see the parades of armies, the cheering crowds he could still hear, the seven champions gathering in laughter and glory. He spread his arms as if showing them that past, and it was at odds with the reality he knew lay before him. The irony did not escape him, so his smile was bitter.\n“Behold my empire. Once, each street was packed with people from every nation. Every storefront held goods brought from countless thousands of leagues away, and messengers sped to every corner of my expanding kingdom. By day and night my armies marched forth, and the world trembled to hear the clash of blades and my name on the lips of men.”\nThe twins looked out at the city, but couldn’t imagine the sight the king described. All they saw were crumbling bricks and ragged people walking without life. The gutters ran with filth, and what food was on display in the shops was rotten or rotting. The king gazed down upon his city and shook his head.\n“Once. But I abandoned my dreams of conquest and let the nation I had built collapse around me. And why? Because my vision was too small and my goal too achievable. I had swept through a continent and brought low countless kingdoms and yet—it was an edifice of the moment, a paltry creation born of opportunity and luck. It was worthless. One moment of grief brought it tumbling down. I was unworthy of it, for all to spring up around me.”\nThe twins stared at the dying city below them. They shuddered as they saw the malnourished faces of the people below. The king glanced down at the two.\n“You pity them?”\nBoth nodded, unguarded. Then they flinched, because they understood something of monarchs and knew it might be unwise to tell it to this man’s face. But he just nodded sadly as his smile became guilty. He gazed down, leaning on the balcony.\n“Well and good. They deserve a better ruler than I. In my regret and self-indulgent misery, I have failed my subjects. But the fire in my soul had long been extinguished. I could barely stand. Until this day.”\nHe swept back into the throne room. The twins ran after him, drawn in his wake like minnows in the tide. The king ascended the dais of his throne two steps at a time and stood, looking down at the two twins. He seemed larger all of a sudden, and this was a man already commanding by physical presence alone.\n“Once, my name echoed throughout the world! My deeds were spoken of in awe! And yet you have come here—come\nhere\n, to the heart of my fading kingdom—to tell me that a greater world exists than I had ever dreamed?”\nHis voice thundered through the throne room. The twins gripped each other in mortal fear. The king pointed at them.\n“And to be told that all I had accomplished in life—all the glories that empires dare to claim as their proud history—to be told that is nothing compared to the wonders of your world. Is that not intolerable? Yet, for all the strength of my armies, we cannot match a single—bomb. And though my [Mages] could labor a thousand years, they could not fly up to the twin moons in the sky and dare to land on them. Worse though…\nthey never even dreamed of it.\nLand on the moons!”\nHe raised his arms and roared with laughter. The cavernous room echoed with the thunder of his voice.\n“What a jest! What a challenge the heavens have sent me!”\nThe boy and the girl held each other. They had seen many things in life compared to the citizens of this world, or so they claimed. They had seen men and women flying, they had looked upon their world as a small orb of blue and green, they had witnessed armies marching on television screens and men walking upon the moon.",

    "text": "They had told him this proudly. Proudly and nervously, as if trying not to frighten him. They could not see how enraging their words were. Not the glory of it, but the caution.\nAs if he had not seen a woman fly through the air like a bolt of lightning. As if he could not order a spell cast and gaze across the world.\nTheir world was a marvelous mystery they hailed from, and they were right to be proud of it.\n—But they could not boast forever before him, the reality of that king. He beheld their home, if not fully, then in their stories of another planet where one species alone ruled. They told him of nations far more advanced and mighty than his.\nAnd he?\nHe laughed.\nThe King threw back his head, and the [Soldiers] started from their posts. The laughter ran down the hallways, and a servant looked up at a sound she thought was a dream. The man backed up, stumbling up the steps of the dais, and he leaned on a golden armrest of his throne for support.\nHis laughter beat down upon the two twins like a physical thing. He laughed at their world, not mocking—but like a man who had never seen more than a creek suddenly beholding an ocean blown by a storm. Like a man who, at the edge of the sea where it met the shore of his dry continent, found two children who told him it was greater than the desert he called his home. With conviction, pointing across that wide, green-blue expanse all without having walked a mile of the journey of countless leagues that had borne him to this place.\nThe laughter. The passion. It was like a spark growing on dry grass. The [Soldiers] had heard it. So too had the servants.\nThe [Steward] had felt it. But he had dreamed so often that he came back from training in private, still angry—but drawn to the smoke in the palace. And the king?\nHe stood there, panting with his hilarity—and realized he was standing against the throne. He looked down at the chair and hesitated. Then—\nAs if his legs had grown tired from standing this short while. As if the throne drew him down. As if the weight of that circlet suddenly grew too heavy, and his conscience bloomed with water long lost from this land.\nAll at once, the king sat down on his throne. In a moment, his mirth was gone, and the insane energy that had filled him had been replaced. The twins did not understand the meaning—not quite—but they sensed it.\nThe air changed. One second, the man was but a man, arrogant and passionate, but not quite himself. Not quite real. Then he sat—and something filled the throne room.\nIt passed through the hallways, enveloped the palace, and spread across the city. Slowly, but growing second by second. A presence, a choice made. The figure with red-gold hair now seemed to smolder on his throne, and when he stood up again, he was a different man.\nHe was a [King].\nHe spread his arms and woke. Tears shone in his eyes. Tears, for it was done. He stood and stretched, and decades fell off him slowly. When he called out, his voice was fuller, surer, and he pointed down at the two children, who only began to realize what they’d done now.\n“Come, then. Let us wake this sleeping nation and bring death and glory to this hollow world once more!”\nHe walked down from the dais and began striding across the throne room towards the double doors. The twins followed him, not daring to be left behind. The [King] called out.\n“Orthenon!”\nThe King bellowed. He stopped beside the smaller chair and planted one foot on it.\n“Orthenon! My [Steward]! Come to me!”\nFor a second, all was silence. And then the double doors opened, and a man entered the room. He was a tall, gaunt man who walked with unnatural grace across the marble floor. His hair was black and grey, for he too had aged, and he carried a long, slightly curved sword at one hip.\nHe wore black, almost like a servant of another time, but he too wore armor beneath cloth. What separated the two was that if the [King] was a man of passion, Orthenon’s own passions and personality were like a swinging blade. Precise—but the years had left rust on him as well.\nThese strange feelings in his chest, the two twins, and the familiar orders from that man had left him—unsettled. Angry. When he entered the throne room now, even his sure stride was slow—\nBut he did not see what he wanted. What he saw was the [King], foot upon that chair. While that pose should have tipped him off, he had missed the moment the man sat down on the throne.\nThat feeling was filling the air, but Orthenon’s own grief and wait were too long. All he saw was the chair, not the throne. So when he bowed, it was low, but with a cold, tired anger of an exhausted man waiting with arm raised, clinging to a cliff’s edge. Waiting, hoping, for the day that might never come.\nThat was all contained in his not-quite-glare as he approached his king.\n“You summoned me, Lord?”\nLord.\nIt was an insult borne of a despairing man. The [King] nodded; he saw it. Yet now, his eyes were dancing with anticipation. He was still smoldering from the inside, and the fire was growing, but his steward didn’t see it. Not yet.\n“Tell me, Orthenon. What is the state of my kingdom?”\nThe man made a bitter face. He had heard this question before, and again, he missed the tone. He answered, glancing at the two twins, his voice growing rough with impatience and frustration.\n“As I have told you time and again, sire, we are dying. This nation is crumbling away. Our enemies take our land, your vassals bend knee to foreign powers, and we cannot even feed our youngest.”\nThe [King] nodded. His eyes seemed to burn in the half-light. If Orthenon would look up—but he didn’t. The [Steward] continued talking, his voice slowly rising with passion as he listed the frustrations of years.\n“Better nations have risen in the ashes. The Emperor of the Sands leads his armies across the deserts even now! The other nations break their armies upon his forces as he rises in the west. Nerrhavia sits fat and indolent to the south, and Medain pushes ever southwards against Jecrass and Belchan. While our people\nstarve,\nGermina’s agents flit about, and the Quarass and Hellios test our borders. I have told you this time and time again, Lord! If you will not take the throne, why do you ask it of me?”\n“Because I am your [King].”\nOrthenon looked up. His look of rage changed to uncertainty, and his balled, gloved hand, almost curled as if to strike—suddenly became limp with disbelief.\nThen he saw it. Two green eyes, roaring with a younger man’s passion. Burning—in a face too old but a heart too young.\nTwenty-two years. It had aged the [King]—and not at all at the same time. He had been a prisoner here, a slumbering man of his own making, so it was a younger man mixed with an older one who stared down at the [Steward].\nIn that moment—Orthenon knew. The [King] stepped forwards and placed a hand on his shoulder. Just that. It trembled as his most loyal vassal looked into his eyes, and the king’s own shone with tears. And the fire spread from one man to the other.\n“Rejoice, my steward. I have returned. I sit upon my throne at last.”\nThat was all the king whispered. For a moment, the gaunt man gaped. Then his eyes filled with tears. He clasped his King’s hand, and the two embraced for a moment.\n“I had hoped—we have waited so long, Your Majesty—”\n“I know.”\nThe [King] patted Orthenon gently as the man choked on his words. But in seconds, he had mastered his weeping and bowed low to the ground, one leg extended forwards as the other swept back. One hand on his chest as the other extended outwards. It was a different gesture than the stiff bow he had given earlier. The bow one gave to a ruler.\nThe [King] nodded in approval. He lifted his foot off the chair and picked it up with one hand.\n“Never again. You have my word.”\nWith a sudden move, the King hurled the chair. It flew through the air across the room and\nshattered\non the far wall, fifty feet away. The throw was so powerful the wood pulped and the old frame became a hail of splinters. The twins gaped as wood rained down. The man exhaled, nodded, and turned back towards his steward.\n“Now then. Report, Orthenon. Tell me of my kingdom once more.”\nOrthenon spread his hands out as he faced his king. His expression was conflicted as he spoke. Starvation and the pain of years weighed him down, and yet a fire was stirring in his eyes. He did not look as he had a few moments ago—a broken, exhausted man.\nSomething was filling him up. Now—the [Steward] felt lighter, and his own back straightened, and when his eyes flickered, truly thinking, not complaining or watching stone break and age—\n—They were the eyes of a man who had seen nations burn. Who had led armies. Who stood behind the [King], at his side, and had driven armies of legend into the sea. Even so, his words were tinged with regret. Regret—and with a rising passion for what he knew would come.\n“How can I report upon chaos, sire? I could list a thousand dire issues and still have a thousand more left unspoken. The kingdom is failing. Our treasury is empty, our people are starving, our crops have failed, our animals are dead, and our armories full of rust and decay. Every decent soldier save a loyal few have fled for greener lands, and we teeter on the precipice.”\n“Wonderful.”\nOrthenon stared at his king. The twins stared at the red-haired man too. They gaped at him as if he’d gone mad. But that too was being part of a [King], and he was used to their incomprehension. Slowly, the ruler tapped his palm with his other hand.\n“We have never fallen so far before. My kingdom and I have sunk to our lowest. How wonderful. It shall make the coming days, weeks, and years all the greater. I repent it. I repent all I have done—but if there is one thing to take, Orthenon—let it be that when we amend these wrongs, let the first sip of water be sweeter, the first horn call the most passionate that all those who have waited have ever heard. I regret it—but rejoice in that, I beg you.”\nThe twins didn’t understand. But the embers began to burn, and Orthenon’s eyes flashed. The King looked out towards the balcony.\n“What of those loyal to me? What of my vassals, those I chose to lead in my absence? Have they abandoned me as well?”\n“Not abandoned, my king. But they were forced to bow or be broken by other nations. Even now, foreign armies hold your lands and impose their laws upon your people. From Sottheim to Tiqr—they are checked, suppressed, even if they would rejoice at hearing your voice.”\nThe [King] nodded. He swept towards his throne, and now the fire in him was fully lit. As he passed by the twins, they shivered uncontrollably. What was happening? The old man they had first met was gone, and in his place something fierce threatened to burn down the entire castle. The King was far larger than his mortal shell. Even his clothing seemed to be brighter than before.\n“Send word to my vassals closest to me. Tell them they have three—no, two days to dispose of the worthless dogs that would grind their pride to dust. They will rejoin me here with as many warriors and youths of worth as they can muster. Then send word—covertly—to those further abroad.”\nOrthenon hesitated.\n“I am not sure they would believe it is you, sire. And it has been so long—some might turn away.”\nThe [King] stood by his throne. He pointed down at Orthenon.\n“Then tell them this: I await them. And I shall raise my banners and set each place at my table myself. Until they have gathered here, I shall not rest upon this throne. But let the kingdom know and the world hear! I have returned!”\nOrthenon touched a trembling fist to his breast. His eyes were blurred with tears, but he didn’t look away from his king for a second.\n“Go!”\nThis time, the King’s voice was a roar. He shouted again, and it was thunder. It echoed through the throne room, out the double doors, and reverberated through the entire city. The twins thought they felt the ground trembling.\n“Let this nation wake from its two-decade-long slumber! Let every hand grab sword and axe! Stand, all those who still remember my name! Hear me and obey! Reim, hear your [King].\nRise!\n”\nThe last word shook the air. The twins leapt forwards and then stopped. They didn’t know what they were doing, only that they\nhad\nto move. The [King]’s voice seized something inside of them and struck sparks in their very souls.\nOrthenon raced out of the room. The twins heard him shouting wildly, and then it was as if wildfire fueled by madness consumed the castle. The steward’s shouting was joined by another man shouting—not in panic or fury, but with joy. It was quickly joined by more voices, men and women crying out, and the pounding of footsteps.\nThe [Soldiers] and [Servants] had known—but like Orthenon, they hadn’t believed. They had begun to gather outside of the throne room, hoping, praying—if only they had known what prayers were.\nBut then the double doors had burst open and the [Steward] had come out, running and shouting the news. That dignified man, racing forwards like a boy?\nThey knew the moment they saw him standing there, laughing and shouting. Then they were running, following Orthenon, in a huge throng from every door in the palace, throwing windows open to scream the news.\nAnd everyone who heard it, man or woman, flying bird-folk—they looked up. They felt the presence in the air, and then they were turning and screaming the news across the land.\nFrom the castle, the commotion grew and spread into the city. Open-mouthed, the twins watched as a man ran into the street, screaming and shouting wildly. The people he passed looked up, and it was as if they caught the same wild passion from him. Some fell to their knees, others wailed or shouted, and more began running throughout the city or out the gates towards other villages.\nNot a single person who heard the wild shouting was spared. The fire raged and spread to every soul in the kingdom. A dull roar of sound rose from the city and every part of the castle. It was deafening, wild; rejoicing mixed with relief and sadness and hope.\nIt was the sound of a city coming back to life. The din was so great, it reached across the kingdom in hours. From there, it spread to disbelieving ears, people who refused to hear the truth—but the echoes froze the hearts of the [King]’s enemies. It began to ring across the entire world.\nThe [King] strode out onto his balcony, and the people shouted, and the sound grew louder as they saw his face. He raised one hand, and the twins were nearly deafened by the noise.\nHe turned towards them. The light was fading, and the sun had nearly set. But the King glowed, and it may have been a trick of the lights or their imaginations, but the twins could swear the light formed a halo above his head. Or…not a halo.\nA crown.\nThe man pointed at the twins, still surrounded by an aura of his very class.\n“I have much to do. But you two. I will have you accompany me. You shall be my personal attendants. Bodyguards? Yes, bodyguards. I will properly train you to your role in the coming days.”\nThe twins gaped. They began to protest, but the King laughed. He listened to the boy speak, then the girl, and shook his head.\n“Hah! It matters not what you wish. Your lives belong with me. You have awoken me—and for better or worse, our destinies are joined.”\nHe meshed his fingers together, looking so amused. For they did not know what they’d done, not truly. Again, they argued, but their words trailed off as they stood before the king. He looked down at them, surrounded by the dying glow of a sun and lit by an inner fire.\n“These things you speak of. Freedom…? Liberty?\nJustice?\nPah. They are not yours by right. If you would claim yourself, take arms against me. For I hold all these things.”\nHe gestured towards the city stirring into life.\n“Know this: wheresoever I walk and so far as my reach extends, I claim this world and yours as my own. So long as you are within my grasp, I shall rule you. For I am…”",

He listened to the sound and murmured.\n“Let the world take arms against me. Let the peoples of every race march upon my people, and let the earth itself open and the pits of hell and the Demons of Rhir spew forth. I care not. I welcome the coming strife! I am a king, and all those who would follow me are my people. I will not be stopped. The world is mine! Both worlds!”\nThe King spread his arms wide and laughed. The fire left the city and raced out across the countryside, spreading from person to person, bringing with it a single message. It echoed from every hill, in every street, and every heart. He shouted it from his crumbling castle at the heavens, and the word of it spread to every corner of the world.\n“\nI am Flos Reimarch, The King of Destruction. Let the world know I have returned!\n”\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "The Hive was always dark. Always secluded from the light of the surface above. Even in the grandest chamber, where the two spoke—it was so dim as to disconcert every species but theirs.\nNeither one minded. They had lived underground for ages before ever bothering to reach the surface. In the subterranean passages and the criss-crossing tunnels of the Hive of the Antinium in Liscor, two beings spoke.\nOne of them was female. The other was male. Klbkch. The female shifted, and in the darkness, her deep voice rumbled through the air.\n“Do I understand you correctly, Klbkch? Do you truly believe sending Workers above is wise? If they become Aberration all together, Liscor’s Council will not remain silent. Have you confidence in this venture?”\nHer voice was deep, and she spoke with more than mundane words. She was tired, so tired that even as she reclined, supine, her voice wearied, she seemed ready to fall asleep. Yet there was a core of will that never left her.\nSometimes, he thought she was the stronger of the two of them, for all she did not leave this place and labored endlessly. But then—\nHe was older. Older and wearier by far. Klbkch shook his head. He patiently tried to explain the necessity to her, and he could not articulate it even to himself.\n“No, my Queen. I merely request that a few of the Workers—perhaps ten or twenty—may be allowed to leave the city in my care. They would visit a local inn for several hours before returning.”\n“Interesting. So you have faith this venture may be rewarded?”\nThe word rolled outwards, rich, darkly velvet with hidden connotation and meaning. The Queen paused, and Klbkch hesitated.\n“I regret that this is not my initiative, my Queen. She—the innkeeper of which I spoke—she requested it of me. I am merely representing our Hive in a unique opportunity. Not necessarily one I have faith in for the success we hope for.”\n“Ah. I see.”\nSurprise flicked through the female’s deep voice as it echoed in the cavernous chamber. Surprise and regret. But then she latched onto something else that was fascinating.\n“This Human did? What species would desire the presence of Workers if not to work?”\nThat was what made Klbkch so interested himself. He lifted an antenna, like one lifted a finger.\n“She did not ask for the Workers specifically. Rather, she was inclined to sell foodstuffs to our people. Acid Flies. She wishes to earn money by gaining our business.”\n“And this Human is genuine? She does not fear the Antinium?”\n“To the best of my knowledge and ability, I believe her so. Nor does she fear us, my Queen. It is as if she has no past with nor knowledge of the Black Tide.”\nAgain, surprise was the primary emotion in the female’s voice.\n“And you think her worth spending your time and the Hive’s effort upon, even risking an Aberration.”\nKlbkch hesitated. He bowed his head in the direction of the female.\n“Her name is Erin Solstice, my Queen. And I believe—yes, I believe the experience may help further our plan in some small way. At the very least, it would help increase her trust of our kind. A rare opportunity.”\n“And why should I entertain her request?”\nNow she sounded petty. Tired and petty, for she saw no value in this. And he could not fault her, but Klbkch spread his hands outward. They were humanoid hands, at least in that they resembled them more than an insect’s feelers. The same could not be said of the appendages of the Queen.\n“My Queen, do we no longer seek to improve relations with other species? Is this not why Liscor’s Hive was founded at such great effort? Drakes are one species; Humans would be a rare boon, even if she was but one representative predisposed to look kindly on us.”\nThe female moved in the darkness. Her voice changed, hissing softly in regret and frustration. She\nclicked\nin her distress.\n“The plan has not changed, Klbkch. But we have. And not in the ways that we desire. I am weary, and you—ten years. No; the change comes from the others. The Grand Queen speaks. The other Queens once again question our lack of success.”\nKlbkch looked up. His hands moved unconsciously to the twin swords at his waist. Not that he would bear blades against them. It was a sign of his emotions, a rare display.\n“…Are any of their objections backed by orders? Have Xrn or Wrymvr made any objections of their own known?”\nShe waved a languid feeler at him.\n“Not as such. Calm yourself, my Prognugator. My authority is undiminished, such as it is. And yet. The Queens move, Klbkch. They are waiting for an opening, and they would sacrifice us if they saw a chance to strike.”\nThe male Antinium looked up sharply. The antennae on his head twitched.\n“Is that the position of the Grand Queen? If I may offer my counsel, that would be…unwise. The Hives are not ready.”\nShe nodded in the blackness.\n“Yes. But they grow impatient with time. The Grand Queen speaks more than she acts. However, she is correct. We cannot continue this endeavor for nothing to show for it. Ten years. They speak of recalling us, idly for now. But they do speak. That is why I will allow this risk. Take twelve Workers. Let them visit this Solstice child. It may harm, but we have been a decade of failure.”\nHer head bowed. Klbkch knelt on one segmented knee.\n“Thank you, my Queen. I will not betray your trust in me.”\nA great sigh echoed through the room, shifting Klbkch’s antennae as the air moved.\n“Of that, I have no doubt. But I need more than your loyalty. Klbkchhezeim of the Centenium. I must have success. Can you promise me that?”\nHer voice was so longing. Despair rang in every tone. Ten years, and ten years of failure for the Free Antinium and their Hive, despite their lofty boasts when they left. Klbkch felt it too. He was still as he knelt before her. Then Klbkch looked up and shook his head slowly.\n“I cannot. But I will try.”\n“Very well. Try, then.”\nKlbkch nodded. He stood and began to stride out of the room with quick, light movements.\n“Klbkch.”\nHe turned. In the darkness, a large feeler pointed at him, and a titanic shape moved. A weary voice spoke.\n“Something must be done in the next few years. Some—tangible success. Or I will accede to the will of the others and pursue another project in the Hivelands.”\nFor a second, Klbkch froze. If she said that, she who had opposed the other five to do this? She who believed in everything? He looked at the Queen and bowed his head.\nShe was giving up, and he could not blame her.\n“I will ensure that all goes well, my Queen. Erin Solstice is not hostile to our kind. I believe she will be a positive influence for them.”\n“Then go. But there is one more thing I ask of you.”\n“Yes, my Queen?”\nThe weary head rose, and the exhausted Antinium latched onto something Klbkch had mentioned. A loud\nclack\nas she moved her mandibles.\n“Ahem. These flies…how do they taste?”\n“I shall bring you a sample, my Queen.”\n“Good.”",

    "text": "Erin was making a list.\n“Okay, do I have everything? Let’s go over it again. Larder? Stocked. Check! Silverware? Lots of it, even if it’s not silver. Check!”\nShe turned and bustled over to another table.\n“Blue fruit juice? Check. Four full pitchers and a basket of blue fruits.”\nShe’d stripped several trees in preparation for tonight. At this point, she’d eaten nearly half of the fruit in the orchard. Sooner or later, she’d run out of blue fruit, which might be a problem. How long did it take for the trees to grow new fruit? Maybe Pisces would know.\n“Acid Flies? Check. Dead? Double check.”\nIt was almost sad how easily she caught them in her floating jar traps. Almost. Erin made sure they’d all exploded before she rolled them onto the grass. She thought the flat fish in the water were helping—they kept bumping into the jars, trying to eat the flies. She supposed that they might one day break the thick glass.\n“Great. Bathe upstream from the glass jars from now on.”\nShe should also probably put warning signs up. Whom they might be warning, Erin had no idea. A certain Human necromancer stayed well away from the glass jars, and she wasn’t sure if Goblins could read. Either way, her list continued.\n“Pasta? Wait, I don’t need any pasta.”\nUnless Relc dropped by. But from what the Drake told her, he didn’t like Antinium besides Klbkch, so that was an outside chance. Erin put a pot on the stove anyways. She could always eat it.\nThe lovely thing about being near a city was that you didn’t have to make your own pasta. Instead, you could just buy it from an odd Gnoll-lady who knew exactly when you were on your period. In other words, there were advantages and disadvantages to living near a city.\n“Okay. That’s about it. I’ve got bread in case Pisces comes by, and I even have cheese. Lovely, smelly cheese. Possibly from cows. And I just bet Klbkch is lactose intolerant too.”\nHer larder was fully stocked, her plates and cups were clean, and she’d even gotten out the chess board and set it up. She thought Klbkch might be up for a game or two—that was, if she wasn’t busy feeding flies to her customers.\nFor a moment, Erin had to put her head against a wall and wonder how she’d gotten to this point in her life. A girl from Michigan should\nnot\nthink it was normal to sell dead fly torsos to walking ant-people for silver coins. She was also probably ripping them off, but Klbkch seemed willing to pay whatever it took for the flies. He’d eaten\nsix\nbowls before he’d walked out.\nNow all Erin had to do was wait until Klbkch came by with his promised friends. He said they’d come by as soon as they finished with their work. Were they all guardsmen? Erin had forgotten to ask.\nSomeone knocked on the inn’s door. Erin turned and opened the door with a big smile.\n“Hi Klb—oh.”\nThe group of Goblins all took a nervous step back as Erin stared down at them. The eight—no, nine of them clustered together and shoved at their leader, a small Goblin wearing rags. Erin remembered.\n“It’s—it’s you. Do you, um, want something?”\nThe ragged Goblin awkwardly thrust out a hand at Erin. She blinked down at the pile of dirty copper and silver coins in the small palm.\n“Oh. Oh! You want to eat, right?”\nThe Goblin nodded stiffly. Erin opened the door and gestured inside.\n“Right then, come in.”\nThe ragged Goblin hesitated. It thrust the coins at her once more.\nErin recognized the raggedy Goblin as the one she’d met first, and the others were new—maybe two were of the original four she’d found?\nBut this Goblin, the small one, Erin knew. So she smiled.\n“Hey, Rags. How’s it going?”\nThat was her nickname for the Goblin who had the most tattered clothing. Her companions fidgeted behind Rags and glanced around. They seemed nervous, as if not certain this was wise, but Erin went on, voice calm.\n“Do you want something in particular?”\nThe Goblin stared at Erin’s menu and then shook her head urgently. She thrust the coins forwards, and Erin let her pour them into her palms. Once again, another day of silence, so Erin filled it.\n“How about I take the money, and I’ll feed you until it runs out, okay?”\nAgain, Erin received a blank look, but Rags seemed relieved when she took the money. Erin gingerly put the filthy pile of coins on the inn’s bar counter and wished she had hot water to go with the soap.\n“Okay. Right. This isn’t the\nbest\ntime, but why don’t you have a seat over here with your friends?”\nThe Goblins meekly wandered over to the table Erin was pointing at and sat down. She hesitated. What next?\n“Right, food.”\nAll nine heads shot up, and the Goblins stared at Erin. The ones she’d fed before were already drooling onto the table. It was the little Goblin, the Rags one, who watched Erin sharply as she hurried around.\n“Give me five—ten minutes, and I’ll have all you can eat. I just need to put on another pot. And make some soup. But I’ve got bread!”\nErin turned. Okay, she’d stuff their faces quickly. She dashed into the kitchen and reemerged with a loaf of fresh bread she’d bought and some cheese and sausage. The Goblins stared hungrily as Erin began dumping plates in front of them. They flinched back from her, though, and when she handed them a fork, they ducked down as if they thought she were going to stab them with it.\n“You can eat this while I get more food, okay?”\nThe Goblins stared at the food. Rags cautiously reached for the bread, and Erin grabbed her hand. All the Goblins flinched as one, and Rags recoiled, eyes wide, but Erin was staring at the filthy claws.\n“Oh, er. Sorry about that. I’ll slice it up for you. I have water and soap. Here—”\nConfused, the Goblins watched Erin dart into the kitchen again. They eyed the wonderful-smelling bread, meat, and strange yellow thing, and wondered if they could eat it. Then they looked up and\nscreamed\nas Erin walked back into the room with a kitchen knife and a bucket.\n“Oh no, don’t run! I’m not going to hurt you!”\nErin waved her hands frantically and nearly poked herself with the knife. The Goblins halted in their mad rush out the door. Erin put the bucket on another table and took a bar of soap and the dustrag out of her pocket.\n“I’m just going to cut this food for you. See? And this is to wash your hands.\nWash your hands.\nBecause they’re gross.”\nShe slowly and carefully went over to the food and sliced it up into smaller pieces. Erin smiled at the Goblins as they suspiciously moved back to the table. Rags was eying Erin with deep, deep distrust for the knife. But she was also eying the water and soap with clear confusion. Erin stepped back.\n“And now I’ll put the knife away. No more pointy thing. You don’t have to worry; you’ll be safe here. Okay? But wash your hands. It’s unhygienic.”\nShe gave them another reassuring smile. That was the precise moment when Klbkch entered the inn, followed closely by a group of Antinium. Erin’s smile froze on her lips.\nKlbkch froze too, and the other tall, identical brown and black insects behind him instantly halted in their tracks. The Goblins were petrified in their seats, but half immediately began edging towards the nearest window.\nErin waved frantically at Klbkch. Then she turned towards the Goblins and gave them another reassuring smile.\n“Don’t worry! Don’t worry. These people aren’t here to hurt you. They’re guests. They’re going to eat too, understand?”\nThey hesitated, but Rags seemed to be made of sterner stuff than her larger comrades. She returned to her seat. And it was a she, Erin was sure of it. The other Goblins—all but one of whom were boys—didn’t wear anything on their upper torso. They barely wore anything to cover their privates.\nShe shepherded them back to their seats and tried not to look at Goblin nether regions as their loincloths shifted in unfortunate ways. There was a reason pants were invented.\n“Go ahead and eat as much as you want.”\nAgain, the Goblins glanced nervously at the Antinium, but now that the initial scare was over, the fresh food called to them. There was a moment’s hesitation, then Rags grabbed a piece of sausage, and the Goblins began gobbling all the food on the table with their hands.\nShe winced at the mess, but at least they were occupied. Erin edged back to Klbkch, who was still waiting with his group of Antinium.\n“Hi, Klbkch. Sorry about the confusion. I had a few visitors pop by unexpectedly.”\n“There is no problem, Miss Solstice. I have brought others of my kind as you requested.”\nKlbkch nodded to Erin and gestured to the silent Antinium behind him. Erin eyed her new guests somewhat apprehensively.\nThey were like Klbkch and not like him at the same time. They\nwere\nlike each other though. Erin couldn’t tell one from the other, and all twelve of these other Antinium stood and moved like one unit.\nWhat made her stare was that they were identical to Klbkch. They had the same brown carapace and waving antennae. Four arms, beetle shell—but you could say that of Humans.\nWhat was meant by identical was\nexactly the same.\nUnlike a Human, who had a world of variation in hair and lips, even of the same color, the Antinium were carbon copies of one another.\nOnly Klbkch stood out because of his swords at his waist and armor and belt. The other Workers silently lined up, standing in two neat rows. And they also seemed disinclined to talk. Each one of the Antinium stared at Klbkch rather than look at Erin.\n“Are they—are they your friends? Or other guardsmen?”\nKlbkch shook his head.\n“I am afraid you are under a misapprehension. These are Workers, Miss Solstice. They are not fellow guardsmen—rather, they perform tasks within the Antinium section of the city. I took them because you wished for more customers, but I have not interacted with them before.”\n“Oh. So they’re not your friends?”\nKlbkch opened and closed his mandibles a few times. He turned around and stared at the Workers before turning to Erin. He clacked his mandibles a few times, and then, to her astonishment, made a laughing sound.\n“Ha. Hahahaha. That is a good joke, Miss Erin. No, these are Workers. They will behave themselves under my supervision.”\nShe was so surprised that she made no response, which Klbkch took as encouragement. He turned towards the standing group of Worker Antinium and pointed to a few of the tables.\n“You have entered an inn. The polite protocol is to introduce oneself and then take a seat. I will handle your greetings. Move to those tables.”\nThey obediently walked over to each table. At first, they all crowded around one, but Klbkch impatiently directed them so the Antinium stood four to a table.\n“Sit!”\nKlbkch snapped at the other Antinium. They instantly sat in the chairs. Erin’s smile slipped even further as Klbkch began ordering them about with curt, clipped commands.\nHe treated the other Antinium like—well, like sheep. Or…like children. Idiotic children you couldn’t trust to pick up a fork without stabbing themselves in the eye. Yes, that was it.\nErin watched Klbkch out of the corner of her eyes as he lectured the other ‘Workers.’ He was telling them how to use a spoon. And how to drink from a cup. And how to request another bowl of flies.\nFlies. They stared at the black insects, and even the Goblins looked confused, if not horrified by the loaded bowls. Black insects, dead and staring and\nicky\n, but Erin brought them out.\n“Um, thanks, Klbkch. Did you want me to get the food now? I’ve got the Acid Flies of course, but I also have pasta—”\nErin’s eyes widened.\n“Oh no! The pasta!”\nThe Goblins and Antinium watched as Erin dashed into the kitchen to salvage the over-boiled noodles. She came out a few minutes later holding plates of pasta with chopped bits of sausage and onion, which she placed in front of the Goblins.\n“Use forks. Got it? Your friend here knows how to use forks.”\nErin pointed at the silverware and then started bringing out bowl after bowl of the Acid Flies she’d prepared. She set them down in front of the Antinium Workers awkwardly. They moved out of her way, but didn’t say anything.\nThat was, until Klbkch snapped at them, and then all twelve murmured ‘thank you’ every time Erin brought out a plate and cups.\nThey could speak! Their voices sounded like Klbkch’s—but flat. Lacking intonation or emotion. And that was the only thing they ever said. They moved when spoken to and did whatever Klbkch said—beyond that, they just waited, as if they were robots expecting input. Yet they were people, right?\nSo was this an awkward moment? Yes. Erin was redefining the word for herself at the moment.\nHowever, she placed all the bowls in front of the twelve Workers, and the Antinium finally began to eat on Klbkch’s command. At least there they appeared to be somewhat enthusiastic, because they began gobbling the Acid Flies down with commendable speed, shoveling them past their mandibles with a spoon and crunching the insects up. But for that, they ate in silence, which was also unnerving. At least they were eating.\nErin breathed a sigh of relief. And the door to the inn swung open.\nA familiar Drake poked his head into the room. He immediately launched into what sounded like a prepared speech as he awkwardly held a chess set in front of him.\n“Good evening, Miss Erin Solstice! I hope you don’t mind me dropping by, but I was wondering if you’d like to play a game of ch—”\nOlesm paused and stared around the silent room. His jaw dropped as he saw the Goblins. When he saw Klbkch and the other Antinium, it dropped further. He slowly put one clawed hand on the door.\n“…Is this a bad time?”",

    "text": "Erin had gone to funerals. Well, she’d attended a funeral. And while they were solemn, sad occasions, she could rightly say that she’d visited funerals that were noisier than her inn at the moment.\nAt least funerals had coughing people, the occasional sniffling, fidgeting children, and crying babies. In the Wandering Inn, all Erin could hear was the mastication of Goblins as they gobbled their food or the quiet\ncracking\nas the Antinium chewed down their Acid Flies and clicked their mandibles together.\nChomp. Chomp. Click. Chomp.\nErin stared from the Antinium to the Goblins with a desperately cheerful smile plastered on her face. Neither side looked at the other directly, but she had the distinct impression they were silently sizing each other up. The Goblins to run away, the Antinium…well, they were just looking.\nThe atmosphere was so tense you could—well, Erin was pretty sure pulling a knife out would be a disaster. The Goblins were nervously eying the Antinium, and the Antinium were frighteningly silent and uniform. They ate and moved in almost perfect synchronization.\nErin circulated the room, pitcher of fruit juice in hand. She filled cups, took away plates and refilled them with food, and instructed Goblins\nnot\nto pick their noses. It felt like being a waitress for an entire restaurant by herself, but Erin was up to the challenge. At least, she hoped she was.\nShe wasn’t taking orders or cleaning up plates yet. All she was really doing was making sure there was food in front of her guests. The Goblins were easy. They ate anything she put in front of them. They were also terrified of Klbkch, the Antinium, Olesm, and Erin.\nOnly the one with ragged clothing, the tiny one, seemed brave enough to inspect the soap after Erin made them wash their hands. She kept peering around, surreptitiously, then springing to attention and pretending to be eating. Then Erin would catch her peeking at the menu and moving her lips, as if trying to read it.\nBut the Workers? They were hard. Erin had to make sure none of them had empty bowls or cups or they’d just stop eating. They didn’t even ask for refills by themselves.\nIn a lull between serving, Erin stopped in front of Klbkch and Olesm’s table. The two were talking quietly together, which made them exceptionally noisy in the dead silence.\n“How’re you two boys doing?”\nBoth Olesm and Klbkch looked at each other to make sure they were the ones Erin was talking to. Olesm gave her a weak smile.\n“I’m quite well, Miss Solstice. Or—may I call you Erin?”\n“\nPlease.\nI’m getting sick of being called Miss Solstice. I feel like my mom.”\n“My deepest apologies. I was not aware this was an insult to your culture.”\nKlbkch bowed his head, which made Erin feel guilty. She just meant her mom…\nHer mom.\nErin’s heart and mind twinged, and she changed the subject fast.\n“Are you two enjoying your meal? Anything I can get you?”\n“Another glass of the blue juice perhaps?”\nOlesm raised his glass, and Erin topped it off. He smiled at her.\n“It is quite tasty.”\n“Thanks.”\nThey both paused awkwardly. They were just as bad as the Goblins and Workers! Olesm glanced around the inn and fidgeted.\n“Do you—do you always serve Goblins in your inn? I saw the sign, but I must admit, this is the first time I’ve ever seen a Goblin not trying to stab someone or running away. They’re monsters, you know.”\nHe tried to whisper it, but in the silent inn, his voice carried. As one, the Goblins stopped eating and stared over at Olesm. He flinched. Yet he gave Erin a look as if she had just invited hyenas into her inn. She gave him a level stare and decided to start with the basics.\n“Um, no. They’re new here too.”\n“Oh, I see.”\nMore silence. Erin glanced down at the table. The Drake Tactician had brought along his chess board, and although he’d set it aside for the food, she saw him glancing at it now and then. To break the ice, and because she thought she might die of awkwardness, Erin did the only thing that came to mind. The most obvious thing—at least, to her.\n“How about a game of chess? Anyone want to play?”\nKlbkch and Olesm looked up.\n“Oh, I would love to play—”\nOlesm caught himself. He glanced around guiltily at the other diners.\n“But I wouldn’t want to take you away from your work. Perhaps another time.”\nHe looked so downcast that Erin wanted to pat him on the head. She thought for a second and then smiled.\n“Oh, don’t worry. We can still make it work. I’ll play you\nand\nserve food.”\nBoth Klbkch and Olesm eyed her incredulously. Erin grinned.\n“I don’t suppose either of you are familiar with chess notation?”",

    "text": "Two minutes later, the most interesting thing was happening. Workers and Goblins watched as Erin stood with her back to the chess board. It was all set up.\nBoth the littlest Goblin and the Worker who swept were here. It was pure coincidence that Klbkch had ordered the same group of Workers who had dug out the door to come to the inn—or perhaps he had simply found it easiest to take them out since they had no assignments yet.\nAs for the littlest Goblin, she’d brought a bunch of other Goblins to show them that the one who had killed the Chieftain was not…not…\nShe had brought them here to\nsee.\nMany hated the Human. But she fed them. She was…more than the death of the Chieftain and two Goblins, and because the littlest Goblin said it, some listened.\nNot all. Even the littlest Goblin didn’t know if the Human was good—she hung out with the Ant monsters! The most terrifying deaths who came from below if you went to the wrong places. And she kept calling the littlest Goblin a stupid name.\n‘Rags.’ What did that mean? Yet the littlest Goblin watched avidly because she was as curious as the listening Workers. The Workers did not understand this inn. The rules were unknown to them and Klbkch kept correcting them. They were terrified of doing something wrong and becoming Aberrations, but now they heard something fascinating. Something…with clear rules that made\nsense.\nIntriguing. The [Innkeeper] was speaking to Olesm, who was fiddling with the chess board, and she was giving instructions to him and Klbkch, but also the inn at large.\n“Okay, so you’ve moved your pawn up two spots. That’s E4, so just tell me you’re moving a pawn to E4, got it? And when I want to move, I’ll let you know by saying, oh, pawn to D5.”\nOlesm nodded and glanced down at the chess board. He carefully moved the black pawn up two spots and looked up at Erin. She nodded.\n“Got it?”\n“I believe so, Erin.”\n“Right. Let’s play!”\nErin spun away from Olesm and grabbed a cup and filled it. Across the room, Klbkch and Olesm bent over the chess board and conferred. Olesm moved a piece.\n“Pawn, ah, Pawn to F3, Erin.”\n“Got it! Knight to C6!”\nErin concentrated on the game as she walked around the inn. She wasn’t conscious of how the Goblins slowed in their eating and the Antinium Workers paused from their meal to follow her around the room. Erin’s thoughts focused, and as she mechanically took plates and filled them with food, her mind focused on only one thing.\nThe game. Some called golf the greatest game ever played. They might be right. But Erin loved chess.\nShe could even play it in her head.",

Then—then Pawn to G3?”\nAgain, Erin replied almost before he’d finished speaking.\n“Bishop takes Pawn at G3!”\n“Pawn takes Bishop at G3.”\n“And I’ll take your Rook at H1.”\nErin grinned to herself as Olesm\nhissed\nin distress. In her mind’s eye, she saw her queen piece sitting in the corner of Olesm’s side of the board, nestling right up against all of his lovely, undefended pieces.\nThe game continued, but only as mop-up. Erin happily munched away at Olesm’s pieces with her queen. He eventually managed to take hers out with his own, but only after he’d lost another knight and a bishop. By then, Erin had more pieces than he did on the board and in better positions, too.\n“I concede.”\nOlesm tipped over his king and stared despondently at the board. Erin paused serving sliced up sausage to the Goblins long enough to see Klbkch pat Olesm on the shoulder consolingly.\n“It was a good game.”\nThe Drake shook his head.\n“You do me too much credit. I made several errors that cost me many pieces. But I believe you had me from the start. Without looking at the board once! Would you do the kindness of showing me where I made mistakes?”\nHe seemed shaken, but Erin was delighted to play the game. Much less in her head! She felt like a kid again, and she used to do this all the time in the school bus or when she was bored. These days, you could do everything on a phone, but…she beamed happily, as only someone who loved the game could.\n“Of course.”\nErin walked over to the table. She rearranged the board until it was back to normal and then moved Olesm’s pawn up two spaces.\n“You started out with a classic: the King’s Pawn Opening. That was a good move.”\nOlesm looked blankly down at the board.\n“I just moved my pawn to E4. Was that truly a noteworthy move to have a strategy named after it?”\nErin nodded happily.\n“Oh, it’s a classic. Did you know almost a quarter of all chess games start with it? It’s great for taking the center spaces, but unfortunately for you, I love playing against that move.”\nKlbkch raised one hand.\n“Do you mean to say that there are established counters to this opening? And that this move is a chronicled…strategy? I had not heard of that.”\nNeither had Olesm, but Erin was too enthusiastic to notice Klbkch’s cautionary tone or Olesm’s confounded one. She nodded and pushed a black pawn forwards.\n“Oh, there are lots of good strategies. I countered with an old favorite—the Sicilian Defense. It’s great against the King’s Pawn, but you made a mistake when you moved that pawn up to F3. It doesn’t open up your side for many pieces to get out, and you really want a knight to put pressure on my side of the board. Of course, you could try to take my pawn, but that leaves your center open. Most players try to push forwards aggressively, but that’s why the Sicilian Defense works so well since it means you have to lose a pawn if you want to push into the other side.”\nErin paused and looked around the inn. Olesm was wearing a half-glazed, half-delighted expression on his face. The Goblins and all the Antinium, including Klbkch, were staring at her, open-mouthed.\n“Uh, sorry. I tend to lecture when I get too into chess.”\n“No—don’t worry in the slightest, Miss Erin.”\nOlesm shook his head and smiled at her. His eyes were alive with interest, and she noticed his tail wagging like a dog’s on the ground.\n“You have such a deep understanding of this game! How is it that you know so much about chess? I only heard about it when someone told me the Titan was playing it a few years ago, yet you say there are\nstrategies\nalready in place?”\n“Yes?”\nErin crossed her fingers as Olesm shook his head. Klbkch clacked his mandibles.\n“…I believe there are players of this game on every continent, Olesm. We appear to be in the presence of a master.”\n“Indeed, indeed! I suppose it’s arrogance to think that I knew everything. Why, they might be doing this in a Walled City like Pallass…and you’re kind enough to keep me from looking like some back-country rube. Thank you, Miss Solstice.”\nErin nodded at Klbkch in relief, and he twitched a mandible at her. She really hoped she wouldn’t have to explain being from another world. Erin glanced at Klbkch and wondered if she should play him next. Then she looked at Olesm and Klbkch together and had an idea.\nShe grinned wickedly.\n“Yeah, I love playing chess. In fact, I’ll play both of you at the same time, if you want. We have two boards, after all.”\nOlesm and Klbkch shared a glance. Both frowned slightly. Well, Olesm frowned and Erin had the distinct impression that Klbkch was frowning.\n“Aren’t you taking us a bit too lightly, Erin?”\nShe blinked innocently at Olesm.\n“Me? Of course not. But I bet I can play both of you while serving drinks and food and win against at least one. Want to test my theory?”\nThey did. Erin grinned to herself as both Olesm and Klbkch set up their pieces on opposite sides of the room. Each player stared intently at their board. She could practically feel the intensity coming off of each. It reminded her of the adults she used to play as a kid. No one liked being trash-talked by a middle schooler. It was hard for her to keep a straight face.\nKlbkch moved first. Erin stared at his board and then decided to move a piece on Olesm’s board while she thought. She circulated the room, filling up the glasses with what little fruit juice she had left. When Olesm made his move, Erin decided to hit Klbkch with a knight. And then she went back into the kitchen for more pasta. Those Goblins could\neat\n.\nThe games continued as Erin filled up bowls with the dead flies and handed them out to the Workers. They happily chomped down the flies, but she had the distinct impression they were watching as she travelled back and forth between Klbkch and Olesm’s boards.\nOccasionally, Erin would wait while one of the other two players moved a piece, but when she did move from board to board, she attacked fast, seemingly without pausing to think. She could see Klbkch and Olesm watching her as much as the board, but she effortlessly continued playing both players while serving her guests.\nHer audience watched the dual games intently. Erin kept an eye on them as well and saw both Rags and the Antinium Workers staring hard at Klbkch and Olesm’s pieces. The Goblin’s eyes narrowed, and the Antinium appeared confused. Erin smiled to herself, but kept sweeping around the room, refilling cups and swiftly moving pieces on each board.\nEventually, the game ended with a win for Klbkch and a loss for Olesm.\n“Congratulations, Klbkch. And to you, Erin.”\n“Indeed. I am quite impressed by your ability.”\nErin smiled at both players and tried not to laugh.\n“Yeah, it was a good game. Too bad I wasn’t playing either of you.”\n“What?”\nShe pointed down to the chess board in front of Olesm. His King was cornered by a queen and a bishop.\n“Notice anything similar about Klbkch’s board, Olesm?”\nHe looked over. On Klbkch’s side, he’d cornered Erin’s king with a bishop and a queen. In the exact same spots as the pieces on Olesm’s board.\n“What is this?”\n“I played you two against each other. It’s the oldest trick in the book—I once heard of a guy who tried it against two Grandmasters and failed. I always wanted to do it just once.”\nErin smiled as Klbkch and Olesm exclaimed and then raised her hands as they immediately demanded another match. She was setting up the boards for a real dual game when something happened.\nOne of the Workers stood up.\nInstantly, Klbkch stopped setting up his pieces and let one of his hands fall down to his side. Erin saw he was holding his sword hilt as he stood up.\n“What are you doing, Worker?”\nKlbkch’s voice was cold and hostile. The Worker froze in pure terror, or so it seemed—then meekly bowed to him. And then? He opened his mandibles and\nspoke.\n“This one would watch, Prognugator.”\nHis statement confounded Erin, who hadn’t thought the Workers had any desires, and Klbkch himself. The [Guardsman] replied slowly.\n“…Watch?”\nKlbkch glanced down at the board and then back to the Worker. He seemed uncertain.\n“It is impolite to intrude or impede the innkeeper’s path.”\nErin hastily interposed herself between Klbkch and the meek Worker who was already retreating back to his seat. She beckoned him over.\n“It doesn’t bother me, Klbkch. Let him watch. An audience for a chess game is great.”\nKlbkch hesitated.\n“I would not wish to impose on your hospitality or patience—”\n“Impose away, by all means!”\nErin rode over his protests and pulled up another chair. She steered the Worker over to the chair without touching him and made him sit down. Then she noticed the other Workers and Goblins were staring at the chess boards too.\n“Come on over if you want to watch, all of you.”\nInstantly, there was a crowd surrounding both chess boards. Olesm and Klbkch blinked at the spectators, but Erin smiled happily.\n“Okay, now let’s do this so it’ll be fun for me and you. I’ll play you both, but we only get five—okay, ten seconds for each move.”\n“Is this another way of playing chess?”\n“It’s how some games are played, yeah. This style is called Lightning Chess, but in tournaments, you can have anywhere from an hour’s time in total to think of all your moves to only three minutes. If we had a clock we could—never mind, I’ll explain it as we play, okay?”\nKlbkch and Olesm nodded. Erin took a chair and placed it between both tables so she could reach both chess boards.\n“I’ll have to sit down for this. I’m no Grandmaster.”",

    "text": "The first two rounds of games, Erin won handily. But in the third game, Olesm scored a draw. Klbkch nodded as he saw the blue Drake raise his claws and open his mouth with joy.\n“Congratulations, Olesm.”\nErin covered a yawn and massaged at her back. She gave the elated Drake a weary smile.\n“Yeah, that was a great game!”\n“Why, thank you.”\nOlesm’s scales turned a light shade of red as he shook Klbkch’s hand. His tail thrashed around wildly on the floor, but Klbkch and Erin pretended not to notice.\n“I must say, it’s quite amazing—I feel relieved to have finally tied a match against you, Erin. I was beginning to think it was impossible.”\nShe blushed and waved a hand at him. It felt extremely embarrassing to be treated like some kind of chess genius, especially since she knew she wasn’t. Erin was about to suggest a rematch with different rules when she looked over at the watching Worker Antinium.\n“Do you want to play?”\nThe Antinium she was addressing sat up in his seat and bowed to her. Quickly, Klbkch sat up, but the Worker spoke before he did.\n“This Worker would not presume to…play.”\nErin frowned. Did that mean he wanted to play but he was afraid to?\n“Why not give it a shot? I’ll teach you how to play, and we can always make more chess boards. All we need is a few pieces of paper and a pen.”\nShe went into the kitchen and pulled out a few pieces of paper and a quill and ink. It had made her feel like a wizard when she’d first bought the quill, and then she’d wished for a computer and a printer five seconds after she’d had to actually dip the quill every few words when she wrote.\nAs her guests watched, Erin drew a rough chess board on a piece of parchment and then tore up other pieces. She carefully drew symbols on them to show which were pawns and which were other pieces and put the makeshift chess board on the table. She put two of the Antinium Workers in chairs facing each other across the board.\nIt was the most low-key chess board Erin had ever seen, but the Antinium stared at the scraps of paper with total concentration.\n“Okay, so how much did you guys see when I played chess with Klbkch and Olesm? Do you know how to set up the board?”\nInstantly, both Antinium moved. Erin recoiled for a second, but they merely rearranged the pieces on the chess board with mechanical precision. In seconds, each side was set up. Erin blinked at them.\n“Good. Good. And, uh, show me how this piece moves?”\nObediently, the Antinium Worker moved the piece forwards.\n“And can you move it from left to right?”\n“This one does not believe so.”\nKlbkch hovered over the board. As always, he had few features Erin could read, but he appeared distressed for some reason.\n“Address her by her title.”\nThe Antinium instantly bowed his head at Erin.\n“Apologies, Innkeeper Solstice. This one does not believe the pawn piece moves left and right.”\nErin gave Klbkch a half annoyed glance, but turned back to the Worker.\n“Right, that’s true! Very good. And show me how it takes a piece?”\nHe showed her.\n“Good. But did you know there’s one more move the pawn can do?”\nInstantly, the other Antinium and the Goblins watching the game were filled with attention. They stared as Erin showed them how to take a piece\nen passant\nand explained the unique rules around that action. The Antinium she was coaching immediately bowed its head to her.\n“This one was unaware of this fact. This one apologizes to Innkeeper Solstice for its failure.”\n“What? Don’t apologize. Not many players know about that move. How could you? Now, let’s have you play a game with your friend.”\nErin stepped back as the two Antinium Workers stared at each other in silence. For a moment, she was afraid they’d do nothing, but then the first Worker moved his pawn up to E5. After a moment, the other Workers replied with the Sicilian Defense, and then the game was on.\nPiece after piece moved with minimal pausing in between. At first, Erin was afraid they were recreating her games with Klbkch and Olesm, but the two players were playing their own game. It took her a while to realize they were still playing by Lightning rules. Once she’d explained they could take their time, the game slowed.\nErin stared at the two Workers playing each other in complete silence and then looked around at her audience.\n“Anyone else want to play?”",

    "text": "Silence. It was the sound of funerals and churches, except that it wasn’t. Rather, it was the sound you thought should be in such places, but really was more like an ideal goal than the truth.\nIt was the sound of chess tournaments, though. Erin circulated the inn, filling plates with dead flies and pouring water (she’d run out of blue juice), and felt like she was home as she listened to the\nclick\nof chess pieces moving, or, more often, the shuffling of dry paper.\n“Oh. How’s the game going? Anyone want more flies? How about pasta? A cup of jui—water?”\nErin passed by each board and watched as Antinium and even Goblins played each other. There were eight boards set up, and the players rotated with each other once someone lost.\nHer natural instincts as a chess player warred with her desire to give the new players advice. She compromised by letting Olesm and Klbkch offer commentary and then dissected games after they’d been played out by recreating them and pointing out good or bad moves.\nThe Antinium Workers watched Erin’s every move and listened to her words with frightening attention. She’d heard the word ‘rapt’ used to describe people, but never had she met a group so completely focused as the Workers. It was frankly unnerving, but her love of explaining chess moves and strategies more than made up for the awkwardness.\nThat was one thing. But what really amazed Erin and even Olesm and Klbkch were the Goblins. They were playing chess.\nOkay, not well and not quickly, but the Goblins were sitting down and giving each other spirited, if not particularly well thought out games. The exception was the smallest Goblin, Rags, who had actually beaten two of the Antinium Workers back-to-back.\nErin stopped in front of one of the real chess boards as Rags slid into the seat opposite. It was technically Klbkch’s turn to play, but the Goblin stared at her. It was an obvious challenge.\n“I’ll play you, if you want. You’re white, so go ahead.”\nRags eyed Erin defiantly and moved her knight first. Erin hid a smile.\n“Oh, the Baltic Opening, huh? Well…”\nShe moved a pawn two squares up directly in front of the knight. It was her favorite way to deal with that opening move. Rags frowned and then moved another piece. And then another. For a while, the Goblin looked like a strange, green kid playing chess. That was until she opened her mouth and Erin saw the sharp teeth. But Rags still looked a lot less threatening than before.\nErin crushed her while she served the last of her pasta to the Goblins and had a bite to eat herself.",

Each time, Rags handily lost, but Erin was impressed by the way the small Goblin was willing to try new strategies. She said so.\n“You guys could learn a lot from her. Most of these moves are actually established patterns. Okay, moving the rook right away wasn’t a good choice, but you’re better than most beginners.”\nShe smiled at Rags. The Goblin fidgeted in her chair and looked away.\nKlbkch nodded, and Olesm expressed an interest in playing the Goblin. Erin looked over at the Workers. They were eying her surreptitiously. She had the impression they wanted to play her too.\nShe clapped her hands together and smiled.\n“Now then. Anyone else want to play another game?”",

I wasn’t aware of your trap until you moved your bishop up.”\nErin yawned and grinned sleepily at him. Around her, the Goblins sat or lay on the tables, sleepily watching the game.\n“You keep giving away too many pawns. They’re more valuable than you think.”\nOlesm bowed his head and nearly toppled over. He jerked upright and nodded at her.\n“I shall keep it in mind, Erin.”\nShe nodded and yawned again.\n“Anyone want to play another game? Klbkch?”\nThe ant man shook his head. He glanced towards the door and at the Workers still playing chess. They were still intensely staring at the paper chess boards without any sign of fatigue.\n“It is late. I am afraid we must take our leave, Miss—Erin. If I may address you in that way.”\nErin blinked at Klbkch and then looked out the window.\n“Oh, of course you can call me that, Klbkch. And wow, it\nis\nlate!”\nShe stood up. Immediately, the Workers stopped playing chess and stood too. They bowed to her.\n“Allow me to thank you and pay you in their place, Erin.”\nKlbkch handed her a bag of silver and gold coins. Erin blinked down at it.\n“Oh. That’s a lot.”\n“It is only fair payment for what we have consumed. And, might I trouble you to ask for a container of Acid Flies? I wish to bring some back to Liscor.”\n“What? Oh, sure. I’ve actually got a huge glass jar. Do you want it?”\n“Please.”\nErin ended up giving Klbkch a huge jar full of Acid Flies for a gold coin. She felt guilty about it, but the Antinium insisted it was a fair price. He left with Olesm and the Workers in tow, and Erin saw the Goblins off as they slowly streamed out of her inn.\n“Come again! I’ll feed you lot another meal if you come by. You don’t need to pay—you paid me enough this time. Okay?”\nThe Goblins grunted or waved their hands awkwardly at her. They filed out of the inn, patting their stomachs happily.\nThe paper chess board and pieces were in a big pile. The Goblins seemed less keen on them—perhaps because they thought this inn was their chess spot to play in safety. Klbkch had told Erin giving the Workers the game was not a good idea. So she silently waited until he was talking with Olesm by the door and handed a Worker the entire stack. The Worker promptly hid the papers behind its back and shuffled towards the door with the others.\nThe last Goblin, Rags, paused as she walked by Erin. The small Goblin held her hands tightly at her side.\n“Hey.”\nErin tapped Rags on the head. She held out her hand. Silently, the small Goblin handed her the pawn back as the other Goblins glared at her.\n“No stealing. Besides, a chess board isn’t complete without all the pieces.”\nRag’s eyes lit up. Erin narrowed hers.\n“That doesn’t mean you can steal them either. If you want to play a game, come back any time. Okay?”\nFor a while, the little Goblin hesitated and then nodded. Erin smiled.\n“Have a good night.”\nShe closed the door. Then she bolted it and made sure all the windows were fastened tight. She didn’t mind the small Goblin, but she was damned if she was going to let it walk off with her chess set.",

He was setting a fast pace, and Olesm was struggling to keep up.\n“My apologies, Olesm Swifttail. I had forgotten you were with us.”\n“No, it’s nothing.”\nOlesm gasped and wheezed as Klbkch slowed. The Workers behind him silently adjusted their pace to give the two room.\n“I just wanted to talk to you—if I may.”\n“Certainly. May I ask if you are addressing your comment to the liaison of the Antinium or Senior Guardsmen Klbkch?”\n“Both, I believe. Um, how shall I put this?”\nOlesm paused as the two strode through the night. Klbkch waited patiently until the Drake began.\n“As the [Tactician] who liaisons with the Council and other guilds and the guard, I am privy to some confidential information. I am, uh, aware of the situation with the Workers within the Antinium. R-regarding Aberrations and how they appear.”\n“Indeed?”\nKlbkch’s voice was flat. He was normally quite friendly, but this statement instantly put him on guard and small wonder. The Watch and the Council were there to check the Hive as a threat.\nOlesm glanced nervously behind him at the Workers. They silently stared back at him.\n“Will—will this be a problem, do you think?”\nKlbkch hesitated. He looked back, and the Workers instantly looked down at the ground.\n“We shall see. They will be observed as usual, and I will personally supervise them.”\n“Ah, good, good. I wouldn’t ask, but I know that these kinds of things have, uh, dire consequences. This isn’t to say that I’m against taking a few Workers out under supervision, but the Watch Captain and Council—”\nKlbkch turned and faced Olesm. The [Tactician] stopped nervously, but Klbkch merely bowed respectfully.\n“I understand your concerns. If it helps, I will address this topic in my monthly report to inform you of any significant changes. I shall note our conversation and these instances most rigorously in my report to Captain Zevara.”\nOlesm sighed in relief.\n“Thank you. Yes, that’s perfect! Just so we have a written record.”\nThey went on, and Klbkch resumed their conversation in a more casual manner, to Olesm’s relief.\n“I trust you have enjoyed yourself tonight?”\n“Oh, yes. Very. Erin—that is, Miss Erin Solstice is quite a remarkable Human, isn’t she?”\n“Indeed.”\n“Quite remarkable.”\n“Her mastery of the game of chess may be unmatched within the continent.”\n“Absolutely.”\n“Indeed.”\nA moment of painful silence. Then Klbkch’s head rotated slowly, and he said something completely unexpected.\n“…Would you like to play a game after this, by any chance?”\nKlbkch glanced at the Drake, and Olesm hesitated. Senior Guardsman Klbkch was a known figure in Liscor who had won his approval over a long time, but Olesm knew his past, and he knew more about the dangers of the Antinium than most as Liscor’s [Tactician]. Yet right at this moment—he thought he had never known Klbkch more.\nThe two losers of endless bouts with Erin looked at each other, and Olesm managed a smile and a nod.\n“It would be my pleasure.”",

The Goblins who had gone with the littlest Goblin to the inn crept back to their cave and did not tell the others why they weren’t that hungry and where they’d been.\nBut the one thing Olesm and Klbkch didn’t realize was this. While they sat and had a genteel game of chess at Olesm’s office, trying out new moves and what Erin had taught them, it failed to occur to them that they were not the only people who had learned something from Erin.\nThe Workers had a bundle of paper slips. While they were supposed to be asleep, one slowly, slowly let a chess board fall to the floor of the Hive. Then, as many Workers watched, another slowly placed down the chess ‘pieces’, the squares of paper, just like they’d been shown.\nAfter all—this made sense to them. It was just numbers and patterns, and the [Innkeeper] had played with them.\nThe Goblins did not have any paper chess boards, because it would invariably be used as toilet paper or kindling for a fire. But the littlest Goblin was busy arranging some grass and sticks into an odd formation, and the rest of her tribe ignored her. She was always weird, and they didn’t see why she was thinking and placing them in odd positions on the ground.\nKlbkch and Olesm retired after a few games, and Olesm levelled up that night, much to his delight. But that was nothing to the voice which spoke to the many confused and frightened Antinium who panicked because they were going to get in trouble. It said the exact same thing to the littlest Goblin and a few others, who sat up in confusion and awe.\nThe voice said:\n[Tactician Class Obtained!]\n[Tactician Level 2!]\n[Skill – Risk Calculation obtained!]\n[Skill – Group: Erratic Maneuvering obtained!]\nOr some variation of that in level and Skills.

    "text": "The Ruins of Albez sit at the heart of what had once been a magical kingdom. Or perhaps a community of mages. Or an ancient citadel of—you know what? It doesn’t matter. There’s almost nothing left anymore to tell a visitor what it had been.\nOnce, this hillside of collapsed dirt and dug-out structures was something vast and incredible. When the first people found the Ruins of Albez, the records indicate that they noticed a dome of glass two hundred feet wide poking out of the ground. They dug down and found magical stone, entire wings of preserved libraries, and magical laboratories.\n—And monsters. Over eighty-nine years, the ruins were stripped, first quickly, then slower as fewer and fewer groups found anything of note. The monsters remained, and then the remaining rubble that wasn’t magical became pockets of tagged debris, with symbols from older teams of adventurers and treasure seekers who left markings to show what had been explored—or throw other groups off the scent.\nFrom the dirt excavation, the ruins looked more like an archeologist’s project, with entire excavated rooms and areas laid bare to the sun. Plenty of ruined edifices and roofs to hide under, despite that. Which is the true danger. Any number of people might come here to explore on the vague chance of finding a magical item worth a year’s earnings—if not for the monsters.\nThe entire area is saturated in magic, so much so that it makes my hair tingle.\nMy actual\nhair\ntingles. It’s not like static electricity, more like a kind of energy filling you up. So similar—but it has a different feel than the pure charge of the air. It makes you feel alive. No wonder monsters love coming here, because this place is a wonderful home for them to live in, especially if they eat magic.\nFinal fact from my quick research into the area. Albez is built on a leyline. Before the Humans came, it was apparently settled by a tribe of ‘Gnolls’, furry folk who used to live here. Which explains the issue.\nOn one side, you have monsters who are inhabiting this area. On the other, you have adventurers, hoping to find what no one has discovered. Naturally, conflicts ensue.\nI’m staring down at one of the open courtyards from my position on a hilltop. Actually, I’m prone, and the grass is really itchy. A big chunk of stone gives me additional cover, and I doubt anything can see me—because I can’t see much of anything unless I raise my head high enough. But I’m not about to get up. I can see a\nflash\nand then a brilliant blue crackle of lightning.\nSlower than regular lightning.\nBut ‘slower’ in the sense that it flashes across the ground, strikes a pillar where someone dives to safety, and blows a goddamn\nchunk\nout of solid stone. I swallow.\nThat’s going to do the same to me if it hits.\nAnd then—wonderful—I see the lightning bolt followed by a ball of roiling flames. It lands as someone shouts below.\n“[Fireball]!\nCover—\n”\nSomeone runs five feet,\nleaps\n, and clears the blast zone just in time. The ball of fire expands, and the shockwave actually makes the air move around me. Someone drags away the figure who made it to safety; the blast kicked them like a mule, and I have to imagine they’ve been deafened and possibly blinded and baked by the heat.\nThat’s magic.\nCombat magic, and it’s really, really unfortunate I’m going to be running down there. But from the looks of it—the group of people ducking the hostile spells need my delivery right now.\n“\nHealing potion! Get me a healing—\n”\nSomeone’s shouting. The other figures mill about, but they’re out. I can see a woman with a bow poke her head up, dodge an arrow that rattles off her cover, and loose an arrow back.\nIt doesn’t seem to do much good, but it does draw the ire of the enemy spellcaster. Another streak of magic shoots her way—another lightning bolt. I’ve seen two spells so far, and they’re either a ball of fire or bolt of lightning.\nI’d say it’s stereotypical, but it’s working. But what amazes me is that the woman with a bow doesn’t die—she takes cover, and a huge voice shouts. A bull-man with horns roars.\n“\nHorns! Move up and support Marian! Ceria, take out that spellcaster! Shields up!\n”\nTen figures move forwards, taking cover and spreading out around the courtyard, loosing arrows and charging to meet yellowed skeletons holding swords and rusted axes. But they’re watching the spellcaster all the while, forcing it to attack people in cover.\nThey actually have good strategy. Which is the only reason they survived long enough to send a [Message] spell for help, I guess.\nThe adventuring group currently occupying the ruins is known as the Horns of Hammerad. A Silver-rank team notable for their relatively high average level—most members are above level 20—and their leader, a Minotaur [Fighter]* who wields an enormous battleaxe in combat.\n*I still don’t get classes. Apparently, [Fighter] is a general class, although some call it [Warrior] depending on the culture. Does that mean they have the same Skills? Either way, it’s the first class most warriors take, but if this Minotaur guy were higher-level, he’d be an [Axemaster] or [Knight]. But we call him a [Fighter] or [Warrior] because we don’t know his exact class. Because that’s private. Huh.\nThe general consensus is that they’re quite competent in combat, and they’d received official permission to search the ruins for the duration of the week. That means that while the Horns are in the ruins, other adventuring groups can’t interfere or look for treasure. It was an arrangement that allowed the nearby cities to reap a profit for charging access and prevented conflicts between their adventurers.\nAll well and good, and normally, the Horns would have expected a moderate payout at the very least. They were well equipped and prepared for anything.\nWhich was why the sight of their disorganized party fighting and retreating across the ruins is even more alarming. The roaring bull man is hacking down a skeleton one-handed with an axe, but he can barely move.\n…Because of the spike of ice lodged in his midsection. He’s got it covered with a tourniquet, and he’s, somehow, still upright and fighting. But then I see a deadly hail of ice shards flying towards another adventurer and gulp.\nThe other warriors and mages—the Horns of Hammerad is a large party, ten members strong—are either hunkered down or exchanging shots with the monster that has cornered them.\nEven as I watch, an armored warrior deflects a sword strike from one of the skeletons attacking their group and smashes it with a mace. The skeleton falls to the ground, lifeless. But that’s attracted the attention of the leader of the undead, and a huge blast of fire engulfs the area once more.\nI wince as the armored warrior runs out of the blaze screaming in agony. He rolls on the ground as a mage with a staff shoots a few magic bolts of rippling light to attract attention away from him. Two other adventurers rush forth and drag the burnt warrior into cover as a hail of ice spikes nearly pincushions all three.\nWell, crap. That’s the fifth member of the Horns down. I was hoping they’d sway the battle, but at this rate, they’ll be wiped out. No help for it.\nI shouldn’t go down there. The [Receptionist] whose name I can’t remember\ntold\nme not to risk it. Either signal them to grab the potions or wait till the fight is over. Even for an Emergency Delivery, a Runner is under no obligation to risk their lives in an active combat zone.\nThat thing firing off spells could kill me in a single shot.\nEven if I wanted to risk it, it’s smarter to wait and find a way to sneak down. But I can hear someone screaming for a potion. So…slowly, I get up and feel at my legs. The broken stones still obscure most of my body if I shuffle over to where it’s at its highest.\nI take two deep breaths and then stretch my legs out. Right leg? Check. Left leg? Stretching…check. Okay.\nI peek over the piece of rubble I’m hiding behind. Clear? Okay.\nHere we go—\nI vault the rubble and dash down the slope. From where I am, there’s a moderate incline down into the heart of the ruins, where fallen buildings and rubble make for treacherous ground. Loose stones can twist my ankle, or I can kick a piece of stone at high-speed and break my toes.\nBut what’s worse is the danger of being killed by the monster fifty feet in front of me. The problem is that I arrived on the wrong side of the ruins. So I’m closer to it than the adventurers.\nI charge down the hill towards it. The robed figure notices me as I’m halfway there and turns. Two glowing blue points of light in its eyes shift towards me as I sprint directly at it. A jaw made of bone clatters open, and I see a dead…skeletal body rotate my way.\nIt’s a Lich*, an undead skeletal mage. The skeleton looks wrong, like a reptile, and the bones are subtly different, yet it is a skeleton—it even has a skeletal\ntail\n, and the ancient robes hanging on its body are the only things not worn away by rot.\n*I personally have problems with calling it a Lich. Apparently, unlike in games and stories, Liches are rather common. They’re more like an undead type rather than unique and rare examples of mages living forever. They’re not even that deadly. Well, they’re very deadly, but even scarier types of undead exist apparently.\nFor a second, I don’t think it even knows what it’s seeing. A lone Human running straight at it without a weapon? It hesitates, but then raises a finger. This would be the part where I die in its plan. In mine? I\nthink\nI survive.\nIf it seems stupid to charge at a monster capable of blasting me to bits with a single spell, well, it probably is. But I had a good reason for doing it. Over the last five minutes, I’d scoped out the Lich’s battle against the group of adventurers and picked out a few important details about how it acted. I had three good reasons for my plan of action.\nReason A: I’d noticed that the Lich could cast several spells, such as a miniaturized lightning bolt, a fireball, and those nasty showers of ice spikes. Of the three, I really only had to worry about the fireball and the ice spikes. The lightning looked dangerous, but it grounded itself too easily at a long distance on the nearest object. Since I’m not wearing any metal, it would be far harder for the Lich to hit me.\nAs for the fireballs and ice spikes, well, they were slower and the Lich had to point first. Its aim also wasn’t the greatest in the world. It was a risk, but so long as I didn’t get cooked when the fireball exploded, I had a shot.\nAlso, Reason B: was that I’d noticed the Lich tended to defend itself with a barrier of bones it summoned from the ground whenever anything got close. That stopped it from casting spells for a few seconds.\nAnd Reason C: I’m stupid.\nThe Lich pointed at me and cackled something that made my ears\nhurt\n. I dove and rolled and felt my right side go slightly numb. It felt like the worst static electricity shock I’d ever experienced times a hundred, but that meant the lightning had missed me. And I was still alive.\nHit the ground, roll onto my feet and run. I closed on the Lich, and it raised a protective hand. As I expected, a wall of bones erupted from the ground in front of me, a grotesque puzzle of interlocked bones and skulls as solid as rock*.\n*Seriously. How the hell does it do that? Are there that many bones in the ground? Or is it just magic?\nNow’s my chance. I immediately veer left and accelerate towards where the adventurers are. The Lich makes a\ncrackling\nnoise as it realizes it’s been duped. It tries to lower the bone barrier, but it’s too late.\nRun\n.\nRun faster\n.\nDodge behind the pillar. Pause. Go left. Move right. Fireball! Close. Now—sprint left as fast as possible.\nIn one of the many safety seminars my dad made me attend after every mass shooting, they taught us what to do if a gunman ever opened fire and we had to escape. Some of it was common sense stuff like don’t scream or do something stupid and think before moving. But I did remember one important tip.\nWhen someone’s firing at you, don’t run in a straight line to get away. Zig zag, make it hard for them to get a bead on you. And in my case, duck behind rubble and place as many obstacles between me and the Lich as possible.\nI run, and I run as fast as I can. The instant I slow, I’m dead. The air around me is static; fire explodes around me, and flying ice threatens to pierce my skin.\nYou can’t tell, and I don’t have a mirror, but I’m pretty sure I’m grinning.",

    "text": "“Status?”\nCalruz, leader of the Horns of Hammerad, grunted at the other warrior as the two hid behind one of the fallen walls in the ruins. The Human, his second-in-command, glanced down at him and shook his head grimly.\n“I think Terr got hit by a [Fireball]. Coblat and Grimsore dragged him away, but he’s down for the count as well.”\n“\nDamn.\n”\nThe Minotaur hit his thigh and winced. The huge spear of ice protruding out of his midriff oozed more dark blood, and he sat back against the wall and breathed out. The tendons on his neck strained, and sweat stood out on his brow despite the freezing cold.\n“What about Ceria and Sostrom? Why the hell aren’t they taking this thing out? We are a\ndisgrace\nof a team.”\nCeria and Sostrom were their [Mages]. The other man grimaced as he saw someone poke her head up, swivel around with her pointed ears twitching, then\nduck\nan arrow loosed by a skeleton holding a bow. It was more amazing that the filthy, corroded bow and string could even fire, but it did, and the arrow was weak and badly aimed—but it could still do a lot of damage.\nSo could the skeletons charging their flanks on-and-off. A rusted hatchet from the bone limbs wasn’t nearly as hard as Calruz could hit someone—but a sharp blade would still cut or kill by infection later, and there were a lot of skeletons.\nEven so—they would have taken the lesser skeletons to pieces an hour ago, when the fight began. As it was, they were barely surviving, and they’d burned through all their healing potions. Because of the Lich. The other man scratched at his mustache soaked with sweat, a habit, and glanced out again as the half-Elf poked her head up.\n“They’re trying, but whenever they fire at that monster, it just raises a shield. It’s got more mana than all of our casters combined. We need to get in close if we want a chance.”\n“Fat chance of that happening with all those skeletons and zombies guarding it.”\n“I think Terr got rid of the last of them, but we still can’t get close. It’s too flaming\nquick\n.”\n“We have to.”\nThat was all the Minotaur said. He grimly stared at the spike of ice in his stomach. If he pulled it out, how long did he have?\n“Do you have half a potion left, Gerial? Give it to me. I’ll yank this out and charge. Everyone who can move goes.”\n“You’ll get roasted. No way.”\nGerial glanced at the Minotaur in alarm. He was two heads shorter than the bull man, and Calruz’s biceps were massive; he was a fit warrior even by the standards of his people. Right now, his eyes were clear blue and concentrated with pain and cold calm.\n“We must take the monster down. No Runner can get to us with it here, and no other adventuring team can bail us out. I am Beriad of the House of Minos. It would be a disgrace for me to let my team down.”\n“Beriad my ass.”\nCalruz turned, snorting, and Gerial grabbed his arm.\n“We’re not doing a suicide charge. Just give Ceria a chance. If she can damage it, we’ll fall back and try to escape. The horses are—”\nA sudden commotion stopped the argument dead, and Calruz lifted his axe, swearing. If it was another skeleton horde, they were in trouble.\nThe vice-captain of the Horns of Hammerad chanced a peek around the wall he was hiding behind. There didn’t seem to be any more [Fireballs] coming his way at the moment, which was good and also worrying. Had the Lich turned its attention elsewhere? Doubtful. But then why—\nHis jaw dropped. Gerial focused on something in the distance as Calruz whispered an oath to his homeland. His hand tightened around the piece of ice to tear it loose—when he heard Gerial exclaim, and his tone was different.\n“Who is\nthat?\n”\nCalruz grunted and tried to twist his head, but fell back weakly.\n“Who? What’s happening?”\n“It’s a Runner! She just charged down the hill at the Lich! She’s coming this way!”\nThe Minotaur’s eyes opened wide.\n“You’re joking. She’ll never make it.”\n“She’s doing it.”\nThe vice-captain watched as the long-legged runner dashed across the broken landscape. She was leaping over pieces of rubble and running in a serpentine motion while fireballs and shards of ice rained down around her. From this distance, all he could see was raven-black hair and tanned skin, but the vice-captain was sure he’d never seen this particular runner before.\nShe had odd features, which would have told him she was part-Japanese, or at least Asian, if those words had meant anything to him.\n“She’s foreign. Chandrarian? Balerosian?”\nHe turned, and the Minotaur edged over. He glanced out and grunted.\n“You idiot. She’s Drathian.”\n“\nDrathian?\nWhat’s one of them doing across the world?”\n“No clue. Shut up—\ngive that Runner covering fire! Everyone up!\n”\nGerial himself lowered his sword to grab a loose rock and\nheave\nit in the general direction of the Lich. It fell well short, but several arrows and a spike of ice made the undead turn and begin firing their way. Yet it was still after the Runner, and every second, the Minotaur expected to see her go down with the next spell.\nAny second he expected her to be blown away by an on-target [Fireball] or be seared by a lightning blast. But she didn’t. And then she was right on top of Gerial.",

    "text": "Ryoka leapt around a pillar of stone and slammed into the Human man in armor. She knocked into him and felt cool metal before she stumbled back. He pulled her into cover as icicle shards\ncrashed\nagainst the rubble.\nIt took her two deep breaths of air before she could speak. Ryoka unslung her pack and nodded at the gaping vice-captain.\n“Delivery.”\n“\nDead gods!\n”\nThe vice-captain stared at Ryoka. He gestured to her, the ruins, and then waved his gauntleted hands a bit.\n“That was the\nmost amazing\nsight I’ve ever—you just ran right past that Lich! Are you insane? Or crazy?”\nShe was pretty sure she was. But Ryoka’s mouth was on autopilot as she fumbled with her pack.\nWas she dead?\nShe felt alive! But there were explosions going off as the Lich attacked, and she turned to the two. Then she recoiled as she saw the\nMinotaur\nstaring down at her.\nHe was seven feet tall.\nBefore\nhis horns. Maybe some of that was due to the steel armor he wore, but he was a mammoth!\nImagine a bull’s face on a humanoid body, only he had toes, or what she thought were toes, in feet-like boots. Chestnut fur, short and fairly smooth, covered every inch of his body, and two horns, again, curved like a bull’s, sprang from his head. But there were two caps of gold on the tips of the horns and his eyes were intelligent, if strained with pain at this moment.\nHe looked like a monster himself, out of Greek legend—but only for a second. He held that axe with too much care, and his eyes flitted to his companion and his team, with urgency and attentiveness to their condition. So not a monster but another kind of man.\nDespite looking as though he should have been able to smash the Lich down one-handed, the spike of ice in his midsection showed Ryoka why the team was in trouble.\nIt was dripping with water and blood around a cloth bandage, and he was holding it with one huge hand, possibly supporting it so it didn’t pull a bunch of his organs\nout\nof his body. Ryoka’s mouth worked a second before she spoke.\n“I’m a Runner. I’ve got a delivery for the leader of the Horns of Hammerad. That you?”\n“That’s me.”\nOf all the stupid things to say—but he actually nodded to her. Sweat dripped off the Mintoaur’s brow as he bared his teeth.\n“Calruz of the Beriad, Captain of the Horns of Hammerad. Son of Minos, at your service.”\nHe was as polite and formal as could be—right until he tried to make a gesture with his free hand. His face twisted, and he muttered.\n“I hope you’ve got our delivery, Miss Runner.”\nRyoka nodded rapidly. She put her pack down, then yanked the top open and placed the heavily-wrapped bottles down on the ground in front of the Minotaur. Instantly, he reached for the bottles.\n“Fifteen healing potions, five mana potions. All unbroken. Delivery to Horns of Hammerad. Your seal?”\n“Seal? Oh, of course!”\nThey were all in shock. The vice-captain gave Ryoka a blank look, then automatically fumbled with his pouch. He pulled out a silver and copper token and handed it to her. It was a unique seal with a hammer standing on a mountain embossed on one side.\n“Thanks.”\nRyoka stowed the seal securely in her waist pouch and then peeked around the wall. The Lich was exchanging fireballs with another mage wearing a red wizard’s hat. She nodded to herself and lowered into a sprinter’s crouch.\n“Wait—are you going?”\nRyoka didn’t glance at the vice-captain as she tried to judge when would be the best moment.\n“Yep.”\n“You can’t! I mean, that’s even crazier!”\nThe vice-captain stared at Ryoka in consternation and then looked at his leader for support. Calruz was trying to open one of the bottles. He grunted as he pulled the cork out of one of the bottles and downed the thick, syrupy, green liquid. Instantly, he straightened and began to pull out the piece of ice. Ryoka watched in horrified fascination as his skin began to knit, starting to push the ice spike\nout\nof his body.\nThe Minotaur growled, and she saw his eyes slowly begin to turn red, the blue irises and whites filling with blood. He stood taller and slowly turned his head to the Lich, who stopped attacking the half-Elf screaming curses at it as if it could sense the danger.\n“Let her go if she wants. Runner—thanks for the assistance. Not many of your lot would do this. The Horns owe you a debt.”\nShe paused.\n“No problem.”\nHe nodded to her. She nodded back. Then the Minotaur yanked the piece of ice out and hurled it to the ground. An armored foot\nstomped,\nand it shattered to pieces. Gerial looked relieved, but he turned to Ryoka.\n“At least let us reassemble and give you a diversion. Once we get these potions to all our members, we can finally bring this guy down.”\nRyoka thought about it.\n“That’ll take too long. You want an opening? I’ll give you one. I’ve got more deliveries to make.”\nThe vice-captain tore at what hair he could reach underneath his helmet.\n“He’ll blast you the instant you leave cover!”\nShe grinned at the vice-captain, breaking her expressionless mask.\n“He can try.”\nThe Minotauar’s eyes opened wide, and he gave her a smile like hers. But his was blood and glory. He took a breath as his stomach wound closed and bellowed.\n“You heard her.\nHorns of Hammerad—\ncovering fire! Potions have arrived!”",

    "text": "Five minutes later, the adventuring party, the Horns of Hammerad, watched the Runner break out of the ruins and sprint away even as the Lich fired a final parting bolt of lightning in her direction. He missed. The Lich\nshrieked\n, a strangely piercing wail coming from the skeleton’s mouth, then turned to attack the adventurers.\nBut they were deep in cover, and it hovered, uncertainly, then raised a barrier of bones again. It couldn’t tell where they were—\nAnd they had regrouped. The half-Elf broke away from the healing potions going to her teammates, who were getting on their feet, cursing, and crabbed under a buttress of broken stone to where Gerial and Calruz were sitting. Gerial was mouthing to his Captain.\n“She did it. She actually did it.”\n“She told you.”\nCalruz grinned and watched the young woman disappearing over the hill. He turned as the half-Elf tapped him on the shoulder. Her blonde hair was sticking up from all the static electricity it had absorbed, and she looked exhausted from her running battle with the Lich.\nBut she too was getting a second wind; she held a wand at the ready, tip glowing faintly with frozen ice along the alabaster length of stone.\nWith the other hand, she was gulping down the foul, off-blue potion swimming with green swirls of color. She gagged, then spoke.\n“Is that a new Runner? She must be. I haven’t ever seen her before, and I think I would have remembered hearing about one as crazy as that. Dead gods, she saved us. Gerial, you alright? Marian is going to make it. So is Terr. He’s on his feet.”\n“Thank the Five Families.”\nGerial breathed out, and the Minotaur corrected him.\n“Thank the Runner. Ceria, how’s your mana?”\nShe grimaced. The half-Elf tipped the jar of liquid up, gulped it down, and her eyes bulged. Both Gerial and Calruz hesitated, afraid she’d spew it out, but she swallowed.\n“Potion’s working. Dead gods, that’s nasty. I bet Octavia made it. It tastes cheap and foul as hell.”\n“Coming from our bug-eating, tree-kissing half-Elf? It must be bad.”\nCeria jabbed Gerial with her wand before Calruz growled.\n“Stop bickering. We’re at full strength again, thanks to that Human. Speaking of. Did anyone catch the Runner’s name?”\nNeither Gerial nor Ceria had. The man scratched at his chin.\n“We can ask later. She looks different. Drathian, you said? She’s definitely new; no one around here has the guts to do an Emergency Run like that.”\nCeria raised her brows.\n“Drathian? Well, we can ask questions later. Potions are distributed. What’s our plan, boss? Charge in and eat another ice spike? My vote’s not to do that—the Lich can throw better spells than I can, and I’m the [Elementalist].”\nThe Minotaur gave Ceria a huge glare, and Gerial raised a hand as if to break them up. But this was just banter, and Calruz jerked his head over.\n“We take a page out of the Runner’s book. Did you see how she escaped it? We moved in too slow. This time, we spread out. No shields, just run from cover to cover. Gerial, you’ll take one group left. I’ll head right. Put Marian and the other archers up and tie it up. Force it to shield itself, and give me an opening. Ceria, can you tag it at least once?”\nThe half-Elf flexed her hands and produced a shard of ice from her palm. She grinned as her eyes seemed to regain a spark of…magic.\n“Can do.”\nCalruz raised his voice.\n“Horns! Did you hear that? We’re going in. The Runner’s bought us our moment, and we’ll all buy her a drink.\nBut I’ll be drinking it out of that Lich’s damned skull.\nAdvance!”\nHe swung himself up as the Lich whirled. It raised a staff, and a spike of ice shot towards the Minotaur, but Gerial was already up and his shield caught the spell. He stumbled back, swearing, but before the Lich could fire a bolt of lightning from one hand, a shard of ice hit it in one eye-socket.\nIt recoiled, skull cracked from the force of the blow. It looked up and saw a half-Elf pointing a wand at it. She grinned, and then shard after shard of ice began firing from her wand, hitting the Lich with pinpoint precision. Then the other adventurers were emerging from cover, shouting as they sprinted for positions closer.\nThe last skeletons rose to their feet to defend their leader as the Minotaur emerged with a roar,\npunching\nthrough one’s ribcage without even deigning to swing his axe. The Lich recoiled, trying to back up, but it was too late.\nAs one, the Horns of Hammerad abandoned their position in the ruins and began a full-scale assault on the Lich and the remaining undead.",

White blisters were already rising on her skin.\nIt hurt. She had nearly died, and her legs trembled. She felt cold and remembered that shiver of seeing the flames burning in the hollow sockets of the Lich’s skull.

    "text": "I’m still high on adrenaline when I’m standing at the Runner’s Guild, in front of a [Receptionist]. Shame it doesn’t make this part easier.\n“You completed the supply request for the Horns of Hammerad?”\n“Yep.”\nThe receptionist stares at me. I shrug. What does she want me to say? I nearly died? Liches are scary?\nI feel like I’m in a different world. The worn-down room of the Runner’s Guild is a far cry from the grassy plains or the rubble and destruction of the Ruins of Albez. The woman raises her brows. This isn’t the one I recognize, by the by. This is a middle-aged woman with a frizzy shock of green hair in a stripe running through her brown hair. I think it’s not even a style; some people just have magical hair as part of their genetics.\nLucky. She’s taking notes, and she looks relieved.\n“That’s incredible. Are the Horns already finished fighting? The magic communication we got said they were fighting a Lich and a horde of the undead.”\nI shake my head as a few Runners in line poke their heads up, interested. I point, as if I’m pointing at the distant ruins.\n“They’re still fighting. The Lich is still around. Not sure about the other undead. Looked like they were mostly dead. Undead.”\nThe receptionist doesn’t smile. Didn’t she get the joke? Darn. She’s still giving me that ‘I-don’t-believe-you’ look. I hand her the Seal.\n“Here’s the Seal from the Horns of Hammerad.”\nShe checks it over and then double-checks. Her eyebrows rise.\n“It’s real. So you’re telling me you delivered the supplies in the middle of the battle?”\nWhy is she making a big fuss? I thought that’s what all Runners did on this kind of mission.\n“Yup. Emergency Run, right?”\n“Incredible.”\nI’m silent. I mean, what am I supposed to say to that?\n‘Oh, yeah, I’m really amazing, now give me my money?’\nAfter a few moments, the receptionist finally shakes herself.\n“You could go to Invrisil, if you cared to risk your life like that. The City of Adventurers always headhunts brave Runners. But a\nLich\n? Well, well, this is all in order. Would you like the payment now or…?”\n“Later.”\nI can collect my pay whenever, but most Runners do it in one lump sum at the end of the week. It’s more convenient that way since we have to sign to confirm we’ve been paid and the receptionist has to validate it. The [Receptionist] is still staring at me, and she smiles.\n“Well, I think you’ve earned your break. Unless—do you think you could do another delivery? I wouldn’t ask, but you’re the only City Runner here right now.”\nI’m tired, but that’s only because of my adrenaline low. I know my legs have got at least another good run in them, so I nod.\n“Where to?”\n“Celum. It’s another request from Lady Magnolia. Another Runner just brought it from Remendia, but he’s too tired to keep going. It’s been passed from six Runners so far, and we need to get it to Magnolia within the hour if possible.”\nOkay. Now that’s tricky. I hesitate.\nIt’s not that I don’t think I can do it in time. I can get to Celum in less than an hour even with something heavy on my back. But I’d done another run for Magnolia—delivering a big, fancy vase—a few days ago. By the ‘unwritten rules,’ that meant I should wait for at least another week before I took the request.\nDamn. Damnation. Drat. Fals’ warning sticks with me, and I’m half tempted to take the delivery just because I hated his annoying hints and threats. On the other hand…I don’t need to meet Magnolia Reinhart again.\nWhat should I do? This is the exact kind of situation I hate. I glance around at the other Runners and see mostly Street Runners.\n“There aren’t any other City Runners around?”\nThe receptionist shakes her head.\n“They’re all out on deliveries, and I don’t want to wait longer than I have to. I was about to ask one of the Street Runners to do the delivery, but that would have been a problem too.”\nWell, in that case…why not? The Magnolia rule can go to hell for all I care.\n“I’ll do it.”\nThe receptionist smiles in relief.\n“Thank y—”\n“Hold on!”\nThe receptionist’s head turns. My head doesn’t. I’m taking this moment to say a few choice words in my head*.\n*Oh, please no. Not that stupid, inbred rodent girl. No one in the world has a voice more high-pitched and annoying than her and her moronic cronies. I’d rather go back and dance naked in front of the Lich than deal with this.\nI turn and see a familiar face. She stands in the doorway of the Runner’s Guild, wiping sweat from her face. She looks at me as her two best friends, Claudeil and Toriska, wave at the Runners inside. They’re both taller than she is, but she’s in charge.\nTwo pigtails instead of a braid, brown, flax hair, despite all the gels she puts in it, and she looks like she’s starving.\nOr hungry. She’s thin, but she always looks like someone’s just snatched a sandwich from her, and I’ve never seen her not looking accusatory. Especially now as she gives me a triumphant look as if she’s just caught me red-handed. Today, she’s wearing a light-green hooded jacket to keep out of the rain and long, loose leggings like most Runners. She also wears open-toed sandals when she runs, the monster, secured by leather ties.\nShe’s famous enough that other Runners turn and some smile at her, but I see a few just looking apprehensive behind their smiles. The [Receptionist] in front of me actually makes a small groaning sound, and I look at the worst Runner in the region.\nPersua. Her voice is strident, high-pitched, and makes me long for the whine of a [Fireball] passing by my ears. Especially if it hits her. She gives me a huge smirk.\n“There’s no need to give Magnolia’s request to her. I’ve just arrived, and I can take care of it myself.”\nThe young woman—no, the annoying teenager who strides towards me brushes past to stand at the counter. She keeps her back very straight, probably because I’m taller than her by a head. I catch the overpowering smell of perfume masking her sweat and step back so her brown hair doesn’t smack me in the face every time she tosses her head. Which she does quite often.\nI know her. Or rather, I know her sallow* face. She always looks like she’s pursing her lips at everyone, and she annoys me every time I look at her.\n*Is sallow the right word here? I think it means pinched and narrow, but I could be wrong. That’s the problem with not having the internet. Anyways, her face is shrewish, although I forget what a shrew looks like too. I’m going with sallow either way.\n“Oh, Miss Persua. I didn’t know you were still in the city.”\nPersua. A name fit for her. Persua tosses her head impetuously and nods. Her two friends, Claudeil, all sneers and eyes on my chest, and Toriska, who looks straight past me, follow Persua over as if she needs the emotional support at all times. Persua herself is the worst, though, and she smirks as if she’s being clever.\n“Well, I\nwas\ndoing that delivery to Remendia, but once one of my friends let me know Magnolia’s request was sitting in the Runner’s guild, of\ncourse\nI came back to fulfill it.”\nShe\nwhat?\nI give her a blank stare. The receptionist looks uncomfortable.\n“You—haven’t finished the other delivery? Well, I was going to give the request to Ryoka. She’s free, and she’s—”\n“She’s already done a request for Magnolia this week. By rights, that means I should have a turn. Claudeil will do my run, right?”\nThe receptionist frowns at Persua. So does the young man. He brushes at his hair.\n“I will? I mean—of course, Persua. That frees it up. Toriska and I will go.”\n“I’m going with Persua. You can go—or Miss Ryoka can go, Claudeil. We can trade up!”\nToriska giggles, and the [Receptionist] stares at my face as I debate kicking the other Runner. Although—they are armed. Claudeil has a crossbow, and Toriska has a wand and knife for emergencies. I’ve seen both showing off their weapons to Street Runners.\nI bet I could kick them both in the face from here.\nHowever, the [Receptionist] breaks in, trying to mediate…Persua.\n“There’s no rule that explicitly gives precedence to other Runners. Besides which, I need this delivery done as quickly as possible. It is literally getting…warmer? As we speak.”\n“So?”\nAnother head toss. I notice some more of Persua’s ‘friends,’ the other Runners—mainly Street Runners who are new or lower on the totem pole—watching me. They always gather around when she appears. I stare at them until they look away. I hate their guts. Too bad Persua doesn’t back down as easily. Doubly too bad is her annoying voice.\n“I can easily do Magnolia’s request. Ryoka can just switch with me.”\nThe [Receptionist] was beginning to look exasperated.\n“It doesn’t work like that. Unless Ryoka agrees, I can’t just give this to you. Besides,\nas I’ve said\n, this is a speedy delivery. I can’t give it to—”\n“To what?”\nPersua looks at the receptionist coldly. But I fill in the gap silently in my mind, probably with everyone else in the Runner’s Guild.\nTo a slower runner. One of the slowest, in fact. Persua might be a City Runner, but she’s slow. Or lazy. Actually, she’s both. She’s also an idiot, but that’s just my observation. She doesn’t take as many long-distance contracts, and she only delivers light-weight stuff like flowers or letters.\nHowever, she does tend to get deliveries done—possibly because her friends often run with her. The [Receptionist] bites her tongue and tries a smile, which clearly fails, even to me.\n“I just meant that Ryoka is\nthe\nfastest City Runner. Even Fals can’t beat her time.”\n“Yes, but I’m\nsure\nshe’ll switch with me, won’t you, Ryoka?”\nPersua glances at me and then away. Passive-aggressive bitch*.\n*What language! I’m ashamed of myself. Mainly because I don’t have a wider vocabulary to describe someone like her. I could get vulgar, but I’d rather just slap her on the back of the head. Must resist temptation.\nI hesitate. I\nshould\ngive the request to Persua. Even if she fails it, there’s no skin off my back. In fact, if she gets in trouble for failing the request even better. Although she’ll probably wriggle out of it somehow.\nYeah, I hate her guts. And I don’t feel like giving in to her bullying, especially because I know the only reason she wants to do the delivery is for the easy money and the opportunity to sponge off of Magnolia. So you know what? Let’s escalate things.\n“It’s urgent.”\nThat’s not what Persua wants to hear. She glances at me in irritation.\n“So? I can make it.”\nThe receptionist glances around uncertainly.\n“If we can’t get it to Magnolia within the hour, the delivery won’t be any good. Can you make the run in time? It will\nmelt\n, that is what I am told, and the Runner’s Guild will bear the costs of reimbursing Lady Reinhart if it is ruined. I would like it there in forty minutes. Or less. Miss Persua, you have no sprinting Skills while Miss Ryoka is the fastest. Can you do it?”\nThis time, Persua noticeably swallows, but she glances at her two friends and then nods.\n“I can.”\n“So can\nI\n.”\nBoth the receptionist and I glance at Persua. She’s already sweating, probably from running back to the city to take the request.\n“Can you?”\nShe glares at me. But I know bodies, and I know running. Sallow girl is sweaty, tired, and she has terrible running form. I’ve done a run too, but unlike her, I know how to conserve energy. I turn to the receptionist.\n“Give me the request.”\nPersua’s sallow face grows even more pinched, if that were possible. She glares daggers at me.\n“That’s not\nfair.\nYou’ve already done a request. I deserve it! Claudeil and Toriska are both with me—they both deserve chances too!”\n“Toriska’s not even a City Runner yet.”\nThe other young woman glares daggers at me and reaches for her dagger, and Persua stamps her foot.\n“So? Claudeil is!”\n“Yeah, and you always deliver to Magnolia together. This isn’t about—getting to hobnob with her. She needs it fast? I’m ready.”\nThe idiot is ready to argue with me, but even Claudeil is hesitating because he knows I’m right. Persua strides over to poke at me and I’m ready to break her finger, but an urgent voice interrupts the two of us.\n“Persua, please.”\nThe receptionist is already wrestling with something under the counter. She lifts it up to me and gives me a smile of relief. I guess she really didn’t think Persua could do it either. She brings out a huge metal…canister?\nYes, a locking canister of metal. I blink because it’s more ornate than I thought this world had for metallurgy, but that’s the nobility for you. It’s\ncold\n, too, and I feel how heavy it is. Must be something solid in there.\n“Here’s the delivery. It’s packed in ice, so try not to get it too warm if possible. You know where Magnolia’s house is. They’ll be expecting you.”\nPersua stomps her foot angrily as I put the large metal canister in my backpack. Cold. And it is wrapped with melting ice, so I’ll have a wet backpack after my run. But it’s worth it to see her get mad.\n“\nI\ndon’t think this is a good idea.”\n“Good for you.”\nIf looks could kill…but Persua’s looks only annoy. She stomps towards me until my nose burns with her stupid perfume. She hisses at me.\n“You’ll regret this.”\n“Oh, really?”\n“Yes!”\nSome people. I turn away from Persua and hear her make a sound like an angry hamster. Claudeil, Toriska, both are giving me what they probably think are sinister looks. I look around and see most of the Street Runners pretending not to see this altercation.\nWhatever. I really don’t care about their opinions or whatever Runner’s Code they claim. I’m here to do my job.\nI nod to the receptionist.\n“I’m off.”\nI’m out the door before Persua can make another comment. I hear a strangled scream of fury, then a barrage of complaints. You can’t tell, and I don’t have a mirror.\nBut I’m grinning again.",

    "text": "This time, it’s the head maid who opens the door. She sniffs down at me.\nI nod at her. I’m out of breath, tired, and my back is really,\nreally\ncold. But I feel great, because I made it here in just forty minutes. That’s almost a record, and it’s at least twice as fast as Persua’s best time.\n“Delivery for Magnolia.”\n“That’s\nLady\nMagnolia, Miss Ryoka Griffin. Wipe your feet.”\nNow here’s someone whose looks can really kill. I shrug and take off my pack. I do wipe my feet again.\n“Seal?”\n“Wait.”\nThe head maid closes the door on me as I wrestle with my damp delivery. Well, looks like I won’t be talking to Magnolia today. That’s actually a relief. I don’t mind the bubbly, excitable noblewoman, but I actually prefer the maids. They might be abrupt and rude, but that means less talking.\nOkay, icy package is in my hands. I wait as patiently as I can outside the door and then hear a muffled conversation. It sounds like someone arguing, and then I hear a familiar energetic voice.\n“Nonsense! Ressa, how could you—of course I insist you let her in! Dirty feet or not!”\nThe door opens, and a familiar woman greets me. How can one woman’s hair stay that curly? I’m fairly certain they don’t have hair curlers in this day and age, but Magnolia’s blonde locks look as stylized as any I’ve seen from my world.\n“Please, allow me to apologize for my servant’s rudeness. Come in, please!”\nI hesitate, and the maid—Ressa—standing behind Magnolia looks unhappy.\n“I can just deliver the package if you have the seal—”\n“Oh, I won’t hear of it! Come in!”\nRessa makes a face, and I try not to. Reluctantly, I walk into the foyer of Lady Magnolia’s mansion and wish there was a rug to wipe my feet on. Magnolia beams at me while Ressa perfects her death-glare behind her back. I’m pretty sure she doesn’t want my dirty feet walking all over the marble floor. I’d prefer not to be here too, but the delivery isn’t done until I get the seal.\n“This way, please. You can put it in the drawing room. No, not the secondary one, Ressa. The main one!”\nShe leads me into a carpeted room. Again, I hesitate, but there’s no helping it. The rug is\nvery\nsoft, and my feet are\nvery\ndirty, but Magnolia doesn’t care. She peers excitedly at the metal container burning my hands with frost and dripping onto the carpet and beams at me.\n“Oh my, that was\nquick!\nI was told this would be travelling the entire way from the port city of Hazenbrad! Did you bring it here yourself?”\n“No. Other runners brought it most of the way.”\n“Well, you and your people have certainly done me quite a service! Thank you! My, you look exhausted. Won’t you take a shot of stamina potion? You’re not supposed to mix it with anything—terrible effects, alchemy, you know, but you can chase it with a drink. I find a lemonade works. But perhaps you’re busy? I did remember this time to have my seal ready!”\nMagnolia presents me with her silver-sapphire seal. I’m actually gratified she remembers, and she looks me up and down.\n“It’s Ryoko, isn’t it? It’s rare that I see the same Runner in so many days.”\nRyoka\n. But I’m used to people mispronouncing the name. I take the seal and slip it into my pouch. Right, now how to get out of this place tactfully?\n“I’ve got to go. More deliveries.”\nActually, I don’t have any more, and I’m tired. But I’d rather go to sleep now and deal with annoying jealous Runners tomorrow. Magnolia’s face falls. She glances at Ressa, who looks amused for some reason, and flutters her hands at the couch.\n“Oh, but won’t you stay? I’d love to share this delightful treat with you—and you’ve run so far and so quickly too! When I heard a Runner was setting out from Wales*, I was sure it would take at\nleast\nan hour for you to get here!”\n*Yeah, that’s the city I left. Wales. It’s odd that it has the same name as a country from my world, but then again…it’s not. There’s only so many words in the English language after all.\n“Mm.”\nAgain, what\ndo\nyou say to something like that? ‘Yeah, I’m awesome, now give me more money?’ This is why I hate talking to people. However, Magnolia just peers at me and then claps her hands as if she’s recalling something else.\n“And you look so tired! Did you do another delivery today? You Runners are out and about! Wales, Wales…I say, are you the one who bailed the Horns of Hammerad out of their predicament? I was wondering which brave Runner actually ran into a battle, and I will just\nbet\nit’s you!”\nThat makes me start. I blink and look at the woman.\n“The Horns? They made it?”\nMagnolia Reinhart smiles and gestures to her couch again. It’s\npink.\nWho makes pink couches?\n“They did indeed. Did you leave before the battle ended? I’m told they slew a Lich and a horde of undead. Found very little, but the bounty on a Lich is quite high, and I imagine if it was wearing any artifacts, they got those too. It sounded like they were returning to Wales for the day.”\n“I…that’s great. How did you know?”\nEven I hadn’t heard of that by the time I returned to the Runner’s Guild. Magnolia beams as I sit, and she indicates Ressa.\n“Oh, I do keep up with the local adventurers and their exploits. It pays to be informed, you know, and I was quite concerned when I heard they were in danger. And you were there! You must tell me about it. I insist. Ressa, the potion and some lemonade for Miss Ryoka!”\nAnd suddenly, I’m trapped. Ressa gives her mistress an exasperated look, but she steps back. Magnolia seats herself on another pink duvet across from me and keeps on chattering on as I eye the canister of metal that one of her [Butlers] or something is slowly prizing open.\n“Besides which, I was never able to talk properly with you both times before now. I truly would love to converse with you—and ask about your peculiar choice of footwear, or should I say, its lack! Won’t you stay for a while?”\nMagnolia entreats me with her eyes, and Ressa the maid gives me a look that says I should do whatever she wants and stop sweating and getting the carpets dirty while I’m at it. She’s already back with a shot glass of red liquid followed by lemonade. I take both, swallow the horrible stamina potion—and feel myself perk right up.\nWow.\nBut as I sip the lemonade, my heart sinks. Now I have to be polite. But then again—she did tell me the Horns survived.\nI hesitate. I’m tired, and I don’t feel like talking. Like always. True, Magnolia is better than Persua any day of the week, but her enthusiasm makes\nme\nfeel tired. So I stand and edge towards the door.\n“I’m sorry, but I really should go. I’m very busy.”\nMagnolia smiles at me.\n“Are you that eager to be away? You may simply tell me if you don’t wish to converse.”\nI jump* and stare at her. Magnolia smiles.\n*Well, not literally.\n“Really, my dear. It’s written all over your face. But besides that, I am a [Lady], and most of us learn [Sense Intentions] quite early. And I am quite high-level at that. So, therefore,\nsit.\n”\nI sit. I don’t even think about it. She spoke, and I—okay, that was something else. Her voice suddenly had something in it, like it was speaking in my mind. Magnolia sighs.\n“I am seldom so straightforwards, but I would like to talk with you. And you are so flighty, Miss Ryoka Griffin! It is rare that I meet a young lady as interesting as yourself.”\nTry to stand up. No? Okay legs, I’m your boss. Stand.\nStand\n.\nMagnolia gestures to the couch I’m trapped in.\n“Please sit here. I would like to share this delivery you’ve worked so hard to bring me.”\nI’m still struggling with my unresponsive body. Magnolia gives me another smile and addresses her hovering maid.\n“Ressa? Please be so kind as to open up the delivery? And I believe we will need two bowls and silverware. I would like the blue porcelain today.”\n“Very good, milady. I’m sure the color will detract from the quantity you intend to gobble down like a pig for slaughter.”\nI choke on my lemonade.\nDid I just hear that?\nMagnolia shoots Ressa a quick glare, but not outraged, like I’d assume. She shoes Ressa off, and the woman gives me a silent, warning look. Probably to tell me to behave, and she disappears out the door. She’s probably going for reinforcement maids. And that leaves me with Magnolia.\nThe larger woman gives me another charming smile. For the first time, I eye her, and not just as a rich, silly lady. Sure, she looks like something of a stereotype with her bright clothing and expensive jewelry and unambiguously good-natured personality, but what the hell did she do to me? Is that a Skill?\nShe looks like your image of a valedictorian [Lady] in the modern era. Charming, trendy, and I assumed, mostly fixated on fashion and…noble, rich person stuff. Which I am acquainted with via my family. All show, little substance, lots of drama.\nBut she knew about the Horns, and her Skill is still locking me in my seat.\n“I do hope you like sweet things, Miss Ryoka. Forgive my rudeness, but I simply find that sometimes it’s best to pin people down and get to know them, don’t you?”\n“Mm.”\n“I’m so glad you agree! My, between you and Ressa, I am simply spoilt for fine conversation, aren’t I?”\nNow, that.\nThat\nsounded a bit like sarcasm. Well, well. Looks like Magnolia has layers. Or her petticoat does. Looks like I’ve underestimated her.\n“Well, continue sitting there for a moment. I simply must try this delight, although I fear it’s rather ruining the carpet. Ah, well, it was due for a change.”\nMagnolia bustles out of the room. I try to run for it, but my legs are still unresponsive. Well, damn. She’s got some power. It might be worth talking with her after all.\nMagnolia. What an aggressive, pushy lady.\nI think I like her.",

    "text": "Lady Magnolia fussed around the drawing room, and her maids fussed after her. She was busy overseeing the opening of a large metal cask, the contents of which had been surrounded in ice.\nRyoka sat in front of one ornately wrought table, conscious of her dirty feet on the rug. It might not have been Persian, but that was only because Persia didn’t exist in this world. It was certainly expensive, and it was certainly getting dirty the longer her feet were on it.\nOccasionally, Ryoka’s legs would tense, but she remained sitting, much to her vexation.\n“And here we are!”\nMagnolia clapped her hands together in delight. Ryoka glanced up as the two latches on the metal canister were undone and icy vapor escaped. She had no idea what she’d brought, and so it was with interest that she saw a maid carefully scoop something out of the canister.\nIt was…white, wet-looking, with a few dark flecks mixed in the creamy color. Magnolia’s eye sparkled as another scoop was transferred to a blue and white porcelain bowl. Even the maids looked covetously at the soft cream.\nTo be specific, the soft\nice cream\n.\nRyoka stared. Magnolia’s smile intensified, but the stare was not because Ryoka was taken with the novelty of the unheard of, expensive treat that she would have never eaten before. That was Magnolia’s one error.\nThe [Lady] gestured towards her guest, and the maid hesitated before setting the bowl down in front of Ryoka. The young woman stared silently at the gold filigree on the spoon she was handed. She stared down at the ice cream.\n“Now, this is quite a treat.”\nOne of the maids pulled a chair out for Lady Magnolia, and the noblewoman sat across from Ryoka. She accepted another bowl and smiled at Ryoka.\n“Don’t be afraid. This is in fact a very rare delicacy I had imported. It’s quite,\nquite\nexpensive, but once you try it, I think you’ll agree it’s worth the cost. And I was sure a fast Runner would take it to me! I would have been so…disappointed if it was late.”\nRyoka hesitated. That sounded like she had really bailed Persua out of trouble, but she was still flummoxed by the appearance of the ice cream. She wasn’t sure if she should eat first, but Magnolia waved one hand at her.\n“Oh, go on. What kind of host would I be if I did not allow you the first bite? I must warn you, though—it’s quite cold! Eat too fast and you will suffer, as I’ve learned.”\nRyoka hesitated, but Lady Magnolia was staring at her with earnest expectation. That was in sharp contrast to the maids behind her, who were all giving Ryoka the glare of death. She had the distinct impression refusing would not end well for her.\nPrompted by all the eyes on her, Ryoka slowly took a bite. Her expression didn’t change one iota. Lady Magnolia blinked. The maids would have muttered, but their training kept their faces carefully neutral.\n“Huh. Ice cream.”\nRyoka paused and cursed inwardly. She hadn’t meant to say that out loud. Again, Magnolia blinked at her, and her mouth fell open delicately.\n“My. You know what this is?”\n“…No?”\nMagnolia’s eyes sharpened, and she stopped with a huge spoonful of ice cream. She delicately took a bite, then sighed.\n“My dear, remember what I said about my Skills? I know you’re lying. But how can that be? I would swear that this delight hasn’t been invented but for a week! I just heard it had been created by a master [Chef] in the northern continent. But you’ve had some before, haven’t you?”\nShe could tell the truth, or she could lie and reveal the truth. Ryoka shrugged.\n“Yeah.”\nThe maids murmured. Magnolia sighed and tasted the ice cream herself.\n“Delicious. Oh, but pardon me. I couldn’t help myself. Well, this is one surprise that quite trumps my surprise! I must say, I’m rather put out and delighted that you know this treat. What did you call it? ‘Ice cream’?”\n“Is it called something else around here?”\n“I believe it was referred to as ‘gelato’ or some such. But I rather like your name! It certainly is quite reminiscent of cream, isn’t it? But the coldness—and of course the sweetness is incomparable!”\n“Mhm.”\nNow, Ryoka was sweating. Magnolia leaned over, but Ryoka was astounded at how fast she ate the ice cream. No wonder she got a brain freeze!\n“Well, now you simply\nmust\ntell me how you know of this treat.”\n“Uh, it’s common in my home country.”\nMagnolia raised her delicate eyebrows.\n“Common? It is not in Drath, I assure you. Surely you—but you\nare\ntelling the truth. How curious.”\nRyoka shifted in her seat. This was bad. She felt like her mind was being read. Well, even if it were just her intentions and whether or not she was telling the truth, there were enough landmines in the conversation to fill a battlefield. She had to shift the conversation.\nGingerly, she took another bite. The ice cream wasn’t actually as sweet as one from her world, but it was hauntingly familiar. She pointed to the melting canister.\n“Uh, how much did this cost?”\nThat wasn’t an appropriate question to judge by the glares she got from the maids. But Magnolia seemed to take the question in stride.\n“Well, I hate to bring up such issues in polite conversation, but this little treat cost seventy gold coins, not including the cost of shipping it across the sea and rushing it all the way here.”\nRyoka choked on her bite of ice cream and nearly bit the spoon in half. Magnolia waved a hand at her.\n“Oh, please. I know it’s a lot, but for a treat like this? Very worthwhile.”\n“So worthwhile you could not eat two bowls.”\nRessa muttered out of the corner of her mouth. Ryoka stared down and saw Magnolia\nwas\nalready getting a refill, and they weren’t small bowls. Magnolia sighed.\n“Ressa, you’re right. Of course.”\n“I am?”\nThe [Maid] looked caught off-guard, and Magnolia clicked her fingers lightly.\n“I must make this batch last. I shall have some cherries, raspberries, and strawberries in my bowl. Delightfully sweet. Will you have any, Ryoka?”\nNone of those fruits were in season, but Ryoka had no doubt Magnolia had a stockpile. She shook her head as the fruits appeared within a minute and were ladled into the bowl.\nThat was an entire lunch in and of itself.\nBut Magnolia simply picked up her spoon in delight as Ressa gave her the look of someone watching a truly horrific act of consumption.\nSilently, Ryoka stared at the canister of ice cream. It was probably, when all was said and done, the size of a tub of ice cream she could have bought for three dollars in any supermarket in her world.\nIn this world, seventy gold pieces was about seventy\nweeks\nof pay for the average person. And Ryoka just bet that the ‘shipping’ and rush delivery might have doubled the price. If it was overseas? She didn’t want to think about it.\nOblivious to her inner thoughts, Magnolia smiled again at Ryoka as she delicately spooned more ice cream into her mouth.\n“I fear we must eat quickly before our ‘ice cream’ melts. But I’m sure we could chat over tea as well. And then you can tell me about how you know of this ice cream and where you come from. I must say, your features are quite striking.”\nRyoka’s expression didn’t change, but Magnolia’s eyes flickered.\n“Well, if you don’t prefer to say, I quite understand. But I would like to chat.”\nThis was hard. Ryoka frowned at her mostly melted ice cream and thought carefully. She was looking for something to distract from the topic of where she was from, and she had nothing…until an idea formed. Then she looked up. Magnolia’s smile grew even wider. She was a third through her bowl! Ryoka glanced at her rapidly moving spoon.\n“Aah. I mean…I could talk about one thing.”\nMagnolia’s eyes twinkled with anticipation.\n“Oh? I know it’s terribly rude to point out what you’re thinking, but that was quite the inspiration you just had.”\n“Yeah. I was just thinking about the ice cream.”\n“Would you like another scoop? We could all have a third bowl.”\nMagnolia instantly offered Ryoka more, and Ressa and both [Maids] shook their heads behind her. Ryoka bit her tongue, amused despite herself, and glanced at Magnolia.\n“No. But I do know a lot about it. Ice cream, that is.”\n“Really? You are a fan or familiar with the recipe? I’m afraid I wasn’t able to learn anything about what creature produces such a delightful treat. Or how it was made! Do you know where it comes from? I have a small culinary bounty for my [Chefs] to replicate it because I love it so. Any hints I will be sure to reward!”\nMagnolia leaned forwards in excitement. Ryoka looked down her bosom and felt like she understood part of the attraction of visiting Magnolia. At least, the attraction for some City Runners. She smiled, once, hesitantly, not the wild grin of someone running. But she did smile, and that was the first step.\n“Better. I know how to make it.”\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "They called her the Deadly Flower Blooming in the North. Which was…a mouthful of a title. After her first meeting with Magnolia Reinhart, Ryoka Griffin had asked who, exactly, she was.\n‘Head of the Reinhart Family,’ was her answer. Which begged the question what that meant. The Reinharts were one of the Five Families. Well, what did\nthat\nmean?\nThey were called the Five Families of Izril, and she was the scion of her family. Not the matriarch, but the one who was in control.\nMagnolia Reinhart.\nThis was the woman who bounced on her tip-toes with excitement and opened doors by herself. And who Ryoka Griffin had snarked.\nShe looked nothing like what Ryoka imagined. She was blonde-haired, the tips slightly curling and cut short, and she was neither as tall as Ryoka and Ressa nor half as fit as either one.\nThen again, Ryoka Griffin realized how strong Ressa might be when the woman took the canister of ice-cream. It was still half-full and packed with now-melted icewater. The entire thing was a lump of steel. It had to weigh, oh, ten, fifteen pounds at least? It certainly had weighed Ryoka down on the run here, but her pack had been balanced.\nNo way Persua would have made it. Ressa tossed it up one-handed like someone catching a football, then\nflicked\nit sideways at a man in a butler’s costume.\nRyoka stared as the [Maids] led her to the kitchen. Anyone could toss a fifteen pound weight around, but she had never seen someone\nflick\nsomething like that with their fingertips.\nLest Ryoka think the canister had gotten magically lighter, the poor butler caught the canister with both hands like it was a load of bricks and staggered slightly. He almost fell until a [Maid] caught his arm.\nRessa politely gestured.\n“This way to the kitchen, Miss.”\nShe ignored Ryoka’s look as Magnolia clapped her hands together. The [Lady] was indeed nowhere near as tall or even as lanky as Ressa. And Ressa herself was tall, thin, precise—\nsevere\nmight fit her demeanor.\nAlthough the word\ndangerous\nsuddenly popped into Ryoka’s head as she stared at Ressa longer. She couldn’t have said why, exactly. Why did you think that when you stared at a grinning hyena? Ressa wasn’t smiling nor was she showing any fangs. But the word still appeared for the same reason.\nNor was Magnolia half as heavy as someone who ate that much ice cream—apparently on a daily basis—should be, in Ryoka’s mind. She was actually just—normal. She had the\nfaintest\nof scars on her chin, barely visible, a nick, really, and a penchant for pink, like her dress and even a sofa.\nWhat made Magnolia Reinhart earn a second glance, or third, were her eyes. Like Ryoka’s, they were green, but more like a forest: darker, less vibrant, and wholly impenetrable if you tried to find out what she was thinking. The pattern in her irises were actually reminiscent of tree branches themselves, waving and dancing.\nThey would crinkle with mirth or dance from object to object, but those eyes seemed to make untruths harder around them. And there was one more thing that Ryoka saw, which compounded something she’d heard of Magnolia.\nHer gaze seemed very, very distant. Ryoka had often seen superior expressions. Her father hosted such people, often friends of his, quite a lot. She had seen arrogance, sometimes in the mirror.\nNever once had she seen—the\ndistance\nin Magnolia Reinhart’s gaze. Not as if she were above but watching from afar. Even when she was up close, it was like she was staring at something far away.\nA great, distant goal, like the very mountains in the distance. Thoughtfully—until she noticed you watching.\nThen she smiled and winked at Ryoka Griffin. And that look disappeared into merry mischief.\n“Do pardon Ressa. She’s grumpy, but a family servant. Which means she takes\nall\nthe liberties. I wouldn’t have it any other way. To the kitchens! Oh dear, I hope this one is well stocked. This is my vacation home in Celum, you see.”\n“You have a lot of homes, then, Lady Reinhart?”\nRyoka trailed after Ressa as the woman and a bevy of servants headed down the halls of this place. Ryoka supposed it was ‘small’ for someone as important as Magnolia seemed to be—but she passed through a foyer with\nthree\nstories. Yet Magnolia Reinhart just sighed.\n“I have a more permanent residence in Invrisil, but travel takes me everywhere. I have a number of residences, oh, all over the north.”\n“Nowhere in the south?”\nRyoka realized she’d made a mistake a second after she said that. Ressa turned her head back, and Magnolia laughed until she realized Ryoka was serious.\n“The south? Oh, no, the Drakes would never tolerate\nmy kind\nthat far south. Nor would I if I was them. You know the saying, ‘better a serpent in bed than a Reinhart.’ Which is terribly hurtful and entirely accurate.”\nShe had a grand chuckle at this, and Ryoka hesitated. She felt like running away already, but she had offered to make ice cream. So she saw Magnolia catch her breath.\n“—But you truly aren’t from Izril, Miss Ryoka. The north has a\nstrained\nrelationship with the south, which I think you should bear in mind if ever you go past Esthelm and deliver to a Drake city. Not that there’s anywhere safe but Liscor. Unless the Bloodfields have opened up, Ressa?”\nBloodfields?\nWhat the heck was\nthat?\nRyoka glanced at the [Maid], and Ressa replied.\n“Not until the first frosts, Lady Reinhart. In here, Miss Griffin. What will you be needing?”\nShe showed Ryoka into a huge kitchen, and the young woman hesitated.\n“Oh, just a few things. A pot, uh, something to stir with, and—”\nThen she realized Magnolia Reinhart was following her into the kitchen. Ryoka gulped, but the [Lady] just fluttered her hands and clasped them together.\n“Don’t mind me! I’ll just watch if that’s acceptable. I\ndo\nadmire good cookery. I had lessons, but it never stuck. Imagine it, making gelato! I’ll be the talk of Izril.”\nSome days were odd days. Some days you ran, and some days you found yourself in another world with nothing but an iPhone and the clothes on your back. Some days you made ice cream.\nBut it was a rare day that Ryoka found herself making ice cream in a noblewoman’s house, surrounded by maids, in a kitchen that could have rivaled any cooking show’s setup for expense and expensive things.\nShe felt out of place in the spotless room, handling the equivalent of stainless steel cooking utensils. They weren’t stainless, but they\nwere\nsteel—and a lot had expensive handles or were magical. Ryoka was still barefoot, and she was painfully conscious of how her feet were dirtying the flawless floor tiling. Not that Lady Magnolia seemed to mind.\nThe beaming lady of the mansion hovered around Ryoka, excitedly showing her the contents of the amply-stocked kitchen.\n“Help yourself to anything you need, Miss Griffin! Oh, but watch out. That knife is hot.”\nIt\nwas!\nRyoka nearly put it back in the block of wood as the red handle warmed up.\n“How the—”\n“A heating knife. I think you use it to slice meat or…you know, I don’t cook. Ressa, are there [Chefs] here?”\n“No, Lady Reinhart, the staff has accommodated your every need without the expense of a live-in [Chef] for your Celum home. That knife is meant to sear what it cuts. These are regular knives, Miss Griffin.”\nOkay,\nmagical\ncutlery. Ryoka put the knife back, and Magnolia bustled around, mostly getting in the way of Ressa, who was pulling out what Ryoka asked for.\n“What do we have here? Oh my! We do have a full pantry! Do you need any of this, Miss Griffin?”\nShe opened pantry doors and revealed shelf after shelf of exotic ingredients that Ryoka half-recognized. Sugar, okay, that made sense. But red sugar? Harvested from the desert? And that was normal compared to delicacies like Wyvern meat. She pointed at a\nslab\nof purplish meat in what must have been an enchanted space to keep it fresh.\n“Far too tough for me. I tried it once but couldn’t bear the taste of it. It’s very healthy, or so I’m told but…what does this ice cream need?”\n“Uh—sugar.”\n“Crimson sugar or regular sugar? Nali-sticks?”\n“What are those?”\nMagnolia glanced up.\n“Oh, a Balerosian treat. Akin to concentrated sugar, I believe. Well, we have regular sugar—I import the stuff, you know. I have a little deal with an [Admiral] about shipping it.”\nNow\nthat\nsounded like an important person talking. Ryoka just stared before she saw Ressa plonk a regular bag of sugar on the table. Reminded of her task, Ryoka got back to work, trying to remember what she needed.\nThe oddness of the kitchen wasn’t that it was so grand or had so many equivalents to modern cooking equipment. No, it was that most of the food storage in the kitchen consisted of shelves of food left out in the open. And even in the pantry, items like milk, butter, and even fresh vegetables had been neatly stockpiled away without any kind of refrigeration.\nThere was no helping it. Ryoka had to ask. She cut off Lady Magnolia as the other woman began talking about a strange jello that looked like it was moving.\n“Doesn’t all this rot?”\nMagnolia glanced at the shelves of uncovered food while the maids following her gave Ryoka silent glares.\n“This? I shouldn’t think so. I paid for the best preservation spells, and I have an [Enchanter] come by every year or so to make sure the runes are holding. My people are quite pleased with all the space, which I do need for all the delightful treats I order.”\nRyoka stared at the tiny etched runes on the side of each cupboard. They were in no language she knew. Preservation runes? Well, that was handy. She wondered just how expensive they were.\n“Not too expensive, at least for the quality of work done. Mages charge very affordable prices. I gather most inns and some of the larger shops use such runes quite often.”\nLady Magnolia smiled as Ryoka’s head shot up and the younger woman looked at her.\n“Not mind reading my dear. Just an educated guess and a few Skills. I’m sure you’ve heard it said that it is a frivolous class, but [Ladies] have a few useful tricks in social situations. You do scream disapproval now and then.”\n“Mm.”\nWait, she could tell when Ryoka was annoyed?\nThe City Runner began to sweat, and Magnolia clapped her hands before waving them to reassure her.\n“Please don’t grow alarmed! Or take offense. Oh my, you are quite taciturn, aren’t you? Dragons should be more forthcoming! Please, I will stop bothering you, but let us make this ice cream! How shall we begin?”\nMagnolia waited excitedly as Ryoka looked around the room and tried to remember all of the ingredients. It had been a long time since Ryoka made ice cream. She’d almost forgotten how, but as a child—\n“We need some salt too. A pinch of it. And vanilla.”\n“Of course. Ressa?”\nThe head maid nodded and directed her maids to the appropriate shelves. She paused as one maid brought her a bundle of wrapped vanilla bean stalks.\n“They are\nquite\nexpensive, milady.”\nLady Magnolia\npshed\nand waved at Ressa impatiently.\n“Oh, nonsense, Ressa, don’t be a spoilsport. I’m minded to give Ryoka anything she wants if she can make this ice cream.”\n“One stalk is fine.”\nRyoka accepted the dry, stick-like piece of vanilla from the glowering maid and broke it open. She sniffed at the strong smell and began extracting the beans from within.\n“Now we need to heat the milk, salt, and sugar together in a pot. Got a big one?”\nLady Magnolia clapped her hands together as Ressa glowered and found a large, polished pot and set it over one of the kitchen stoves. She started the fire underneath the pot with a single touch to a glowing red rune on the stove front.\n“Oh, I see! You’re making a custard! How delightful!”\nSilently, Ryoka mixed the ingredients together and created a creamy, off-white custard in the pot. She poked at it with her spoon and decided it was thick enough for ice cream. What next? Oh, right.\n“…Crap.”\nThis time, Ryoka’s language nearly earned her a slap on the back of the head. Ressa’s hand\ntwitched\n, and a small vein began to throb on her forehead.\n“What’s wrong?”\n“I might not be able to make this after all. I forgot something.”\nLady Magnolia looked dismayed. She peered into the pot.\n“It looks perfectly fine to me, but—is there an ingredient missing?”\nRyoka shook her head. She gestured at the pot.\n“We need to freeze this. Or rather, we need to freeze it slowly while stirring.”\nThat was a big problem. For all this world had things like preservation spells, Ryoka was sure they hadn’t invented freezers or air-conditioning. But to her surprise, Lady Magnolia laughed and put her hand over her ample bosom in relief.\n“Oh, is that all?”\nMagnolia waved an airy hand. She turned to another one of her maids.\n“Yvony, would you be a dear and send a message to the Mage’s Guild? Tell them I need an [Elementalist] mage capable of using basic ice magic.”\nBemused, Ryoka watched as Yvony, a fair-haired maid with fairer complexion, bowed and quickly trotted out of the room.\n“Is she going to run there?”\nLady Magnolia chuckled politely, and the other maids smiled.\n“We are not all as fleet-footed as you Runners. No, she’s just here to bring me—ah, thank you Yvony.”\nThe maid had returned with a small, blue book with gold lattice work on the cover. Lady Magnolia opened it and showed Ryoka the blank pages as Yvony unscrewed an ink pot and dipped a quill in it.\n“If you will observe, this is a magical book. One of two, in fact. Whenever one writes on one page, the other book immediately copies over the same writing. It’s quite the ingenious way of talking without needing to cast a [Message] or [Communication] spell each time.”\nShe handed the book to Yvony as the maid wrote a few brisk, short lines on the paper. The book glowed once, and then the light faded from the pages. Magnolia clapped her hands together and turned to Ryoka.\n“And now we wait. A [Mage] should be along in a matter of minutes. The Mage’s Guild is quite prompt at responding, and happily, they are located only a few streets away. Shall we retire for a cup of tea?”\nGiven her choice, Ryoka would have refused, but the thing about a request made by a lady is that it is not really a request. In short order, she found herself sitting and sipping from a hot cup of tea and trying not to make a face.\nHer heritage as a Japanese-American said that she should at least appreciate good tea, as Ryoka had Japanese grandparents who insisted she try the stuff. But her American roots and personality insisted coffee was the only way to live. Sadly, she hadn’t encountered that beverage here yet, so she pretended to drink her tea while Magnolia seated herself in the guest room on the pink sofa again.\n“Sugar?”\nOnce again, she surprised Ryoka by offering her a bowl of sugar herself. Ryoka passed it up—then saw to her mild horror Magnolia repeating the same trick as she had over the ice cream.\nNamely—she took the lid off the bowl, and ignoring the spoon, poured a fourth of it into her cup. Ressa’s face was blank as Ryoka saw Magnolia stir.\n“You, uh—like sugar a lot, don’t you?”\n“It is one of life’s pleasures. Now, a snack. Ressa! How about some baked Yellats? Are you a fan of them, Miss Griffin?”\n“I’ve never had any.”\n“Really? They are a quite common food across Chandrar, the desert continent, you know. Some people consider them as plebian as potatoes, but I find them delightfully good in any number of dishes. Spicy, too. Ah, here we are.”\nRyoka was served some hot, steaming root or starch vegetables. They were almost as orange as carrots, but more resembled broccoli. They had the texture of sweet potatoes, but they were indeed\nspicy!\nMagnolia nibbled on one as Ryoka found they were good enough to eat. Ressa walked off as Yvony came back, and the butler hovered around with a tray as Magnolia kept speaking.\n“I must say, I have been absolutely\ndying\nto know what it is that makes you run, Miss Ryoka. If I may confess—I’m not asking you solely out of pure interest as well. I have a teensy bet going on with some other ladies in my gossip circle about it. I told them I had heard of a City Runner running barefoot, and they all\nassured",

    "text": "me none of them had heard of anything like it! They live all abouts, you see. North, northeast, northwest—Celum is too far south for most of the nobility to live.”\nRyoka paused. She was used to attention for running barefoot, but this was the first time she’d ever been bet on.\n“Really? It’s that fascinating to you? Um, Lady Magnolia?”\nThe [Lady] covered her mouth with a hand as she laughed.\n“Why, haven’t you realized what a splash you’ve made? A young woman becomes the fastest local Runner practically overnight? Yet alone running barefoot? People are wondering why you run barefoot. Is it part of a special class? Or is it a secret?”\n“No secret.”\nMagnolia waited, but the young woman sitting across from her said nothing more. She cleared her throat politely.\n“Then—would you mind telling me? I would simply love to know.”\nLady Magnolia leaned forwards over her tea eagerly. Even the maids were quietly listening as they bustled around the drawing room performing menial and unneeded tasks.\nRyoka shrugged.\n“I just like running barefoot. I hate shoes.”\nHer audience blinked at her. Ryoka shrugged. There wasn’t much more to say. She eyed the maids as they shifted and exchanged glances behind their mistress’ back. Idly, Ryoka wondered how much gossiping they did when they were done with work.\nSilence followed Ryoka’s answer, which was then broken by laughter. Lady Magnolia chuckled and then laughed quietly. It wasn’t boisterous or uncontrolled; like everything else about her, it was polite and refined. But it was genuine.\n“You, my dear Ryoka Griffin, are the most delightful young lady I have ever met! You give away nothing.”\nShe lifted her cup, and a waiting maid filled it with the dark brown tea that Ryoka was trying not to ingest.\n“Ah, well. A simple answer, but not from a simple person. I suppose our little gossip circle will have to annul the bet. How interesting. But then, to be fair, I’m told half-Elves do eschew shoes all the time. Did you learn that from them?”\n“Nope. I’m not—acquainted with half-Elves that much. It’s just a hobby. It’s good for your feet. Sort of.”\nRyoka was proud of her reply. She knew that half-Elves\nexisted\n, but she had only seen one while delivering all those potions to the adventurers. She did want to meet them, and Magnolia shook her head.\n“Well, I cannot imagine how you don’t poke holes in your feet like that. And you are so fit! Did you ever think of joining a [Knight] order?”\n“I’m not big on law enforcement.”\nTruer words had never been spoken. Magnolia laughed at that uproariously and shook her head.\n“Then have you run like that all your life?”\n“All the time.”\n“Indoors and outdoors?”\n“Yep.”\nMagnolia Reinhart put her chin in her hand. Ryoka hoped at this point the [Lady] would leave her alone. She had been the most uncooperative, inhospitable guest she could imagine, and anyone else would have surely thrown her out on her head. But Magnolia either wanted ice cream that badly or something else was going on.\nThe latter turned out to be true, because the [Lady]’s eyes lit up and she clapped her hands together with a sigh.\n“\nFascinating.\nYou know, I’m completely stumped. Ressa, do you have a guess?”\nShe turned, and Ryoka jumped as she saw Ressa appear with the tea kettle in hand. The [Maid] had entered the room, and she bowed.\n“I’m out. Either she was lying—and I had a truth spell on her the entire time—or it’s somewhere you missed, like a paradise nation.”\nHm?\nWhat did that mean? Ryoka felt a moment of uncertainty as Magnolia nodded.\n“Not Izril, Baleros, Chandrar, Terandria—well, maybe the Kingdom of Keys or somewhere new like…? Taimaguros? But she would know [Knights]. Wistram’s rare children know magic, and no one would be allowed to run around barefoot in Drath, the likeliest option, because of how rude that would be. Nor on Rhir for safety. And Izril? I am stumped.”\nRyoka Griffin’s blank look began to turn more and more alarmed as Magnolia began reciting names. Names which Ryoka Griffin vaguely recognized as every major landmass in the entire world. Magnolia Reinhart beamed at Ryoka, and Ressa stared at the now-nervous City Runner.\n“For all the money, then, Miss Griffin. Do the seas carry you home? A [Storm Sailor] or one of the Drowned Folk might walk a deck barefoot.”\nRyoka Griffin hesitated. And she opened her mouth to say something, before she realized—\nDid that woman, Ressa, say\ntruth spells?\nShe had no idea what the Drowned Folk were, but if she said yes, she lied. If she said no…\nMagnolia Reinhart kept that gaze on Ryoka, and that distant look in her eyes—was suddenly gone. Then, two green irises stared at Ryoka, and the young woman felt like she was engulfed in a forest of green. A watchful forest, and Magnolia was suddenly\nthere\n, and the young woman saw the real [Lady].\nThe Deadly Flower Blooming in the North smiled and chuckled as someone knocked on the door. The [Mage] had come.\n“Just a joke, Miss Griffin. I know you didn’t come from a ship. Or else someone would have known you from a port city. Well, I am stumped, and I thought I was playing the guessing-game well. That should be our [Mage].\nNow for ice cream!\n”\nShe shot to her feet and headed to the door with alacrity. Ryoka, though, stopped a moment and glanced at Ressa. The [Maid] smiled at her, and Ryoka had to ask a question.\n“Is…I heard she’s the hero of some kind of war.”\nThe [Maid]’s smile vanished in a second. She gave Ryoka a long, long look, and the City Runner realized she might have made another mistake. But Ressa just dipped her head.\n“The Antinium Wars? Those are ancient history. She was no hero, the kind you’ll see in statues. But she was.”\nRyoka expected Ressa to follow that up with, ‘so show some respect,’ but the [Maid] just held out a hand.\n“May I take your cup, Miss?”",

    "text": "Ice cream. It tasted sweet, was hopefully cold and, apparently, was about as addictive as hardcore drugs to those who’d never had it before.\nShe hadn’t been too sure about her recipe, but at Lady Magnolia’s insistence, Ryoka had filled a huge pot with custard. After the mage had arrived and the ice cream had been successfully churned into the frozen treat with a few hiccups, Lady Magnolia, her maids, and even the mage had joined Ryoka in eating the ice cream.\nAs a result, the big pot was now empty, and Ryoka’s stomach was not happy with her. The mage had left just half an hour ago, clutching at his stomach and head. He still had a blissful smile on his face, though.\nTo Ryoka’s surprise, the mage had been quite interested in making ice cream. Perhaps that was just his personality, but it was also probably due to Magnolia’s infectious enthusiasm. She’d had a maid taking notes of Ryoka’s every action as she’d figured out how to mix the ice cream properly.\nWell, that was fine in the end because it meant that Ryoka didn’t have to explain how to make the ice cream twice. And now that the ice cream was eaten, Ryoka could finally leave. She was at the final stage of that process—trying to shake off Lady Magnolia at the door.\nThe [Lady] did not bring up Ryoka’s point of origin again, and Ryoka could almost believe that Magnolia was just a kindly [Lady] trying to\nnoblesse oblige\nto the max.\n“I still can’t believe you won’t take at least some token for teaching me this delightful recipe. Won’t you take some of it with you? To the Runner’s Guild at least. You could let them all share it. Or some gold coins? I do intend to replicate the recipe, and that will put my supplier out. Oh, and Ressa? Make a note for the [Farmers] in First Landing to grow some vanilla. Bully them gently into it. With love and kisses from me, or they’ll miss the profits in a year.”\nRyoka shrugged and tried to back out the door as Lady Magnolia fussed around her. The almost-lethal amounts of sugar the older woman had imbibed didn’t seem to be slowing her down like it had the other maids and Ryoka. Even Ressa, the faithful head maid, looked slightly ill after coming down from the sugar high and realizing how much she’d eaten, but Magnolia was as energetic and bright as ever.\n“I don’t want any ice cream, thanks. The other Runners—I’m not that chummy with them. They can eat cake. And it was just ice cream. I don’t feel right about taking the gold.”\nPlus, if Persua learned how much money Magnolia was offering her, she’d never stop complaining.\nWith a sigh, Lady Magnolia gave up on the issue, much to Ryoka’s relief.\n“If you’re sure. I suppose there’s no harm in it if it won’t aggravate things. I do know the Runners compete. How about a little gift, though? Say, a bag of holding?”\nRyoka hesitated as the maid named Ressa coughed and muttered about the expense. Did she say a bag of\nholding?\nAs in—the magical object that would hold things? That\nwas\ntempting. But again, Ryoka looked at Magnolia’s dancing green eyes and remembered that intent look.\n“…No. I’m fine, thanks.”\nLady Magnolia sighed, but she made no further arguments, much to Ryoka and her head maid’s relief. Ryoka finished stretching out the leg that had fallen asleep and then moved to open the door. Ressa intercepted her and held the door open politely. Her hands were gloved. Apparently, that made a big difference to what she could touch and Ryoka couldn’t.\nTime to run. But Ryoka turned at the door and nodded to Lady Magnolia.\n“Thanks.”\n“On the contrary, it is I who should thank you, Miss Ryoka. But if I might have one last question before you go?”\nRyoka reluctantly paused at the door as Ressa closed it in her face. She turned slightly and glanced at Magnolia.\n“Do you, in fact, come from any place in this world?”\nSilence. Ryoka’s face didn’t change, but Magnolia smiled. She looked straight at Ryoka Griffin and then nodded to Ressa. The door swung open, and Ryoka stumbled a bit as she trotted out the door. But now she was looking back over her shoulder.\n“I—”\n“I hope you will accept more requests from me in the future. I would so love to chat.”\nThe [Lady] twinkled merrily. She looked Ryoka in the eye, and the Runner inhaled. Then Ryoka was gone before Magnolia finished speaking.",

    "text": "“You scared her off. I thought you were trying to be subtle.”\nRessa closed the door as Lady Magnolia watched Ryoka Griffin running for the hills. The [Lady] turned as she dropped the smile, but she still looked amused. Then she put a hand over her chest and pretended to swoon.\nHer maid let her bounce off a wall and onto the carpet. Magnolia glared up at Ressa as Yvony and her staff dashed over to help her up.\n“…I think I’m going to have a heart-attack. Thank you for catching me incidentally, Ressa.”\n“Self-inflicted injuries are not my job. You don’t think she’s actually from somewhere else, do you?”\nRessa scoffed, and Magnolia sat up.\n“She didn’t answer, but the look in her eyes—that was a joke, Ressa. That was\nsupposed\nto be a joke. I really thought I’d hear she was from some provincial place.”\n“And you just let her run off, never to return. You didn’t even put a tracking spell on the bag of holding.”\nMagnolia stood back up and brushed at her skirts.\n“She’ll be back. Or we will find her, but I would hope she returns of her own volition, Ressa. A young woman as vivaciously intelligent as that will, even if she has all the manners and social graces of a rabid Eater Goat. If only to make excuses. I\nhope\nshe’s no runaway [Princess] or daughter of someone important. We have enough of those already.”\nShe gazed out the window and saw Ryoka Griffin was already turning down the street. Magnolia shook her head as Ressa glanced out the window.\n“My, but she\nis\nquick. Oh, and Ressa? One more thing. Get in touch with the old man.”\n“…Which old man is it? The pervert or the lazy one?”\nMagnolia scowled.\n“The one we\nlike.\nWake him up if you can. Tell him I need a favor. Tell him to look into…er…how do you spell ‘Ryoka Griffin’?”\n“I believe the Runner’s Guild has her name written down.”\n“Right. Yes. Use that.”",

I put my hand on my stomach and try not to throw up.\n“Woog.”\nIce cream is\nnot\ngood for my body, especially if I have to run. I feel like I’ve got a rock in my stomach. And yet, it might have been worth it. If only it hadn’t been vanilla,* life might have been perfect.\n*If I have to eat ice cream, it’s got to be mint chocolate chip. Vanilla is just vanilla. But I love mint. And peppermint. And spearmint. I…really wish I had some gum.\nAs I slowly walk and then transition back into a slow jog, I think about Magnolia or as I now know her, the scariest person I’ve met in this world. Apparently, someone with her class can practically read minds, or at least tell how I’m feeling. That is\nnot\na comforting thought.\nJeez. She nearly figured out where I came from in a few minutes. What a terrifyingly scary lady.\nIt might be wrong to think, but when I first met her, I thought she was just another plump social butterfly without a thought in the world. But…that’s what she wants people to assume about her. The real Magnolia is sharp and intelligent. Remember that next time you visit her.\n…Which won’t be for a while. I know there’s going to be hell to pay if Persua has her way, and besides, now\nI\nhave a good reason not to visit Magnolia in the future.\n“Right. No Magnolia deliveries for a while.”\nBut with that said, I will be doing research on her. War hero? I’ll just bet Garia knows something about her—how Magnolia got her wealth, if she was married, etc. Know your enemy, right? Well, Magnolia isn’t my enemy, and I’d like to keep her that way.\nDoes she really think I’m from another world? No—no, I should have played it off. Stupid Ryoka!\nThe last thing I need is to cause a stir. What are the dangers of talking about Earth? Gee, let me make a list. But I can pretend I was just surprised. I just need to go back once I’m ready, which means I need intelligence.\nIt’s too bad there are no libraries around. That’s medieval times for you, but at least I have a resource in a local—Garia.\n…Garia. Her name triggers a thought in my mind as I run down another street. It’s getting empty this late in the day, but I see another Street Runner disappear the instant I turn down the street. Garia. Oh. Oh yeah.\nTomorrow, I have to do that delivery with Garia. That will be a pain. Not just because we’ve got to carry fifty pounds on our backs, but because she’s going to talk to me the entire time. Which is fine. It’s a normal, Human thing to do. It’s just a pain in the ass.\nWell, I promised, so that’s that. Forget about it, but don’t actually forget about it. At least I won’t have to stick around the Runner’s Guild too long waiting for another job.\nI wonder whether there will be any consequences for making ice cream. What a ridiculous thought but…let’s explore that. Hm.\nIt probably wasn’t a good idea to share the recipe, but it made Magnolia happy, and I guess that’s better than her being upset. But what does it mean to spread that kind of information?\nWell…if I had to guess, it would mean that the poor person who invented ice cream isn’t going to be as rich as she or he hopes. But it also might mean a revolution of sorts within the city. Ice cream is exceptionally possible, and thanks to magic, easy to make even in this day and age.\nDoes that mean I might soon see it on the streets? But no—unless you have a mage on standby, ice cream isn’t easy to keep. I guess the nobility will enjoy it for the most part until someone revolutionizes the ice box or fridge. That’s the way it goes, right? Trickle-down, just like how the ice cream cone melts.\nI get that far in my reasoning when I notice the other runners.\nAs I’m jogging down one of Celum’s streets, I notice a few people keeping pace. I’m not going full-tilt with pedestrians, and so I see a lanky stride and turn my head. I blink as a familiar face appears.\nClaudeil. He looks busy, running ahead of me; I’m catching up to him. What’s he doing here? He must have gone to Celum with Persua. Hah! I bet she dragged them both here, hoping I failed.\nWell, he’s ignoring me, so I ignore him. I’m already looking for somewhere to turn when I frown and realize I’m hearing pounding shoes on the paving stones to my left. I turn my head, and there’s someone else.\nToriska. She comes out of a side-alley, and I blink. Her pace is slower, but every eight steps she\nblurs\nahead a bit. It’s some kind of Skill that makes up for her shit running form, but she’s here too. She gives me one bored look and then glances away as she heads down the street.\nThe same way as Claudeil. I feel a tingle on my neck and start to slow, but then I see something behind me. More Runners.\nThey appear from behind me and from other streets in a huge crowd. Ten—no,\ntwenty\nStreet Runners appear out of nowhere and surround me. It’s so sudden that I don’t think of running away before they’re all around me. I drift left—and half a dozen Street Runners from the guild I was at plus Claudeil and Toriska are elbow-to-elbow with me.\nWhat the hell is going on? Suddenly, I’m running in a crowd, and they’re jostling and forcing me to run at their speed. I recognize a few of them from the guild, but why are they here? Well, whatever they’re doing, it’s aimed at me. I try to push out of the crowd, but they’re packed too tightly.\n“Get away.”\nI growl, and they ignore me. Well, of course they do. I try to shove my way left, but when I do, they bunch up and ram into me. Hard.\n“You annoying—”\nI throw an elbow, and Claudeil swears as I hit him in the ribs. He’s a big guy, though, and shoves me back. I make a fist.\nOkay, no more nice girl, not that there ever was one to begin with. I stop suddenly and trip up two of the runners behind me. It turns out to be a mistake, because they trip and fall, and their shoes kick into my feet and ankles as they go down.\n“Damn it.”\nGyaaaaaaah!\nThat\nreally\nhurt! But now I’m free. I really want to check my feet and see if their stupid shoes ripped any skin, but something’s up. I turn and run left even as the pack of Street Runners turns to follow me.\n“Don’t let her get away!”\nThat’s\nToriska’s\nvoice. I’ll get her and Claudeil! Although he does have a club and Toriska has a knife. Wait—where’s Persua? But before I can think of that, someone\ncannonballs\ninto me, and I go stumbling left—then a bunch of hands drag me sideways.\nThey shove me left, onto a smaller street. At this point, I’m really starting to get annoyed. And slightly—worried. I could get nastier, but if it comes down to a fight against this many people, they’d kick the crap out of me. No, screw it. I can lose these idiots the instant I get out of the city gates. I’ll go to Remendia, and if more of them show up there, I’ll talk to the City Watch. Or the Runner’s Guild.\nAll I have to do is break free of the group. And that’s easy and hard at the same time. The easy part is grabbing one Runner by the shoulder and shoving her hard so she smacks into a wall. The hard part’s going to be when they start trying to hit me.\nBut they don’t. All at once, the pack of Street Runners in front of me breaks up. I run forwards, towards the mouth of the alleyway before Claudeil and Toriska can catch up. Another three steps and I’ll be in the clear. Why the hell would they—\nI see it too late. A foot’s there to trip me up, and though I try to jump over it, it catches me, and down I go. I stumble forwards and hit the street so hard I think I split my lip.\nOw\n. All the air goes out of me. My teeth explode into pain. I look up—and someone’s staring down at me.\nPersua.\nI don’t have the time to speak before she leaps back. The other runners are already retreating as she backs up.\nI’m going to kill her.\nI push myself up, then blink down.\n“What the—?”\nMy feet are—sticky. There’s something on them. It looks like a spiderweb? Thick and—and then as I’m trying to tug my legs, I realize I hear something. I hear and\nfeel\nsomething.\nRumbling. I feel it in the ground and look up too late. A heavy cart pulled by a large mule thunders at me down the small street.\nOh. Of course.\nI roll and see a familiar sallow face grinning at me as the other Runners disappear into alleys. Get up.\nGet up!\nThe cart barrels down towards me as I scramble to my feet, despite the webs gluing my feet together. I dodge left, but then something\nslams\ninto me. It feels like I just hit a patch of solid air. Magic. Down I go, winded.\nI look up and see the massive wheels crunching down the road towards me. So quick. And I’m lying right in its way.\nOh. Yeah. I’d almost forgotten what I hate about the world. Sometimes I forget, but I’m always reminded in time. What I hate about the world is—\nPeople.\nFor once I’m too slow.\nCrunch.\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "Some days, he, Klbkchhezeim, hated Liscor. Hated Liscor and Izril and every miserable species his people had failed to kill in their first war upon this continent. And he wondered when the third war would begin and thought of killing them all.\nIt was no longer as easy as it would have been. He was old, now. His body wasn’t the one he remembered.\nThe days had long gone when he had another name. Klbkch, they called him now.\nSenior Guardsman Klbkch. And that was just the latest name among nearly a dozen he’d held, many in his people’s tongues that only they knew.\nKlbkchhezeim of the Centenium. No one outside the Antinium now knew what that even truly meant or why it mattered.\nKlbkch the Slayer of the Antinium Wars.\nNow…Senior Guardsman Klbkch, a respected figure of almost a decade in Liscor’s Watch. How things changed.\nHow fast.\nHe still remembered the first time that he had walked through Liscor’s streets, and every child and adult had hid from him. How they feared him until he caught his first criminal, a serial killer.\nEven his partner, Relc—the first time they’d met, the Drake had tried to punch him. He still did, but that was apparently ‘affectionate.’ These days, they were partners. Even if Klbkch had hit Relc for the first time in their entire career as guards.\n“You punched Relc?”\nThe Watch Captain stared at Klbkch as he gave her a formal report at the end of the week. Senior Guards didn’t have to report to a Watch Sergeant or a Senior Guardsman like regular Guards. They were trusted enough to act autonomously, even disappear if need be on an investigation.\nHe was a special case. Both he and the Watch Captain knew it. She was an excellent superior, Watch Captain Zevara. She both respected his role as liaison with the Hive and as a [Guard].\nHe knew she might have to kill him if war broke out again. Or try.\nEven now, it would be easy.\nHis blades were the one thing that hadn’t changed over his life. Two silver shortswords. He could sweep them from his sides and kill her.\nIt was not the first time Klbkch had thought that. But it was a rare thought these days. When he had contemplated his coworkers, and this foreign city, it had been out of self-defense. The Free Hive was meant to be a link between the Antinium and other species. A pact, for both to learn of each other and gain something.\nSo why did he think of killing her?\nWhy Relc? Why everyone he thought to meet?\nWhy today? The answer was simple.\nIt was despair. It was the conversation he’d had with his Queen. They’d agreed to reveal the buried door. It would doubtless begin an event that might benefit them, especially if the ruins were cleared.\nBut that…that was a symbol of weakness. Their Hive should not need to stoop to such measures. They should not be so pathetic.\nNo resources. No aid. Not from the other Hives. Damn them. Not from the Queens. Nor the other Centenium.\nThey were supposed to be Antinium. But it had been ten years.\nTen years of silence. Ten years of being ostracized for thinking differently. Ten years of failure. Almost exactly.\nKlbkch had tried. He’d learned to be a [Guard], sat and eaten with Relc, ignored the tricks and earned the trust of Liscor. If that was all, he could consider his job done.\nBut his Hive had never done what it was meant to do. The Workers and Soldiers toiled, dumbly. They leveled up—a few were over Level 5.\nLevel 5.\nChildren passed Level 5 before they were ten, some of them. Every species levelled, but the only two Antinium in the entire Hive of Liscor above Level 10 were Klbkch and the Queen.\nPerhaps the Grand Queen was right and this was all folly. Perhaps this was a mistake. And he was only waking up to it today. But Klbkch knew they could level. They were just not…\nTrue Antinium.\nNow, he was losing faith. He was tired. He did the same thing day after day as Izril grew stronger. The Hive did not grow, but struggled in the depths. And he was just patrolling, settling petty disputes.\nHe wanted to sit down and have a glass of…blue fruit juice. Spaghetti, perhaps. And why was he thinking that? The inn. Erin Solstice. The silly games of chess.\nHe shouldn’t have indulged her, let alone brought Workers on a trip and wasted money on the inn. But it was almost enjoyable. A kind of bright spot in his days of searching for a spark in his mindless Hive. Wasn’t he entitled to one after ten years?\nIt was a sign, perhaps, that he was growing tired. Losing focus. Perhaps he should ask the Queen, petition the Grand Queen for a Prognugator to replace him.\nHe was just so—empty. And no one knew it.\nThe Watch Captain coughed, and Klbkch realized he hadn’t heard a word she’d said. He jerked, and his blades nearly swept across the desk. But he kept his hands folded behind his back.\n“I’m sorry, Watch Captain. You were saying?”\nShe gave him a surprised look.\n“Are you tired, Klbkch?”\n“I may have received less-than-adequate sleep, Watch Captain. The error is mine. Please feel free to dock my pay.”\nShe almost laughed and raised her brows. The Drake coughed a plume of smoke to one side. He watched her tail, and it was wagging slightly on the ground under the desk. Amusement, then.\n“If I did that to Senior Guardsman\nKlbkch\n, I’d have to censure Jeiss and Beilmark and all the others. Relc would never get paid. And about the punch.”\nHe waited. It was a poor act for a Senior Guard, but Zevara just shuffled the report into her stack of notes.\n“…I’m sure Relc had it coming. You’ve now joined every single Senior Guard and half the regulars who’ve taken some kind of swing at him. I’ll overlook this with a stern warning.”\nShe raised her brows, and Klbkch waited for it. Then he realized she was being either ironic, sardonic, or funny.\nHe had learned to nod along and did so.\n“Then, my punishment, Watch Captain?”\n“Don’t do it again? Relc’s a wild card. If he weren’t a [Spearmaster], I’d have no time for half the trouble he causes. I’m going to consider this as an ‘interdisciplinary act between partners.’ You two are a good team. I won’t keep you. Get some rest. If anything, you made my day when I heard about it.”\nShe chuckled again awkwardly, and Klbkch stood there.\nOther species still confused him. He had broken a rule, attacked his partner, and half the Watch House had come over to shake his hand or laugh about it. Even Relc had said he was ‘right.’\nConfusing.\nThey still confused him even now, after ten years.\nIt would be easy to kill her.\nBut what purpose would that serve? They might be enemies—but he knew her name. Klbkch remembered when Zevara had become Watch Captain, and he had shaken her claw and thought it was good for the city. She smiled at him, and he was lost.\nThe inn. Klbkch saluted and turned to walk down the stairs. To his surprise, the Watch Captain stood with him. She often went to check the Watch House, but she was deliberately not affectionate or close like the previous Watch Captain was. She was good at her job.\n“I’ll walk with you downstairs. Are you heading back to your Hive?”\nShe said it cautiously, for she didn’t know his Hive well. Klbkch nodded and rested one hand on his belt as if he were adjusting it.\nWas this a trap?\nHe doubted it. But he wondered. This was unusual, and she was better with a sword than all but Jeiss.\nAnd she breathed fire. She walked behind him down the narrow staircase, and Klbkch heard the\nscrape\nof something from below. His foot missed a step coming down.\nThere were a lot of people below.\nToo many, unless the Watch was mobilizing for riots or some larger activity. Most should be checking out and patrolling places, but he thought he heard a number of bodies. Breaths intaken quickly and a whisper.\n“…coming. Quiet! Ready—”\nAh.\nKlbkch’s mandibles rose in a smile. So it\nwas\ntoday, then. He lightly let his hands fall and knew the Watch Captain was behind him. He hadn’t suspected it at all. He began to reach out for his Queen. Relc was down there. He could see his partner’s tail swishing behind the front desk as Klbkch descended.\nDozens of [Guards] were loitering around. He might make it out the door or the windows. Then? There would be war. Klbkch slowly reached for the sword on his left with his hand as he saw Relc’s head come up. And he realized—he didn’t really want to kill them.\n“Surprise!\nCongratulations, Senior Guardsman Klbkch!\n”\nThe Antinium’s hand was on the hilt of his sword. He froze as Relc sprang up, and the Watch House erupted into applause. He let go and saw Watch Captain Zevara stop.\nShe, and perhaps only one or two other [Guards], had noticed his hand move. Senior Guardsman Jeiss, the best swordsman in the Watch—blinked—but then he laughed. And he applauded as Klbkch turned, confused.\n“What is going on? Am I being pranked? Again?”\nHe looked at Relc, accusatorially now, angry. It was clear this was not an ambush; no one had bows, and no one was armed. Yet everyone had been waiting for him.\n“Not this time. Senior Guardsman Klbkch, apologies for the surprise.”\nZevara broke in, glancing at him as he straightened. She seemed to realize his mistake and quickly nodded around.\n“Relc, you idiot. Didn’t you drop a hint?”\n“What? I did! Captain Z—”\n“Don’t call me that.”\n“I was talking about the old days all patrol! And how long Klb’s been in the Watch, and that we should end our patrol early—”\nRelc protested as the other [Guards] laughed at him. Klbkch hesitated. He never knew what to say, but he had found honesty worked.\n“I believed you were trying to get me to buy you snacks. Again. And skip work.”\nMore laughter, and now Jeiss and Beilmark, partners, laughed as Relc turned red. Zevara herself issued a rare laugh and shook her head.\n“Well, that’s my fault for trusting Relc. Alright, settle down. We’re going to make it quick. Evening patrol has to go out, but we’re all gathered today, and we had a little whip-round to celebrate you, Klbkch.”\n“Me? What is the occasion, Watch Captain Zevara?”\nShe had produced something from her bag of holding. Klbkch turned to her, and part of him still suspected a trap. But he somehow knew it wasn’t a weapon she brought out of the magical bag. He stared at what she held.\nIt was…a badge. A bright, blue-and-silver badge for Liscor’s Watch. It had the symbol of their city on it, a building over waves. It was a replica of the one on his chest that he would take off when he was off-duty. But his was plain iron, battered and worn.\nThis had silver and bright azure paint. It looked expensive. Zevara offered it to him.\n“Straight from Rafaema’s forges. It’s not much, but we also have a reservation at Wishdrinks with your name on it. We know you’re always busy with your Hive, but you’re booked during your patrol time at the end of the week. We’ll all drop by.”\nA badge? Wishdrinks was an expensive pub fashionable with younger Drakes and Gnolls. Klbkch stared at the badge and looked down at his own.\n“Is my own badge so poorly maintained that it has become an issue for the Watch? You should have alerted me earlier, Relc. Watch Captain, I apologize for—”\nAnd the laughter grew. At his expense, Klbkch was sure, but he held still as even Zevara laughed. Relc took over.\n“Klbkch, you idiot. It’s a\ngift.\nDon’t you know what day it is?”\nSenior Guardsman Klbkch stood there blankly, then he realized.\nThey had remembered it too.\n“Ten years. Well, it’s not\nexactly\nten years, but it’s close enough to the day the Antinium entered Liscor. We thought this was the day to celebrate it.”\n“Plus Beilmark has her birthday next week, so we’re making room for it.”\nJeiss muttered, and his Gnoll partner kicked him in the leg.\n“You idiot.”\nPeople were chuckling, and Jeiss raised his claws in apology, but Klbkch just stood there. Zevara was offering him the badge, and he automatically took it with two of his fours hands. He turned it over and saw how it was expensive. Fresh steel, delicate paint. Someone had even written his name in tiny, gold lettering around the bottom.\nSenior Guardsman Klbkch.\nIt was the first gift he had received in his entire life for doing his job. He had been offered thank-you gifts from a boy he’d saved from being run down by a horse. People he’d saved from being mugged or attacked. Co-workers had offered him trinkets.\nHe used to turn them all down because it was unbecoming of a [Guard] to take them. Then, on advice from Relc, shared them instead if they were edible.\nThis…was a marker.\n“Ten years.”\nZevara looked at him, and he glanced up and saw her light purple eyes watching him. As if, perhaps, she knew what this day meant to him. How could she?\nHow could she know the exhaustion that had been in his soul before his people had even come to Izril?\nThe frustration of a war fought twice to no avail?\nAnd now, ten years of failure. Ten years of looking for a single mind in his mindless Hive? For an Antinium like him? But all Workers and Soldiers did was become Aberration. He patrolled a city that was not his own, and that—\nThat was the only reason he’d stayed sane these ten years. His hand curled around the badge. Gently, Klbkch replaced his old one with the new one and put the old one in his belt pouch.\n“Looking good. We should put you in clothing though, Klb, my man. Especially for Wishdrinks. Imagine if I walked in with only underwear?”\nRelc spoke to laughter, and someone elbowed him.\n“That’s because you’re ugly as shit, Relc. I bet you Senior Guardsman Klbkch’s handsome for an Antinium.”\nThe Drake turned and kicked the [Guard] who’d said that. Zevara shouted before a fight could break out.\n“Alright, that’s enough! Relc, you’re already in trouble. Stop causing trouble or I’ll order Klbkch to punch you again. We’ve taken enough of Klbkch’s time—we’ll see you at Wishdrinks.”\nHer comments were greeted by laughter, and everyone began to get back to work. But they stopped to pat Klbkch on the shoulder or shake his hand. Since he had four, it was quick. And they smiled, and Klbkch was soon walking through the streets of Liscor.\nSenior Guardsman Klbkch. His new badge shone, and of all the Antinium, he was the one whom people greeted. The one they knew. Some still hated him.\n“Guildmistress Tekshia. Good evening.”\nAn older Drake grunted and ignored him. Klbkch walked through the crowd of faces, alone. Unique. Lost.\nHe was never alone. His Queen was always there. He was no longer unique. His body was a Worker’s.\nHe knew his purpose, to restore his people.\nBut his Hive was filled with silent Workers and Soldiers. Not one spoke to him. Only Aberrations spoke, to scream.\nKblkch stood among them as he descended from Liscor’s streets into the subterranean lair. He stood in a passageway where a hundred Workers and Soldiers passed him every second. His hand tightened around his new badge, and he realized he’d forgotten to put it with his gear. He held it and screamed in the darkness of his Hive.\n“Do something. Say something—where are your souls? You mindless, fake Antinium!”\nHis Hive stopped. Every Worker and Soldier stared at him, and he sensed their fear and saw a thousand heads turn and bodies shrink back, limbs draw inwards. A thousand Antinium who lived and died for the Hive, and not a single one worthy of a detail or name.\nKlbkch turned away. He walked to his quarters to rest. To rest and put the badge down and stare at it, the first gift he had ever accepted. He sat there for a long time until the Queen asked why a disturbance had occurred. Then he apologized and got back to work.\nHe wanted to visit the inn. He was tired. He wished he could tell Erin more, but she was a lost girl from another world. She didn’t know who he was, and perhaps if she did, she would fear him rightly.\n“How much longer?”\nHe didn’t know. Klbkch sat there, just for a while longer. Head bowed, no longer hoping for the day he and his Queen had labored so long for. He wondered what kind of party they’d have at Wishdrinks. He held the little badge in his hand, and he was so tired and lost that he could not feel it.\nThe day, at last, that his Hive began to change.\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "They were called Workers.\nIt was more than a name. It was their purpose, their role in life. In the Hive. Worker.\nThat job included many things. They were hammers to build new tunnels and structures for the Drakes and Gnolls in the city. A butcher to separate meat from bone, or a sweeper to remove dust from the street.\nAny task, no matter how menial, was their job. Not for pay or for gratitude from Liscor’s people. For the Hive. For the Queen.\nThat was their purpose. That was…everything. Aside from Aberrations, who were insane, Workers fought monsters if they had to, worked, and died.\nBut when Klbkch brought back the twelve Workers, they were not the same as the ones who had left. They marched into the Hive, and he left them without a word. Klbkch was different.\nYet the Workers who went to sit in the mess hall were changed. The Workers ate in silence—hundreds. But every single one stared at the new Workers, because instead of eating the brown, brackish paste that had little bones in it that crunched—these Workers sat together.\nTogether\n, at the long tables made of dirt. Every Worker sat shoulder-to-shoulder, packed in, their identical shells and bodies—save for where one had scars, a missing arm, a chunk taken out of their carapace—in a row as they ate.\nYet those twelve Workers who had gone above were sitting\ntogether\nsomehow. Leaning over a table, practically ignoring their food. They were…moving something around.\nA possession? Workers\nhad\nno possessions. They had tools they sometimes carried because it was more expedient not to put them down, but they had nothing.\nYet these Workers sat there, and the other Workers, in the dead silence of the barracks filled only with the scraping and\nclacking\nof mandibles as they ate, nevertheless heard something.\nIt was the twelve, pouring over a little piece of paper and pieces of smaller paper. Thinking, perfectly replicating a game they had seen. Playing a game.\nChess.\nThey were thinking so loud that the other Workers could practically hear them. Workers didn’t think. They just—worked. But\nthese\nWorkers were concentrating.\nHow do I move this piece? Rook goes straight. Bishop goes diagonal. Play, fun. Play.\nFun.\nFun? The other Workers who were eating their food had a fifteen minute interval to consume their required nutrition. Then they would go to the barracks and sit in a dirt cubbyhole and sleep. But while the Workers lined up to put the cheap, wooden bowls in a receptacle for them to be filled up again, they slowed.\nA line formed around the table where the twelve Workers, oblivious to all, played. Slowly, taking each step as if weighed down by boulders, Workers coincidentally just\nhappened\nto peek at the board and the concentrating Workers, who had paired off, six by six, to play.\nOnly when one of the Workers looked up and started did they notice nearly a hundred Workers staring at them. All the Workers instantly rushed over to put their bowls away.\nTime to sleep!\nThe twelve Workers got up instantly and hurriedly pushed their food bowls into the receptacle. Most weren’t even touched; they’d eaten food in the inn.\nFlies!\nThe other Workers who marched with them listened to these loud…thoughts. Flies? They imagined the\ncrunch\n, and the twelve Workers had played a game of chess. With an [Innkeeper] who gave them ‘blue fruit juice.’\nWhat did all this mean? The Workers filed into the barracks and began to sit for their nine hours of rest. That was all the rest they got before they spent an entire day working…but the twelve Workers hesitated as they sat together.\nSlowly, one of them shuffled a bit of paper in the dead silence of the other Workers settling into their dirt cubbyholes. They were packed next to each other, thin walls of dirt separating them into alcoves that were barely more than rounded divorts where a Worker could ‘sit’ and sleep. Their rounded back shells prevented them from lying down like other species.\nShuffle, shuffle.\nThe Worker was shuffling the papers around. Then it slowly put the chessboard down and lined up the pieces.\nBlack and white. Erin had colored in the black pieces, and the Worker arranged them neatly. The game had rules. All the other Workers, who were\ndefinitely asleep\nbecause what else would they be doing, didn’t at all listen to the faint sound in the huge barracks.\nOr listen to the rules, which made such sense. Workers liked things like rules, and this was a\ngame\nmade of rules. Each pawn moved forwards but attacked left or right. Or it could take another pawn if it moved diagonally behind them which was called\nen passant.\nThere were many rules like that. You protected the king, and you played like…\nThe Worker pushed a pawn forwards on the white side, then after careful thought, moved another pawn forwards to oppose it. It stared at the board and moved a white pawn forwards in the center four squares, flanking the first.\nNow, at this juncture, the black side could take the white pawn diagonal from it. But what\nif\nyou put another black pawn so that you had four pawns, two black, two white, facing each other?\nWas this good playing? Why didn’t you\ntake the white pawn instead of making an opening?\nNot that the other Workers were paying attention. Or that all of them were united in thought.\nAfter all, if you were really thinking about it, when you moved that pawn up, why didn’t you use the bishop? Could you win a game on pawns alone with their low movement range? Hey, couldn’t you move a knight diagonally outwards and protect your pieces with pawns and never risk your king?\nAha, but then there were ways to checkmate someone\nwithout ever touching the pawns. The [Innkeeper] had shown the twelve Workers all kinds of ways to play, and this game had so many pieces and moves that the combinations of outcomes were virtually endless. Especially with an unpredictable opponent on the other side.\n…Not that this was fascinating. In fact, wasn’t this—\nAberration?\nAll the Workers froze at this. Aberrations were not to be suffered alive. But the twelve Workers weren’t killing them or screaming. The Queen had said nothing—and Klbkch had not killed them. He killed Aberrations.\nSo was this Aberration or not?\nAnd why was that Worker just\nlining up pawn pieces\nin the middle of the board? Move the queen!\nMove the—",

    "text": "It was a long night in which no Worker moved, save for the one who shuffled bits of paper around. The next day, Workers were sluggish owing to something in the food, no doubt.\nBut at breakfast, while the twelve sat and put out the chessboards, something odd happened. A Worker sat across from one of the chess boards being set up and moved a white piece.\nThis was not one of the twelve. All the Workers\nfroze\n—until the one who had been playing last night moved a black pawn up, facing the white pawn.\nA second white pawn joined the first, in the center of the board. Every Worker in the room stared as the second black pawn joined it. The Worker, who had a butcher’s knife because that was his job in the city, stared at the board.\nHe took the first black pawn with his own. And then? The two began to play.\nThere weren’t enough chess boards for the twelve workers; they only had five boards and piece sets from the [Innkeeper]. So sticks and stones were carefully found and placed, and then there were twenty-four Workers. You could, after all, just remember which piece was which.\nTwelve Workers played the twelve who had journeyed to the inn. All twelve newcomers lost the first game completely.\nThey stood up and began to walk off, feeling a vague sense of frustration—but accomplishment. Death might come tomorrow, but they had played a\ngame of chess.\nAnd lost. The Workers were walking to put their dishes away when one of the original twelve Workers beckoned them back. The twelve new Workers saw, to their befuddlement, the original twelve slowly trading seats, rotating one over. Then they sat back down, reset the board, and waited.\nThe new twelve came back to the table, slowly, and sat down. They played again. Lost again. Then the Workers shuffled places and began to play.\nIn silence, the other Workers in the mess hall stared at the games. Twenty-four Workers played together. On the fifth game, the Worker with the butcher’s knife glanced up as one of the watching Antinium carefully moved forwards. He stood up to let the new Worker sit—but the trembling newcomer grabbed his butcher’s knife instead.\nThe trembling Worker stared at the knife as all the other Antinium in the mess hall froze. It raised the knife, stabbed itself in the arm, and green blood ran. Then it opened its mandibles.\n“noOOOooo. NOOOooooooO—”\nIt screamed one word and then began to shriek. The Worker with the butcher’s job backed away.\nThe individual-who-was-no-longer-a-Worker raised the knife and began to stab others. He stabbed and stabbed as Workers fled and the chess boards were abandoned, and then turned. He\nshrieked\n, and the other Workers fled, trying to shield the remaining twenty-three Workers who’d played chess.\nAberration. Aberration!\nThe call went through the Hive, and even the Queen heard it. She called for Klbkch.\nBefore the Prognugator arrived, six more Workers were killed and their parts used to decorate the tables. He walked into the mess hall and a screaming Worker covered in green blood ran at him.\n“wE! WE! a gAMe!”\nIt screamed at him, waving the knife. Lunging at him. Klbkch the Prognugator reached down to the twin swords hanging at his belt. He drew them and swung one blade once. Then he bent, carefully thrust the second blade down, and pulled it sideways.\nHe wiped the silver blades clean and stood. Klbkch stared blankly at the odd, bloody bits of paper on the table and looked around at the Workers huddled at the far end of the room.\n“Clean up the bodies. Get back to work.”\nThen he turned and walked away. The Workers stood there, looking at the dead Aberration. Their fellow Workers, dead.\nAll the same. All the same as it ever was. They picked up the bodies for processing, and a Worker picked up the knife to replace the dead butcher. But as they cleaned up and got back to work, the chess boards stayed. Another Worker joined the twenty-three.\nBy lunch, they had become forty-eight. By dinner? 192.",

    "text": "Erin Solstice had taught the Workers how to play games of speed chess. Lightning rules, she called it, where you had a limited amount of time per move.\nIt was ideal for short moments, like between digging in the tunnels or at a mess hall. Workers picked up stones and sticks and played. Nevermind that you had a ‘board’ of four sticks and a bunch of identical stones.\nAfter all, if you remembered which stones were pawns, rooks, and which were white and black, why did you need a board with shapes? There was nothing else to do. They remembered.\nThat night, the games of chess continued. Not all Workers took part. It was decided that only a quarter should play this new game in case of further Aberrations occurring.\nDecided by who? Not Klbkch. Not the Queen. Neither one had paid attention to the boards. They surely knew because they were the Queen and Klbkch…the Workers just decided it.\nThe Chosen Workers were the original twelve. But now there were 1532—four had died this day due to a monster attack—in the Hive. Not all were in the same mess hall, but they counted.\nCounted who won and lost. Of course, only a few won all the time, and the Chosen Workers were the best players by far. Initially.\nHowever, it seemed clear that the [Innkeeper] had been better than all of them. And this game…this game was fascinating. But perhaps there were strategies, means that the Workers could not fathom?\nThat night, the Workers sitting in the barracks across the Hive played games. They played and played—and one would get up and slowly, carefully, move to another barracks. Then either return or go to a new barracks. The Workers counted and counted and played.\nTherefore, the next day, when the Designated Worker stood, he was tired. He was not one of the Chosen Workers, the twelve, but he was definitively, by numbers, the best for the job.\nHe was afraid when he went to Klbkch’s office. The Prognugator was almost never disturbed; he was getting ready for his work as a Senior Guardsman. Yet the Designated Worker had to go.\nHe was the best player—his win/loss ratio was 54.6%, and thus he had been chosen to make the request. There was simply no other alternative.\nKlbkch was not on duty at this time of day. He had retreated to his personal quarters within the labyrinthine tunnels, a hollowed-out room of stone and dirt near to the surface. He looked up at the knock on his door. When he saw it was a Worker, he immediately drew his sword.\n“State your business immediately or be cut down. Why has the Queen not alerted me?”\nThe Worker froze. One of those two perfect blades was poised to stab, but he bowed his head towards Klbkch.\n“This one would request time off, Prognugator.”\nKlbkch hesitated. He did not lower his sword. That was not the voice of the screaming Aberration of yesterday.\n“…Why?”\nHis arm tensed, but the Worker’s reply stopped Klbkch again.\n“This one wishes to visit the Innkeeper Solstice.”\nNow, Klbkch stood up. Hesitated, then strode towards the Designated Worker and held his blade low, towards the other Antinium’s abdomen. Yet he stopped himself from running the other Worker through. Something was in his voice. A kind of…surprise, wariness beyond belief.\nAnd perhaps something like anticipation. Hope.\n“For what purpose do you wish to visit Erin Solstice?”\n“This one would play a game of chess.”\n“Chess?”\nNeither Antinium blinked. They were incapable of doing so, but Klbkch’s antennae\ntwitched\n.\n“Explain yourself.”\nThe Designated Worker spoke as precisely as it could.\n“This one would learn more of chess for the sake of imparting knowledge onto other Workers. The Workers perceive a limitation in growth after a collective 15,360 games played.”\nKlbkch paused as he digested this information. He looked the Worker up and down, and the blade, slowly, slowly withdrew from the Worker’s abdomen.\n“I see. Your request will be considered. Return to your duties. Now.”\nThe Designated Worker bowed his head and left. Klbkch sheathed his sword, stared at the door, and then banged his head with one of his hands. Then he strode off to make an urgent report to his Queen.\nWithin the hour, he had left the city with the Designated Worker in tow.",

    "text": "After two days of experimentation, Erin had to face the facts.\n“…I still can’t figure out how to make ice cream.”\nAll she could make was weird, sugary butter. She stared down at the pan of churned cream and ice cubes and wondered whether it was still edible.\nShe’d bought the ice and everything from Krshia, and she kept rushing back to her inn in hopes of making it work—but something was wrong, and the resultant mess was nothing like ice cream. Maybe she had missed an ingredient? Her Skill wasn’t telling her what she was doing wrong. Erin stuck a finger in the bowl and tasted it.\n“Hm. Sugary.”\nErin licked her finger and decided it would go well with cereal. If she had any cereal. Well, there was that porridge-stuff, but she didn’t like how much chewing she had to do.\n“Maybe I’ll feed it to Pisces.”\nGlumly, Erin poured her fifth failed experiment into a glass jar. Glass jars were the way to go. Since she didn’t have tupperware and most airtight containers were jars with lids on them, glass jars with corked or glass lids were her best way of keeping things fresh.\n“Too bad I don’t have any preservation runes.”\nErin grumbled to herself as she heaved the jar of milk onto a counter. She’d asked Pisces how much it would cost to get fancy runes done. He’d put the price at anywhere from twenty to sixty gold coins and added that she’d need to replace her cabinets if she wanted to make sure the runes stayed intact.\n“Too rich for my blood. But refrigerators cost a lot too, right? But you only buy one, and that’s that. So I\ncould\nsave up if I ever got any customers. Big crowd one day, radio silence the next. And today as well. That’s life, isn’t it?”\nErin’s head snapped up as she heard the door opening.\n“Speak of the devil.”\nShe raised her voice.\n“Have a seat! I’ll be with you in a moment!”\nErin looked around and cursed. She didn’t have any food ready. It was only lunchtime—she hadn’t expected anyone to actually come by except Pisces, and he could wait forever. But he would have already made a snide remark by now.\nNo helping it. She hurried out of the kitchen and spotted a short creature standing in the inn. It had familiar green skin, pointy ears, and red eyes. Erin started to smile and then stopped.\n“Wait a second. Who the hell are you?”",

One had already entered, and the other Goblins were waiting to enter behind him.\nThe hiding Goblins weren’t waiting to enter. Rather, they were watching with dull dread in their stomachs. They would have liked to do something. Shouted, perhaps. But that wasn’t in their natures, and they were afraid.\nThey had been nine, but now they were four. And they feared making sound and alerting the other Goblins around the inn to their presence. They were forbidden to be here. They had been nine, and now they were four. And they feared becoming zero.\nThe littlest Goblin lay there, barely able to move. The other three were holding her down. They watched helplessly.

    "text": "“Uh, hi there.”\nErin stared at the large Goblin as it glanced around her inn. She was sure she’d never seen this particular Goblin before in her life. He was larger than the rest, taller, brawnier. Not like the big one, but a head taller than any of the other small ones. Some kind of in-between?\nAnd he was carrying a short sword at his waist, not a dagger or a club.\nThe Goblin looked up at Erin. He was still shorter than her by a good head, but he didn’t seem intimidated by her height. On the contrary, he seemed like he wanted to be the one doing the intimidating.\n“Look, can I help you? Do you want food or something?”\nNormally, Erin would have offered him a plate of something at once. But this particular Goblin wasn’t like Rags or her timid friends. There was an aggression about him she recognized. It reminded her of guys from her world. Something about the look, the way he stood there—too tense. Staring at her. It made her back crawl, and she realized her knife was in the kitchen.\nThe Goblin glanced at Erin and said something. He sauntered up to her. She stared down at him.\n“Excuse me? What do you—”\nHe poked her. In the stomach. Actually, it was closer to her pelvis since he was shorter and\nuncomfortably\nclose to another area.\n“Stop that.”\nHe grinned and reached out to poke her again. Erin slapped his hand down.\n“\nStop\nthat. Tell me what you want or get out.”\nThe big Goblin’s eyes narrowed. His hand went to his short sword. Erin made a fist and showed it to him.\n“Try that and I’ll kick your face in. Got it?”\nHe glared up at her. Then, surprisingly, he grinned. He turned his head and called something in that scratchy language over his shoulder.\nErin looked up as the door opened. A Goblin walked into the room, and then another. And then another. And another and another and…\nSuddenly, there were a lot of Goblins in her inn. A\nlot.\nAnd suddenly, purely by coincidence, Erin had just broken out into a cold sweat.\n“Well. You have…friends. Do you all want food?”\nMore Goblins filed into her inn. It was an unending stream of them. They surrounded the bigger Goblin, exactly like a gang of…gangsters. Or, in Erin’s mind, much like a gang of children following the bully.\nErin took one step back as the leader of the Goblin mob grinned at her. He stroked the sword at his waist. Erin thought of the knife in her kitchen but abandoned the idea instantly. Every Goblin in the inn had a weapon, and most were holding them casually in their hands.\nShe had a bad feeling—no, she\nknew\nshe was in trouble.\nThe big Goblin looked around the inn and snorted. Then he spat.\nA glob of greenish spit landed right on one of Erin’s clean tables. Next to a chess board. The Goblin looked at it and then walked over and picked up the pieces.\nShe could run. In fact, Erin was pretty sure she could outrun them. If she got to the door and slammed it shut, then she’d be able to take off. They’d never catch her with their stubby little legs.\nErin slowly edged around a table, as if she were nervous. The Goblin tribe watched her, but they clearly weren’t expecting her to attack. They knew they outnumbered her. She didn’t need to get that close to the door, but if she were just a few feet away, she could—\nTapping\n. Erin looked over and saw the big Goblin leader smacking one of her chess pieces hard against the stone chess board. He grinned: a bully with a new breakable toy that didn’t belong to him.\nSmack, smack\n. He was watching Erin out of the corner of his eye as he bashed a carved figurine of a Drake knight on the board.\nErin saw bits of the fragile chess piece breaking off. Her mouth opened.\n“Oi. Put that down.”\nThe Goblin sneered. It deliberately tossed the knight on the ground. The other Goblins watched as their leader deliberately\nstomped\non the chess piece. It snapped in two.\nErin stared down at the small, stone figurine lying in pieces. She looked up at the grinning Goblin.",

    "text": "The four Goblins heard the faint sound of something\ncracking\nas they waited outside the inn. Then they heard silence.\nThe next thing they saw was the big Goblin\nsmashing\nthrough a window. They ran for cover as Erin strode out the door with a chair in her hands.\nThe big Goblin snarled at Erin and struck at her as she approached. She stepped back and then belted him over the head with the chair. She lost her grip on it, but that didn’t even slow her down. As the Goblin swung at her, she delivered a punch to his face and then jumped back. Erin didn’t know how, but when he tried to rush her, she instinctively stepped sideways and knocked him flat with a kick to his back.\nIt was like magic. Or—a Skill. Bar fighting. That was it. Erin had never really\npunched\nsomeone in her life, but when she made a fist and drove it into the big Goblin’s face, it floored him.\nHe was trying to rip the short sword out of its scabbard. Erin kicked the blade out of his hands as he got it free and then kicked him in the face. As he shouted in pain, she picked up the chair and drove it into his midsection.\n“Not so tough now, are you? Huh?”\nErin raised the chair to hit the Goblin again. She prepared to swing it down—\nAnd something poked her in the side. Erin turned around. She saw a knife sticking out of her skin. It was buried halfway in, and the green clawed hand holding it was shaking.\n“…Ow.”\nA Goblin was behind her. She let go as Erin turned and backed up. Let go—but her crimson eyes were both focused on Erin and very distant. Blood ran down her claw, and Erin felt at the sharp thing in her flesh. She tried to tug at it and felt something moving in her stomach. The female Goblin reached for a second weapon—a rock—and Erin lashed out.\nShe punched the Goblin into the ground, but then another Goblin was next to her.\nStab.\nThis time, the blade was long and thin and went in further, into Erin’s thigh. It was a dull sensation. She\nfelt\nher skin tearing as he raked her side with it. Erin shouted and hit him with her chair hard enough that she felt something in him\nbreak\n. But then another Goblin was next to her. He slashed her in the leg.\nShe didn’t feel it. And that was the scariest thing. As another Goblin stuck a knife in Erin’s back, she felt it go in, but she didn’t\nfeel the pain\n. And the Goblins were suddenly surrounding her. They poured out of the inn as Erin tried to keep them away. And they all had knives.\nStab. Stabstabstabstabstabstabstabstabstabstabstabstabstab—\nErin swung her chair and knocked three Goblins senseless. She kicked out and sent another one flying, then punched one so hard he fell over unconscious. She didn’t know how, but she was suddenly a fighting machine. But the Goblins kept coming, and their knives went in, and she\ndidn’t feel a thing\n.\nTwo more Goblins went down to Erin’s punches before she toppled over. It wasn’t that she’d tripped. She just fell down and saw the blood pooling. Erin wanted to reach out and touch it, but her arms wouldn’t move.\nThe big Goblin was standing over her. When had he gotten to his feet? He had the short sword in his hand, and he was raising it. He snarled around his broken nose. Then his head fell off.\nKlbkch beheaded the large Goblin with one sweep of his swords. He stepped forward to shield Erin as his swords scythed out and cut two more Goblins apart. He addressed the other Antinium by his side, the Worker holding the pieces of paper in his hands. The trembling Worker stared down at Erin as pieces of paper fluttered to the ground.\n“I must save Erin. Cover me.”\nThe Worker nodded and dropped its pieces of paper.\nErin looked up and tried to wave at Klbkch as the ant-man knelt swiftly beside her.\n“Stay awake, Erin. I have a potion. Stay alive for a few seconds longer.”\n“Another p-potion?”\nErin laughed weakly. She wanted to say ‘you shouldn’t have,’ but her mouth stopped working. Klbkch’s hands were a blur as they dove into the pouch at his waist. He uncorked the bottle and splashed half of it over Erin’s legs. The other half he made her drink. He had to hold her mouth open because she couldn’t open it.\nShe felt the noxious liquid go down, and something happened in her body. But Erin wasn’t paying attention. She felt like a spectator, a ghost who wasn’t really attached to the thing Klbkch was cradling in his arms. She saw the Worker fighting as the Goblins recovered from their shock. She saw him dying.\nThe Worker had no weapons. He only had bits of paper. But he charged into the mass of Goblins, striking them with his four hands,\nbiting\n, hitting them. Like how a child fought.\nThe Goblins fell back at first from the ferocity of the assault. But as soon as the Worker found himself in the midst of them, they closed in.\nOne second the Worker was grabbing at Goblin, the next, they covered him. Countless Goblins piled onto the Worker, stabbing, hitting any part of his body they could reach. The Worker fell to the ground, but seized one Goblin by the leg. His mandibles opened, and he\nbit\n.\nThe Goblin\nscreamed\nand stabbed him in the eye. The other Goblins stabbed and clubbed him and then left the broken, crushed shell of the Worker on the ground. They swarmed away from him except for one Goblin, which still screamed in agony as it tugged at its leg. It came away with a sickly\nsnap\nas the leg and flesh ripped from the Worker’s jaws to reveal yellow bone.\nErin blew out a bubble of blood and then coughed. Something warm was flowing up from her cold legs. She could feel them again and—\npain.\nBut she could feel them.\nAs the Goblins spread out around the Human and Antinium, Klbkch stood up from Erin’s side. He drew both swords and daggers and faced the forty-odd Goblins. He looked down at her and then the slot on his belt.\nTwo empty slots for two potions. Klbkch stared around and saw no place to put his back against. He could find a wall—but Erin was lying at his feet. Forty Goblins.\nHe could have run, but the Senior Guardsman didn’t. He looked across from him at the dead Worker. Curled up, staring blankly at the sky.\nA Worker who spoke. A Worker who had desires. A success—\nDead.\nDead. Klbkch felt his mandibles click together. He looked down at Erin. He should have left her. He should have taken the Worker back.\nHe should run or put his back to a wall or—\nthe Antinium lifted the blades and looked around. His voice was a whisper.\n“They call me the Slayer. Come.”\nThe Goblins didn’t wait. They charged, howling with blood and fury. Klbkch waited for them and attacked with all four arms at once. He drew two knives from his waist with his lower hands.\nHis swords cut arcs in the air as they lopped off limbs and heads while his lower arms stabbed out with his knives. The first few Goblins who approached him died before they could take a step.\nBut—so many. Klbkch stepped back as the Goblins kept coming. He spun left and shredded two Goblins with his swords as his lower two arms stabbed a Goblin in the neck with his daggers. One sprinted under his guard and raked his legs with a dagger, but only managed to cut into his exoskeleton. Klbkch beheaded him, but more Goblins jumped on his back. He shook himself like a dog and cut them off of him.\nHe could have moved, but there was something right behind him. His swords slashed out in perfect arcs—until he twisted. Threw himself into a burning vial a Goblin threw. It splashed over him, and his carapace ignited. Not a drop touched the young woman with hazel eyes. The Antinium began burning as the Goblins backed up. One raised a bow—\nThe\ntwang\nand thud were one sound. Klbkch adjusted his leg. He glanced down at the arrow sticking out of it. Erin Solstice’s face stared blankly up at him, as if she were dreaming.\nHis hand flickered. The Goblin holding the bow staggered, and a knife protruded from the Goblin’s chest. She fell, gasping, as Klbkch turned. The Goblins charged him like they had the crab.",

    "text": "Erin watched through lidded eyes. The potion was coursing through her, but the drowsiness was making her sleepy. She couldn’t stay awake. It was like her mind was shutting down every few moments.\nShe kept blinking. Her eyes would close, and then her head would snap back up. Each time she opened her eyes, more Goblins lay in pieces around her. Blood stained the ground and her clothes. And Klbkch. But his blood was green. And there was a lot of it.\nErin opened her eyes and saw Klbkch stagger as a Goblin stabbed him in the back with the short sword. The Antinium turned and beheaded the Goblin, but two more struck him glancing blows from his other side. Even as he turned, more lunged forward. He swept his blades to keep them away, but he couldn’t guard every angle.\nWhy didn’t he run? He was surrounded. If he had his back to the wall, he could fend them off.\nOh. Right. He was defending her. And that meant he couldn’t watch his back.\nErin’s head lowered. The darkness closed in. Then she opened her eyes and saw Klbkch lying on the ground. No—not lying. Fallen. He was on his knees. He still had his blades, but he couldn’t stand up. Green blood dripped from the wounds on his body. So many.\nBut he’d taken vengeance for his injuries. Erin looked around and saw dead bodies everywhere. Pieces of Goblins. Heads. Limbs. Blood coated everything, including her.\nNine Goblins spread out around Klbkch in a wary circle. They didn’t dare approach the Antinium, even on his knees. Erin wondered what they were doing. Oh. They were waiting for him to die.\n“Miss Solstice.”\nIt was a rasping whisper. Erin looked at Klbkch. The Antinium didn’t move, but spoke to the ground as he used one sword to keep himself upright.\n“You must flee. I will buy you a moment.”\nShe stared at him.\n“No.”\n“Can you not move?”\n“I can feel my legs. Sort of.”\n“Then go. Once you are in sight of the city, you will be safe.”\n“No.”\nHe\nclicked\nhis mandibles together.\n“I cannot slay the rest. Nine Goblins are too many—I am a failure. Forty Goblins. Forty\nGoblins—\n”\nHe made a fluttering sound. Erin thought it sounded like an insect’s chirping. She realized it was—laughter. Klbkch whispered.\n“If they could see me. Run.”\n“No.”\nErin said it automatically. Her brain still wasn’t working.\n“No. There aren’t nine. There are thirteen.”\nKlbkch looked up. He saw the four Goblins as they swarmed up the hill from behind the others. The other Goblins hesitated, afraid to turn away from Klbkch, and in that moment, the small band of Goblins struck them from behind.\nThe four Goblins worked together. Two grabbed one Goblin and held him down, and Rags stabbed him in the face while the fourth kept the other eight at bay. He was armed with a large stick and covered his friends from the enemy Goblins. They would have rushed him, but Klbkch was on their other side and shifted whenever they moved.\nRags and the other three Goblins moved from the dead Goblin to flank the other Goblins. They feinted as Klbkch guarded Erin, and the other Goblins turned their attention to them. In an instant, Klbkch threw one of his swords and speared a Goblin through the chest.\nAs the seven remaining enemy Goblins turned their attention to Klbkch, Rags and the three Goblins rushed forwards and repeatedly stabbed another Goblin in the back. They fled backwards even as the other Goblins sliced at them.\nTactics. They fought their kin, and Erin saw the little one, face mashed and bruised, screeching what sounded like orders. Crimson eyes and red blood blurred together.\nWere the Goblins crying? She couldn’t tell. Which ones were weeping? All of them?\nThe seven Goblins backed up. This wasn’t supposed to be happening. They had come to kill a lone Human, however dangerous she might be, not fight deadly insect-monsters and their own kind.\nThey edged away from the wounded Antinium. It was clear that he couldn’t move, and wounded as they were, they still outnumbered Rags and her friends. Rags and her comrades retreated until they had the inn at their backs. But it was still two-to-one.\nThe Goblin that had picked up the short sword pointed at Rags and screeched a command. The seven Goblins turned away. And one of them collapsed with a knife in the back of his head.\nErin blinked down at her hand. She’d picked it up and thrown it without thinking. And it had hit its target. The Goblins turned in shock and looked at Erin.\nShe stood up and\nhit\nthe closest Goblin with an uppercut that snapped his head backwards. Her legs felt like jelly. But they were whole. She\nkicked\n, and another Goblin flew and smashed into a wall.\nTwo more would have rushed her, but this time, Klbkch threw. He missed with his daggers, but his sword hit one of the Goblins vertically and lodged in his head. He fell down, and Erin hit the other Goblin and knocked him down.\nShe turned for the other three, but they were already dead. Two Goblins held the last one down as he\nscreamed\nwhile Rags stabbed him repeatedly in the chest. He convulsed and died.\nErin breathed out shakily. She lowered her fists. She didn’t even notice the two Goblins she’d hit getting to their feet and running. Rags and her Goblins raced after them, screaming their high-pitched war cry.\nSlowly, Erin looked around. The Goblins were dead. Their blood covered everything. Her breathing was ragged; she felt like there wasn’t enough air in the world. The world grew dark, and she staggered. She would have sat down and passed out, but then something moved.\nKlbkch. He collapsed in a pool of green ichor that mixed with the red around him. Suddenly, Erin’s body was full of electricity and panic. She ran over to him. He was trying to get up, but his exoskeleton was full of holes. He was\nleaking.\n“Oh god. Oh god no.”\nKlbkch\nclicked\nat her. He spoke, still in that too-calm tone of his. But his head was jerking, trying to look at her, and it kept falling back. Spasming, as if he were—falling asleep.\n“Erin Solstice. You are safe? Good. My Queen will send—her Soldiers will come. You will be safe.”\nHe tried to reach for her. Erin grabbed his hand and then released it. She helplessly held her hands over the oozing gaps in his body, but his blood ran over her fingers. Klbkch touched at her hair and let his hand fall away.\n“Fascinating. So this—First Queen laugh—in pieces. Today of all days.”\nHis voice was breaking up. Thoughts blending with words. Erin grasped at the green blood oozing from his body.\n“I can’t—how do I stop the bleeding?”\nHe didn’t answer her. Klbkch only sighed. He stared up at the sky. His silver blades lay next to him, coated with blood. His voice faded away. Amused, disappointed in himself, and so bitterly tired. He looked only once at the dead Worker, and then his mandibles twitched.\nHe turned his head north, as if staring a thousand miles at something he had left behind. At last, his voice broke, and he called out as the young woman held his hand. She didn’t know who he was speaking to.\n“I was weary. Forgive me.”\nKlbkch looked as if he wanted to say something else. But then his head lowered. He fell silent and still. Erin couldn’t tell if he was breathing. She put her hand next to his mandibles, but she could feel nothing. No breath of air. Nothing.\nShe stared down at Klbkch. He was bleeding. She had to stop it. She had to heal him. But he’d used her potion.\nShe needed help. She needed Relc or Pisces.\n“Someone!”\nErin looked around and shouted. But there were only the dead Goblins.\n“Help. Help me.”\nErin whispered. She looked at Klbkch. He wasn’t moving. He’d curled up into a ball. He was still bleeding.\nShe had to get help. She had to.\nErin shook. She didn’t know what to do. But she had to—she had to—\nErin slapped herself. She hit herself so hard in the face that the world turned black for a moment. But she’d stopped shaking. She grabbed Klbkch and hauled him up.\nFireman’s carry. She’d learned how to do that in class. It didn’t work the same way with Klbkch because he was bulkier in places. Still, she got him onto her shoulders. He was\nlight\n. Was it the lost blood?\nRun. Erin was already running. She dashed down the hill with Klbkch on her back. Blood ran down her shoulders and soaked her clothing. Blood. She couldn’t feel anything from the burden she carried on her back. No heartbeat, no breathing. Only blood.\nErin ran and ran. Her heart was bursting out of her lungs, and each breath was fire. She felt the muscles tearing in her legs. But she ran on. And she felt the blood as it slowly dripped down her body and onto the grass.",

    "text": "Silence. Erin walked in it. It was the numbing static in her head. It was the sound of tears falling in her heart. It was everything.\nShe walked in the darkness. Short, narrow walls of dirt enclosed her. She followed a massive shape as it led her through the tunnels.\nHer arms were breaking, her lungs screaming as she carried Klbkch, almost falling, towards the gates, and a horn began to blare.\nNoise. Erin still heard it echoing in her memories. They were scattered. She still felt like she was there, blood running sticky down her legs. Not hers. Seeing Liscor’s gates rising as Drakes and Gnolls ran at her, shouting.\n“Klbkch? Summon the Captain! Get a [Healer], now!”\n“—Not breathing. Contact his Hive! Get the Human out of the way!”\n“Klb? Buddy? Speak to me.”\nVoices. Them grabbing her, almost throwing her aside but taking him as carefully as a baby. He was cold. Curled up. His skin—his chitin was cold, and she felt nothing.\n—Bending down, throwing glowing liquid on him. Relc slapping a still face until someone knocked him down. A bright, blue badge covered in green blood.\nRunning feet, a Drake shouting orders until a thousand Antinium, giants, were forcing their way through the crowd. And grabbing Klbkch. And her.\nTaking her down into a place no one could follow. Through walls of dirt and staring faces, each one like Klbkch’s. Workers. And Soldiers. Until she came here.\nTo a chamber where a giant sat.\nMade of the same brown-black chitin as the others but incomparably vast. A feeler, not a hand, shivered in the darkness, and a voice deep, resonant, and female—spoke.\nThen Erin woke from her dream.\n“—Human. What have you done?”\nErin looked up. She was standing in a massive cavernous room. Across from her,\nsomething\nsat in the shadows. The Queen of the Antinium under Liscor.\nThe gargantuan figure moved. Erin couldn’t see. It was so dark. But she caught a glimpse of a massive, bloated body and bulbous backside. The massive Queen of the Antinium was so huge she couldn’t move from her spot.\nThe Queen raised one massive foreleg. She wasn’t like her subjects, who looked vaguely humanoid. The Queen was completely insectile, and her wide, faceted eyes had no pupils nor color to them. They were blank, foreign, unreadable—yet hostile, a dull glow reflecting off the smooth surfaces under the dim light as they focused on the human before her. Erin could not read her face, but she saw the pain and anger. Even in this creature, in her voice.\nShe waited, but Erin said nothing. So the Queen continued.\n“Your name is Erin Solstice. I have summoned you to explain the death of my subject to me. My…Klbkchhezeim.\nMy Prognugator. Klbkch of the Centenium.\nDo you know what you have done?”\nErin looked at the Queen. She didn’t know what to say. Her chest was hurting, but her heart was already broken. They’d taken his body away. She felt like she was still dying. She couldn’t\nfeel\nthe pain, it was so great.\nThe Queen gestured behind Erin. She pointed to the two silent giants flanking the doors.\n“Do not fear my Soldiers. They will cause you no harm if you answer.”\nErin glanced over her shoulder. She’d been grabbed in the midst of the confusion. A group of giant Antinium had swept her out of the guard barracks against her will and the protests of the other guards. Now, they silently watched her.\nThe two guards that stood in the back of the massive chamber were far taller than the Workers. A head higher and thicker and stronger by far. Unlike Klbkch or the Workers, these Antinium were nearly twice their size, with massive forearms and spiked, sharp gauntlets formed of their exoskeleton.\nWhat was strangest and scariest about them was that they held no weapons. Instead, their four arms were bent, and they appeared to be ready at any moment to leap on Erin. Their hands—Erin saw their hands had no real digits, just awkward stumps and tearing barbs. These Antinium were clearly soldiers, built for war.\nThese ones had been made to kill.\n“Erin Solstice. I hold you accountable for the death of Klbkchhezeim.\nSpeak.\n”\nErin looked back at the Queen. She opened her mouth and didn’t know what to say. There was nothing. The silence in her was too large for words.\nBut she had to speak.\n“I’m sorry. I never meant for it to happen.”\nThe Queen loomed above her. Her deep voice deepened further.\n“Is that all you have to say?”\nErin shook her head.\n“I don’t—I can’t say sorry enough. Klbkch—he died protecting me. He was a hero. I’m so sorry.”\nThe Queen silently watched as Erin wiped at her eyes. She raised a single feeler.\n“Human. You misunderstand me. Klbkchhezeim’s death is…is. He is Antinium. Workers and Soldiers die, and if Liscor did not cause this, there is no need for war. But his death was wasted—needless. I am told he perished fighting Goblins. Goblins. Saving you. That is what I find unacceptable.”\n“…What?”\nErin looked up, and the Free Queen stared down at her. Her voice was confused, Erin realized. Confused and angry and hurt.\n“Klbkchhezeim was more than a match for a hundred Goblins. A hundred Hobgoblins could not ambush him.\nHe is Klbkch of the Centenium.\nHe—was—Klbkch the Slayer. The only reason he could have fallen to a mere forty Goblins was because he placed your life above his. And he lost a Worker of—the first Worker in—\n”\nHer voice was rising, her feelers waving. The Queen fell silent. Her trembling voice returned to normal, and she spoke slowly in the darkness.\n“He has paid for his folly. But his foolishness has cost the Antinium living within the city greatly.”\nErin stared at the Queen in shock. In turn, she felt the giant Antinium’s eyes piercing her to the core.\n“I am disappointed, Erin Solstice. I had expected better of my Prognugator’s judgment. He spoke highly of you. Klbkch called you a Human worthy of emulation. But I see nothing to back up his claims. I see no reason why he would have wasted his life saving\nyou.\n”\nWhat? Erin’s head felt fuzzy. What was she saying?\nThe Queen continued. It was hard to discern emotion in her monotone rumble, but there was a definite element of irritation in her voice.\n“My Workers play games in their resting periods. They gain useless levels in classes not needed for their work.\nThree\nhave already become Aberration. This experiment has created naught but waste. My Prognugator’s judgment has been in error.”\nErin struggled for words.\n“He—he was only doing what I asked him to. He was\nhelping.\nHe saved my\nlife.\n”\nShe felt the titanic gaze on her. Erin had to look down. She couldn’t meet the Queen’s eyes.\n“Nevertheless. Klbkch died a failure.”\nErin’s head rose. She stared at the Queen.\n“Take that back.”\nThe Queen’s presence beat down on Erin, but this time, she refused to look away.\n“I will not. My Prognugator’s foolishness has cost Liscor and the Antinium this day. He died a failure.”\n“He was a\nhero!\n”\nErin shouted at the Queen. The guards behind her stirred, but the Queen raised one foreleg.\n“He died worthless, against enemies he should easily have overcome. He died a failure.”\n“No. He was tired. Tired and sorry.”\nErin mumbled the words. The Queen stared down at Erin. Her body had begun rising, and her feelers had risen—like a hammer, over Erin’s head. Now they trembled, in some paroxysm Erin didn’t understand. Her voice shook.\n“Klbkchhezeim said that?”\nErin didn’t know why the Queen froze. She only bowed her head in silence. The Free Queen’s voice was strangled, and her mandibles\nclicked\nuntil she spoke.\n“Then he is a fool as well as failure. We were so close. He had no right to lose hope.”\nErin stared up at the Queen. The massive insect regarded her and then looked away. She flicked one foreleg at her.\n“You do not understand. You, the creatures of the above world, fail to understand all of what is Antinium. Enough. I waste valuable time. You are not worth killing.”\nErin was shaking. The two Antinium Soldiers marched up to her, but she stepped forwards towards the Queen.\n“Why’d you summon me then? To tell me how worthless Klbkch was? He wasn’t. You’re wrong.”\nThe Soldiers seized her roughly. The Queen gestured, and they released her.\n“You are not what we seek. You cannot understand. Klbkch must have been mistaken. I see nothing to admire. Only his failure written large. Begone from this place, Erin Solstice. I have much to do.”\nThe Queen slowly turned away towards the far wall. Erin was dragged out of the cavern by the two Soldiers. She wanted to say something, anything to the Queen of the Antinium. But she could think of nothing.",

She was alone.\nFor a moment. Even as Erin looked around, another Drake walked up to her. He was the yellow gatekeeper Drake.\n“Human. You’re wanted by the Captain. Follow me.”\nErin walked after him without a word of protest. As she walked down the street, she was conscious of people watching her as she passed by. Some murmured and pointed. Others flinched away.\nShe realized she was still covered in blood. Hers, the Goblins’, and Klbkch’s.\nThe yellow Drake stopped when he realized Erin wasn’t following him. He turned and opened his mouth angrily until he saw her throwing up. Silently, he passed her a water bottle and cloth. Erin wiped her face and rinsed her mouth. She walked on.",

    "text": "The guard barracks were full of quiet voices and one loud one. They all fell silent when Erin entered. She looked around and saw a blur pushing his way through the crowd of guardsmen.\nTwo Drakes tried to grab Relc, but he shoved them aside like they were made of paper. More grabbed him as Relc loomed over Erin.\n“\nYou\n.”\nShe looked up at him. Relc snarled at her. His tail was thrashing around, and his fists were clenched at his side.\n“I’m sorry.”\n“Sorry?\nSorry?\nKlbkch died protecting\nyou!\nAll because you didn’t want to kill those damn Goblins!”\n“I know.”\n“This is all your fault.”\n“I know.”\nErin stared at the ground. Relc stepped forward, and the other guardsmen all tensed. But he didn’t attack. Instead, he took a deep breath and spoke with a trembling voice.\n“I had a good partner. He was a silent guy and a real idiot, but he was one of the best guys I knew. And then he died because he went and tried to protect a damn Human. We never even—Wishdrinks.\nIt was just two days ago we gave him a badge!\n”\nShe didn’t know what he meant. Erin squeezed her eyes shut as a bit of spit struck her. She looked up and opened her eyes and saw his sharp teeth opening and closing as he spat at her.\n“I’m sorry.”\nRelc narrowed his eyes as he stared down at Erin. He tensed—and a huge Gnoll and a Drake with a sword grabbed him.\n“Relc—”\nHe tried to shrug them off, but they refused to let go. The Drake was breathing heavily. He raised an arm, and both of the others had it in their grips, but all he did was point a claw at her.\n“I…I don’t want to see you around here again. And if you come running here for help again, I’ll stab you in the gut.\nGot it?\n”\nErin looked up at Relc. His thrashing tail stopped dead as he saw her wipe away the tears in her eyes.\n“Yeah. You do that.”\nShe walked over to a seat and sat down. Tears began flowing from her eyes once more. Relc hesitated. He turned away and kicked a chair. It exploded in a shower of splinters.\nErin barely noticed as the pieces of wood rained down around her. She covered her face with her hands, but the tears leaked through her fingers. She heard a door open and a loud, female voice.\n“You! Human!”\nErin barely moved. The other Guardsmen moved aside as a female Drake advanced. She marched up to Erin. She glared down and snapped.\n“Thanks to you, the only Antinium Guardsman in the city is\ndead\n. The fourth highest-level [Guardsman].\nA Senior Guardsman—\nthe liaison to the Free Hive…”\nShe stopped, looking for words. Her mouth was…smoking. Trails of dark smoke leaked around her lips, and Erin stared at them despite herself. The Watch Captain looked around, and she spoke one word.\n“Klbkch. He’s dead.”\nAll the Watch looked up in silence. The Drake stared blankly around, then looked at Erin.\n“Not only that, he died because he wasted his emergency healing potion on\nyou.\nSaving you from Goblins that should have been wiped out.”\nRelc hammered a fist into a wall and left a dent. Erin didn’t look up, even with the\ncrack\nof wood.\n“Who are you?”\nThe Drake narrowed her eyes.\n“I’m the Captain of the Liscorian Watch. Klbkch was one of my best Senior Guardsmen. Without him, there’s no one to control the Antinium. Without him—if the Queen orders it, Liscor and all of Izril might face another Antinium War.\nOne of their Prognugators is dead.\nWe can only pray they understand it was monsters, not us.”\nA moan ran through the Watch House. Erin didn’t know what to say. She looked up, and her eyes were blurry. She knew it was all bad. It sounded bad. But Klbkch?\nKlbkch was lying there.\nHer tears were only for him. She couldn’t take any of the rest in. Erin gulped for words.\n“Okay. I’m sorry.”\nThe Captain’s tail twitched.\n“Really? Is that all? From what I’m told, Klbkch had to protect you from a mob of Goblins. You’re no citizen. He should have let them eat you.”\n“I guess so.”\nErin didn’t look up. The Captain’s eyes were narrowed in fury, and her tongue flicked out. She\nhissed\n.\n“The Liscorian Watch should never have interfered in the affairs of outsiders. You don’t live in Liscor, and you are not one of our citizens. From here on out, the Watch will cease patrols in your area.”\nThe Captain of the Watch glared at the young woman holding her head in her hands. Erin didn’t look up.\n“Is that understood, Human?”\nNo response. The female Drake’s eyes narrowed dangerously.\n“I said,\nis that understood, Human?\n”\n“You done?”\nErin looked up. Her eyes were red, but she’d stopped crying. She met the Captain’s gaze without flinching.\nThe female Drake stared at her. She had a scar on the left side of her face. Her scales were light blue. Her eyes were yellow and narrowed with rage. She held Erin’s gaze and then turned away in disgust.\n“Get out of my city.”\nThe Captain\nslammed\nthe door shut behind her. In the silence, Erin looked around the room at the other guardsmen.\n“Klbkch died protecting me. He was a hero. He looked out for me when no one else would, and he helped me even though I’m a Human. He was a good person. I’m sorry that he’s dead.”\nShe looked at Relc. He looked away.\nErin wiped at her eyes and then walked out of the room.",

    "text": "Selys found Erin sitting next to Krshia’s stall in the marketplace. The Human had curled up into a ball and was hiding her head in her arms. A Gnoll, Krshia Silverfang, was standing at her stall as if waiting for another customer.\nAt first, it seemed like she was ignoring Erin, but then Selys saw how Krshia was staring. Staring—and not even Lism said a word, nor the hostile Drakes and Gnolls standing at a distance. She let Erin weep as Selys hesitantly approached.\n“Hi? Erin? Are you—are you okay?”\n“Go away.”\nErin didn’t look up. Selys hesitated and then came to stand by the stall.\n“Hi, Krshia. Um, how’re you?”\nThe Gnoll [Shopkeeper] sniffed and nodded without smiling to Selys.\n“Miss Selys. I am well, but Erin is not. She is resting here, away from unkind words. If you have any, you will leave, yes?”\nSelys raised one hand as her tail twitched.\n“No, not me. I just wanted to see how Erin was doing. I, uh, heard what happened.”\n“Everyone in the city has heard.”\nKrshia nodded. She finished arranging a display of onions.\n“It is a dark time. Others mourn, but many are simply upset. The death of Klbkch, it is a bad sign for the city. He was our link to the Antinium. Without him, there will be trouble, perhaps terrible events. But it is wrong to blame it all on a single Human. So think I and other Gnolls.”\n“Really. Really? That’s surprising. I, uh, thought you lot would think differently.”\nKrshia shrugged. She crushed a rotten onion and tossed it in a bin of refuse behind her with more force than necessary.\n“Blood and death. It is not Erin Solstice’s fault where Klbkch chose to fight and die. It is not\nher\nfault the Goblins attacked, yes? We do not blame those who are not guilty.”\n“That’s good.”\nSelys looked at Erin. She wasn’t moving. Tears trickled down her cheeks.\n“Look, Erin, I wanted to talk to you. I know this isn’t a good time, but I don’t think you should go back to your inn. You should stay here, at least for tonight.”\nErin didn’t move. Selys glanced at Krshia. The Gnoll shrugged impassively. Selys tried again.\n“I know you felt safe in the inn, but after this, things will be different. It isn’t just about Goblins. If the Watch doesn’t patrol the plains, more monsters will start appearing. Without protection or high levels, you won’t survive.”\nAgain, no response. But then Erin wiped her eyes on her sleeve before she buried her head back down.\n“Look—I could get you a job in the Adventurer’s Guild as a receptionist. Some of the others might not like it, but you’d be safe there, and you’ll earn enough to eat and live in the city.”\nThis time Erin moved. She shook her head slightly.\n“No.”\nSelys opened her mouth, but Krshia placed a huge furry hand on her shoulder and shook her head. She squatted down next to Erin.\n“Erin. I regret the loss of Klbkch. He was a strange one, one of the Antinium, the Black Tide which came from Rhir, but a good one, yes? Many in the city mourn his death. But he would not want you to die. Without the Watch suppressing the monsters—there will be worse at your door in the wilderness. Even so close to a Drake city. You must know this.”\n“And it’s not like you have to stay here forever. We could look into finding you a place in a Human city if you really didn’t like it. It’s just that it’s a bad time to be here. I know it’s not your fault, but the others—”\n“I’m not going.”\n“Look, Erin, I know how you’re feeling but—”\n“I’m not going.”\nErin stood up. Her eyes were swollen and red with tears. Her nose was dripping, and she wiped her face on her sleeve. She glared at Selys.\n“I’m going back.”\n“\nNot\na good idea. Those Goblins might still be out there.”\n“They’re all dead.”\n“But—there’s monsters. Just stay here. I have an apartment. You can stay the night, okay?”\n“No.”\n“Erin,\nplease.\n”\nSelys wanted to say something more, but she looked over Erin’s shoulder and gasped.\n“Oh my—”\nErin turned. The street had gone deathly quiet. Every shopper and shopkeeper in the marketplace was looking in the same direction. They slowly backed away as a procession of dark insects slowly walked through the market.\nThey weren’t Soldier Antinium. They were just Workers, but there were nearly a hundred of them as they slowly walked towards Erin. The group stopped a few feet from her as Selys stepped behind the counter and Krshia\nsneezed\n.\nErin looked around. Black-bodied Worker Antinium filled the street. They stood in front of her. Suddenly, they all bowed their heads, and the Worker in front spoke.\n“These ones offer condolences to the Innkeeper Solstice.”\nSelys whispered in a panicked voice to Krshia and Erin.\n“What are they doing? They shouldn’t be here! Someone should call the Watch!”\nKrshia nudged Selys hard.\n“Silence. Listen.”\nThe Worker continued.\n“These ones wish for the Innkeeper Solstice to heal from wounds received. These ones express their regret for her suffering.”\nErin stared at him stupidly.\n“Why?”\nThe leading Worker appeared confused.\n“It is part of custom. These ones are taught to express regret/sadness/loss for death in appropriate mourning moments. To cease work during funerals to not disturb Liscor’s citizens.”\nHe said this all so abstractly, as if they were rules he had to obey without knowing why. Erin just stared at him.\n“But I didn’t die. What about Klbkch? What about your—friend? The other Worker? He died protecting me.”\nThe Worker paused and then shook his head.\n“The Prognugator carried out his duties. The Worker died carrying out his duties. No mourning is necessary for broken shells and dead individuals. These ones merely express regret of individual Klbkch’s failure to protect.”\nErin stared at him.\n“So you’re saying you’re sorry I got hurt?”\n“These ones express regret for the failure of the Prognugator to protect the Innkeeper Solstice.”\nThe Worker said it so blankly, almost accusatory, that Erin’s head rose. Her hand tightened on the stall as she pulled herself up.\n“It\nwasn’t\nfailure. Don’t—don’t say that.”\nThe Worker froze—then bowed his head again. All the other Workers did likewise, and its antennae trembled.\n“This one offers apologies for its mistake.”\nShe waited, but that was all. It glanced up at her like a child. It didn’t understand why she was mad, but it was afraid of her.\n“Can’t you feel sorry? For Klbkch? And your friend?”\n“This one apologizes. But this one cannot. These ones offer regret to the Innkeeper Solstice.”\nErin waited. But the Worker just kept its head bowed.\n“Is that it?”\n“Yes. These ones will disperse to assigned duties. Forgive these ones for disturbing the Innkeeper Solstice and others.”\nAs one, the Workers turned. Erin hesitated.\n“Wait.”\nThey stopped and turned back to her. She paused and closed her eyes. Erin took a deep breath and then looked at the Worker.\n“…Come to my inn. I’ll feed you, and you can play chess with me.”\n“What?\nErin!\n”\nSelys grabbed for her, but Erin was moving. She reached out and touched the lead Worker on the shoulder. He went very still.\n“You said you’re sorry? I’m sorry. It was my fault Klbkch and the other Worker died. And that’s a bad thing. Even if you can’t understand it, I want to do something. Let me help you. Somehow.”\nThe Worker hesitated.\n“These ones are not permitted to leave the city or move about without permission.”\n“Why not?”\n“These ones are not suitable for independent action. These ones must not be unaccompanied.”\n“I’ll accompany you. Just—come with me. Please? It doesn’t have to be all of you. What about just you? What’s your name?”\nThe Worker went deathly still. All the Workers did. Erin looked at them curiously. Selys gasped and ran forward.\n“Erin!”\nShe grabbed the Human’s shoulder urgently. Selys whispered loudly in Erin’s ear.\n“You\nnever\nask them what their names are! They don’t have any!”\n“Why not?”\nThe Worker shuddered and looked at Erin. Selys raised one hand as her tail thrashed wildly.\n“They just\ndon’t!\n”\n“This one has no name. This one is not important. This one is not an individual.”\n“You could be.”\n“\nErin!\n”\nThis time, Selys tried to grab Erin and drag her away. Erin fought her hands off.\n“Why? What’s wrong?”\nShe poked the Worker in the chest.\n“You’re an individual. You’re\nyou\n. And the Worker who died? He was someone. Klbkch was\nsomeone\n. You’re all important, and that means when one of you dies, it’s a bad thing.”\nThe Worker shook his head as the other Workers around him backed away. He began trembling and shaking. Erin thought she knew him. Wasn’t he part of the twelve who had come to the inn? Now—his hands shook, all four of them, a tremor as if he were suddenly freezing. It was in his voice too.\n“This one is not an individual. This one cannot be.”\n“You are. Can’t you understand? You’re all special.”\n“Stop saying thAt.”\nThe [Innkeeper] froze. She heard a strange sound in the Worker’s voice. It was trembling, and Selys turned dead white under her scales.\n“\nTribes—\nErin, back away.”\nKrshia reached below the counter of her stall as the people in the street suddenly backed away. The Workers closed around the one who Erin was talking to. He was clutching at his head.\n“stOp talkinG.\nStop\naskING me—”\n“Hey. Hey…don’t be upset. I’m just asking you…are you okay?”\nShe reached out, and he grabbed her arm. So hard her skin bruised. Cold chitin dug into her skin, and Selys made a sound as Krshia slowly pulled something up and pulled a bowstring back. But Erin just stared into the Worker’s gaze.\nShe was crying. Tears ran down her cheeks. They had stopped, and now they returned. The Worker gazed at her.\n“Stop tHaT.\nStop weeping for hiM. Stop aSKING mE—\n”\nHis fingers hurt. But Erin didn’t draw away or move as Krshia hissed at her. She just reached out and gently took hold of one of his arms.\n“I’m sorry. But he was kind to me. Don’t hate him. Don’t say bad things about him. He saved me.”\n“You don’t know what he\nwas.\n”\nThe Worker whispered. He was shaking so badly now that she saw his mandibles opening and closing. Opening and closing, and a razor mouth behind them. His fingers began to dig into her skin.\n“Don’t ask—\nthis one is not Klbkch. Not individual. We are worthless. Just like the one who died there. No names. Not like\nhim.”\nIt was almost pleading with her. Erin looked at the Worker, and she whispered back.\n“You could be. I wish I knew that Worker’s name. I wish I’d known him.\nI wish I could do it all again.\nYou don’t have to have a name. But do you want to?”\nA sound like a keening scream came from the Worker’s mouth. A third hand rose from her arms and grabbed Erin’s throat. It began to\ntighten\n, and Krshia whispered a word as she swung up her bow.\nThen the Worker looked into Erin’s eyes, at the blurred hazel depths filled with tears. It shook and shook until it seemed like it could shake no more and the world was falling to pieces. Its world. It let go of her suddenly and stumbled backwards.\nEight Workers had been dragging it back, but the single Worker had been locked in place so fiercely that their fingers and arms had been cracking its shell without moving the Worker. Now, they tumbled back. An arrow passed straight over the Worker’s head and\nthunked\ninto Lism’s stall. The Drake stared at it. Then—at the Worker.\nHe lay on his shell, staring up at the sky. Erin stared down at him—and appeared in his line of sight. Someone was shouting for the Watch—but the Worker didn’t move. He didn’t scream or shriek. He just lay there.\n“Are you alright?”\nShe stared down at him. Slowly, the Worker got up, and the other Workers pulled Erin back, making a shield between her and—\nThis one. The citizens of Liscor, Krshia—some had drawn blades and others were calling for the Watch, but the Worker did not shout. His trembling had ceased.\nHe felt at his shell and looked around. For a long time, no one said a word. He stared at Erin, and then at last, spoke. Wonderingly, confused.\n“This one—\nI\nunderstand. This one has become I.”\nSelys gasped in horror. The Worker stared down at his hands and then looked up.\n“I understand sorrow. I understand regret for the death of individual Klbkch and Worker. I was wrong. It was a sad thing. For Klbkch. For the Worker. Then death is sad. Then it is all…sad.”\nHe looked around, and the Worker’s antennae waved. His hands shook, but without the wildness of before. He stared around as if a great weight suddenly rested on him. He looked at his kin, and they were frozen. But Erin just nodded.\n“Good.”\nErin didn’t notice the other Workers backing away. The Worker that she’d addressed\nquivered\n. His hands opened and closed restlessly. Selys and the other Drakes instantly backed up. Krshia slowly reached below her counter for another arrow. But the Worker was just prodding at his head, feeling at his body as if it had changed suddenly and he was no longer sure if he had the right one.\n“I. I am. I have become I. I do not understand.”\nHe looked around, up at the sky, at Erin. He shook like a leaf.\n“If this one—is not—how are the many one? An individual cannot exist—the many are—how am I?”\nHe shook. Erin grabbed him.\n“I don’t know. I try not to think about it. Come on. Let’s play a game of chess.”\nHe stared at her. Selys was trembling, and the air in the marketplace was tense. But then the Worker nodded.\nErin turned.\n“I’m going.”\nShe began walking out of the marketplace. The Worker followed her, and the rest of the Antinium followed in a silent, winding procession. Selys stared at Erin’s back, eyes wide. She looked at Krshia.\n“She’s insane. They’re going to kill her.\nIt’s\ngoing to kill her. That was an Aberration—”\nKrshia nodded. Her teeth were bared, and her fur was standing on end, but she had a quiver of arrows now.\n“Yes. It\nwas\nan Aberration but it wasn’t. At least—not yet. Is that how it happens? I do not know. Let us follow quickly, yes? Silverfangs, to me! Get every [Warrior] you can find.”\n“\nWhat?\n”\nSelys yelped, but Krshia was already gone from behind her counter. She barked something at another Gnoll and strode in the direction the Antinium had gone. Selys stared around at the other wide-eyed Drakes and then ran after Krshia.",

    "text": "The Worker walked behind Erin, and his fellows followed the two in a silent mass. She left the city gates behind, ignoring the Drake shouting at her. She walked as fast as she could, trying not to think, to feel.\nBehind her, the Worker shuddered and\ntwitched\nas he walked. Erin ignored that, but she heard him begin to mutter as he walked along.\n“I. I am. But it is wrong. All is wrong. When the many become one, it is Aberration. I am Aberration.”\n“Why? What’s wrong?”\nThe Worker just looked at her blankly, as if trying to explain reality to her.\n“I cannot be individual. I cannot have names. I cannot choose my own actions. It is wrong. I am no longer one of the Workers. I am…me. This is wrong.”\n“Klbkch did it.”\nThe Worker shook his head. He opened and closed his four hands restlessly.\n“He is Prognugator. I am—was Worker. I should not be.”\nErin turned her head.\n“You’re fine. You should be. It’s fine to be a person and not a thing.”\n“I cannot understand. I am Aberration. All is Aberration. This Hive—I cannot accept it. Why am I sad?\nWhy am I sad? What have you done to me?\n”\n“…I’m sorry. But I wanted you to feel something.”\n“I feel. I feel all.”\n“Good.”\nErin kept walking, but the Worker stopped. He started\ntwitching\nagain, and then his gaze snapped to the back of her head. Slowly, the Worker increased his pace until he was right behind Erin. She didn’t notice, lost in her thoughts.\nIn the silence, the Worker reached out for Erin as he walked behind her. The other Workers watched as they followed. They said not a word.\n“I don’t know what it means to be me.”\nErin said it as she walked along. She didn’t know how to explain it to the Worker. She had to say—something. To tell him what it was like.\n“I don’t even know what it means to be Human. All I know is that there’s a big hole in my heart. Because Klbkch and the Worker died. I don’t know who I am or what I’m doing. I’m just—sad.”\nThe Worker paused. His hands hesitated at the back of Erin’s neck.\n“Why?”\nErin smiled. Tears rolled down her cheeks as she walked through the grass.\n“I just am. That’s how it works. You don’t get to choose to be someone. You just are. Even if you’re not special. Even if you don’t want to be. You just are.”\nHe paused. Slowly, the Worker lowered his hands.\n“I do not understand. But—I am. And I too am sad.”\n“Good. That’s—that’s good.”\nErin sniffed and wiped at her eyes and nose. The Worker slowly walked faster until he was next to her.\n“Innkeeper—Erin Solstice. I am sorry for the death of Klbkch and the Worker. I regret their death and your suffering.”\n“Thank you.”\nThey walked on in silence. Eventually, the Worker spoke again.\n“I am no longer a Worker. I am an individual. I would like a name.”\nShe looked at him.\n“I can’t help you. I’m not—I can’t give you one. Couldn’t you ask your Queen?”\nHe shook his head.\n“I—do not wish to. I must have a name. Where may I find one?”\n“I don’t know. Can’t you choose one for yourself?”\nThe Worker paused. He turned his head to Erin and hesitated before nodding.\n“I will do so.”\nShe waited. After a minute of walking, the Worker spoke again.\n“I would like to be known as ‘Pawn.’ It is a fitting name for this individual.”\nErin nodded. She gave him a weak smile.\n“Hi, Pawn.”\n“Hello. Erin Solstice.”\n“…Will your friends be like you?”\nPawn looked over his shoulder. The other Workers looked away. He bowed his head.\n“They are afraid. They will not be like me.”\n“That’s fine.”\n“But I have told them what it means to regret the passing of individuals. They understand.”\n“Really? Good.”\nPawn nodded.\n“They—we. We are all sad.”\n“…I’m glad.”\nThey came to the inn on the hill and the bodies. Erin stared down at the blood and collapsed. She’d forgotten they were still there.\nPawn caught her before she hit the ground. He helped her up, and Erin sat down while the other Workers surrounded the area. They paused as they surveyed the wreckage of the inn and corpses and then seemed to come to a decision. As one, the Workers began hauling the corpses away while others of their number began digging several hundred feet away from the inn. More still entered the inn and began dragging out broken wood.\nErin sat in the grass and looked away. She glanced up as one of the Workers dragged out the body of their comrade. Then she threw up.\nEventually, Erin felt someone tap her on the shoulder. She looked up and saw it was Krshia.\n“Erin Solstice. I was looking for you, yes? The Workers, they have finished their cleaning.”\nShe looked and saw it was true. The area around the inn was clean. Even the grass had been cleaned with water, and the Workers stood silently around the inn. They were all staring at her.\n“Thanks.”\nShe said it to Pawn and then to the other Workers. They nodded as one.\n“We assist to maintain order and preserve peace.”\n“Thank you.”\nKrshia stared at the sign above the Wandering Inn. She looked around and then followed Erin as the Human stepped inside.\n“So, this is your inn, yes? It looks better than I had thought. Worth defending.”\nErin nodded. She looked around the empty room. The Workers had cleaned it almost to perfection. All the broken chairs and tables were gone. But they hadn’t touched one thing.\nA splintered chess piece lay on the floor. Erin slowly walked over to it. It stared up at her, a Drake caught in mid-strike, a spear in his hands.\nShe looked down at the broken knight piece on the floor and picked up the base. Carefully, Erin put it in her pocket and looked around. Silent Workers filled the room. More stared through the windows.\nErin looked around. She saw the chess board and picked it up. It was heavy in her hands. She remembered sitting at a table and staring at a brown ant across the board.\nHer eyes stung, but there weren’t any tears left. Erin brushed at her eyes and then turned with the chess board.\nSlowly, Erin brought the board out and set it down in the grass outside the inn. The Antinium formed a huge circle around her, and Pawn stood in the center next to Erin. She sat down and placed the board in front of her. She gestured, and Pawn hesitated, then sat opposite her.\nErin looked at him. He was a bit shorter than Klbkch, thinner, and his features were somehow less sharp than Kblkch’s had been. He looked nothing like Klbkch at all, in fact. But her heart still hurt to look at him.\nSlowly, Erin put the broken knight on her side of the chess board. Pawn rearranged the pieces on his side. She stared at him. She stared up at the sky. It was too blue, too pristine for a day like this. It wasn’t even night yet.\nThe sky should be raining blood. The world should be filled with darkness, and the earth should have opened up and swallowed her whole. She should have been paralyzed by sadness, but Erin just felt hollow. She understood nothing. It wasn’t fair. It wasn’t right.\nAnd there was nothing she could do about it. So Erin moved a piece on the board. The broken knight moved up to C3. She looked at Pawn. He stared back, and the rest of the Workers stared with him at the Human who wept for Antinium.\nErin bowed her head.\n“Let’s play chess.”\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "Erin sat on a grassy hilltop and played a game of chess. It made life easier. When she was playing, she could forget about life. She could forget about suffering.\nIt didn’t end such things. Chess was an escape. If you were bleeding or crying, it couldn’t help. Playing chess would bring no one back. There was an irony to the game; it was a complex competition still popular hundreds of years after it had been invented.\nA computer would always win. Yet some people, like Erin, had spent great portions of their lives playing this game. In a world of computers and countless other things to devote your time to, Erin had become one of the world’s experts in this game.\nAnd she was an expert. She was no Grandmaster or even an International Master, but she had reached a level beyond most players as a girl. Then the pressure, the game no longer being fun, and the futility of playing this game when real tragedy occurred, when it had no point, came crashing down on her.\nAll that was the same Erin who sat on the grass outside her inn. The fall was changing the colors of this place, and the wind was blowing at the top of the steep hill. If there were only some trees with autumn leaves…this would have been a perfect moment. A hill where she could sit in peace. No monsters. No death.\nKlbkch’s blood and the blood of Goblins still stained the grass elsewhere. Gnolls and Antinium had found some of the bodies that had been left untouched. They were burning them. Erin should have stood and helped, but she was so weary. Her eyes were red from tears and she had no more to give. So she sat and played chess.\nErin moved her pieces on the chess board, pausing, considering, moving, retreating, taking. It was a dance of strategy and perception, and she had learned many of the steps long ago. But chess was always different with every game. That was why she could lose herself in it.\nAnd yet, it wasn’t just calculation that Erin did. A chess player played against an opponent, and unless it was a computer, they read the other player and danced with them. Mind games were part of chess, just like basic strategy and knowing fundamental moves were. But Erin had never played against a mind like the one that sat opposite her.\nShe looked up over her pieces at her opponent, the Worker with a name.\nPawn. He was staring at the board, pondering his next move. His shaking was gone. He no longer spoke in a trembling whisper, and he was—calm. Calm, and as if he were the very grass upon which they sat. Blown away by the wind in this vast sky. Yet he did play, quickly, placing the pieces with the same confidence as Erin did, if not more.\nSomething was wrong with him. It wasn’t just that he had a name. Erin didn’t understand the Antinium, but she understood chess players. Something had seriously gone wrong with him.\nHe was too\ngood\n. Their pieces\nclicked\non the board as Erin Solstice realized she was losing. She had beaten state champions and even played Grandmasters, a rare honor.\nAnd she was losing flawlessly. She could have blamed it on recent events, her lack of sleep, but her mind felt clear, beyond exhaustion and grief. Her focus deepened as she spoke.\n“I still don’t get it. Where do levels come from? Why do people have them? Why do people only level up when they sleep?”\n“I do not know, Erin Solstice. These are mysteries of the world. They are what they are, yes?”\nKrshia shifted in her seat in the grass. She sat with Selys, inside the circle of watching Antinium Workers, but distinctly\napart\nfrom them. She was calm, at least in that she was watching Erin play Pawn, but Selys kept glancing around at the silent Workers nervously.\n“Fine. But if that’s the case, why don’t we get levels for everything? Like…walking. Is there a [Walker] class?”\nKrshia shook her head.\n“Walking is something we do, not something we live for, yes? Only things that we make our goals and dreams form classes. However, there is a [Runner] class.”\nErin glanced up, exasperated.\n“But that makes no sense!”\n“People run for a living, Erin. I’ve never met anyone who walks. That kind of class would be a [Traveller] or a [Journeywoman]. You see? No wait, [Journeywoman] is an apprentice class. See? Now you’re getting\nme\nconfused.”\nSelys sounded exasperated too, but she thought Erin had a point. The [Innkeeper] frowned and waved a pawn in her direction before she put it down.\n“But that\ndoes\nmean you could get a class for eating, right?”\n“You mean a [Gourmet]? I’ve heard some rich merchants and nobility have that class. Lifestyle, Erin. I hear there are some fat slobs who live all their lives just partying and living life up. [Hedonists].”\n“No way. Really? Okay, I think I get it. But people can have multiple classes, right?”\nSelys nodded. She was the bigger expert on classes, apparently. It probably had to do with her being a receptionist. Erin frowned, looked at a knight, and nearly ran right into the trap Pawn had set. How had he become so good?\n“In theory, you could have as many classes as you want. But in practice, even most Adventurers only have three or four classes, tops. It’s because you don’t just get a class even if you qualify for it. It has to become part of your life.”\n“Oh, I get it.”\nSelys paused. Her tail curled up as she sat with her claws folded politely in her lap. Erin had noticed Drakes were expressive with their tails where their faces told nothing. Krshia, on the other hand, had a perfect poker face, and her tail wasn’t nearly long enough to give anything away.\n“Um, did…no one ever tell you this when you were growing up, Erin? I mean,\neveryone\nknows this stuff. It’s basic.”\n“Even the Antinium? Even the Workers?”\nPawn looked up from the board.\n“Yes, Erin Solstice. We are taught such things as we are formed in Birther Sacs. All Workers know of leveling, but we seldom do.”\n“Why? I’ve gained ten…yeah, ten levels this month.”\nKrshia and Selys exchanged a glance. Even the Workers twitched their antennae at each other in their seats.\n“Are you serious?”\nErin looked up and saw Selys gaping at her.\n“What? I’m only Level 10. Isn’t that low?”\n“It is—but—I mean, it\nis,\nbut no one levels up that fast! Erin, normally someone has to apprentice to someone else for\nyears\nbefore they hit Level 10. Most kids—well, most people our age are barely Level 14 in their chosen profession around now. Maybe they have other classes—my friend, Drassi, switches jobs every other week, so she’s barely got levels in anything but [Gossip]. Still! Ten levels in a month?”\n“Really? Only Level 14? That just seems so…low.”\nAgain, Erin had the impression she was the only person in the group that thought that way.\n“Well, Level 100 is the highest, right? Doesn’t that mean most people would get to…I dunno, Level 60 or higher before they die?”\nSelys laughed—more incredulously than politely.\n“You’re joking. Right?”\nErin shrugged. She moved another pawn and took a bishop. Then she realized it was another trap. She was going to lose her other knight.\n“Am I wrong?”\nKrshia nodded.\n“I have known many elderly people. They all have levels in their twenties or sometimes thirties, yes? Few are above Level 40. A great Tribe might have more than one; some tribes have none at all. Few even reach their thirtieth level. If I had to name those above Level 50, there would only be…a dozen in each continent, yes?”\n“So someone over Level 70 for example…?”\nSelys looked at Krshia. The Gnoll shrugged.\n“I don’t think I know of one living, in any class. I’ve heard legends about warriors that reached that level, but those are ancient stories. You know, the kind where a single hero defeats armies by himself or slays Hydras and Krakens single-handedly. People just don’t level that high.”\nErin nodded. She knew they were watching her incredulously, and she knew she was giving away her ignorance. Klbkch had noticed it…\nAnd he was dead. So Erin just went on.\n“Okay. I think I get it. So people level up, but not that high. And you can have more than one class, but you have to level that one up from the start, right?”\nSelys nodded. It was a different nod than Erin’s. Her neck was longer, so it looked more like a long bob than the short motion Erin was used to.\n“Right. If you were a [Spearmaster] like Relc, say, and then you picked up a sword and started using that, you’d probably get the [Warrior] class until you were high enough level and had enough skills for a [Swordslayer] class or a [Duelist] class or something like that.”\n“So classes change names?”\n“Are you\nsure\nno one’s ever talked to you about this?”\n“Klbkch explained some of it to me.”\n“Oh. Um. Oh, I—well, yes, classes change. It’s just usually in name to represent you’re more specialized or—or you’ve hit a higher level. For instance, [Tacticians] usually become [Strategists], but they\ncan\nbecome [Leaders] or [Generals]. It depends on the Skills you have. And what you do with your life.”\n“And…I think I remember this. Skills define classes, right? But doesn’t everyone get the same Skills when they level up?”\n“No. They do not.”\nKrshia stared at Erin. Her eyes narrowed as her brow creased together in a frown. Erin paid no notice. She could see more than people thought when she played chess, and she learned more than she let on. But right now? It didn’t matter.\n“Everyone gets different Skills when they level. Often, they’re the same, but some people get them at different times or get different variations on Skills…it’s about need. Need and want determine what Skills we get.”\n“And what we do, right? That determines our classes, which determines how our level ups affect us and whether or not our classes change.”\nSelys looked relieved Erin was finally getting it.\n“\nExactly.\n”\nErin looked at Pawn. He and all the Workers were staring hard at the board. Erin pushed her king over. She’d lost. They reset the board, and she began again. And once more—he moved so surely she felt like he had been playing longer than she had.\nHow had he done this overnight?\nHe’d been an amateur when she met him in her inn. Now…she glanced up, and all saw his antennae waving slowly in thought. It made her smile.\n“Do the Workers have lots of levels? You guys work all the time, so you’ve got to have lots, right?”\nHe paused, and Erin noticed something odd. All of the Workers were focused on the board. Yet when Pawn moved a piece, suddenly they looked at her or elsewhere. But whenever she moved a piece, they immediately focused on the board again to the exclusion of everything else.\n“We have very few levels, Erin. I myself am a Level 2 [Butcher] and Level 1 [Carpenter].”\n“What? Is it—is it because you’re young or something?”\n“I have lived more than half of the average Worker’s lifespan. The Workers do not level up frequently. Some do not level at all.”\nErin turned in her grassy seat to look at Selys and Krshia. The Drake flicked her tongue out in surprise.\n“I…didn’t know that.”\n“Neither did I. But it is not unexpected, yes? Leveling comes from learning and trials. Without such things there is no experience gained. For one who does the same thing without change, they will not level.”\n“And\nthat’s\nprobably why you’ve leveled so quickly, Erin. Starting an inn by yourself—that’s got to be a lot harder than just working in one or taking over a business.”\n“Oh. Okay.”\nIt had been the hardest thing Erin had ever done in her life. She looked down at her stomach and legs folded pretzel-style beneath her. They should have been full of holes or scarred from countless stab-wounds. Yeah, it was different than just being an innkeeper in a city.\n“So the Antinium don’t level up much? I guess Klbkch was an exception.”\n“A big one. He was the Slayer, a Prognugator—”\nSelys hesitated. She ducked her head.\n“—He was famous among his people, Erin. One of the few Antinium with a name. He—”\nKrshia kicked Selys, and the Drake looked guilty, but Erin just nodded. She took all the feelings and put them into the chess pieces. Just for a while. Then she thought of the Soldiers.\n“But doesn’t that mean they’re weak, then? If most Drakes around my age are Level 10 or higher, why aren’t they way stronger than all the Antinium?”\n“Erin, have you\nseen\nthose giant soldier-types the Antinium keep in their tunnels? I caught a glimpse of one walking through the streets this morning.”\nSelys shuddered. Her tail twitched several times.\n“They don’t\nneed\nlevels, Erin. They’re deadly enough as it is. If you gave them high levels\nand\nchurned them out the way the Antinium can, they’d be an unstoppable army.”\n“Yeah, that’s true. I guess levels can’t replace numbers or muscle, can it?”\n“Well, it\ncan\n, but only if there’s a big difference in levels. Relc, for instance…he’s\nstrong\n. He could probably take on a lot of those soldiers. Not that he would—don’t get me wrong! But he’s Level 32, I think. That’s incredibly different than a Level 13 [Warrior]. Does this all make sense, Erin?”\nErin moved another piece and knew how the game would end.\n“I think I get it. Thanks for explaining.”\n“I just don’t understand why you don’t know all th—”\nSelys was cut off as Krshia elbowed her hard in the side. She\nhissed\nrather than squeaked and sat straight up. Krshia broke into the conversation.\n“It is curious you do not know of levels, but perhaps your people do not level in the same way we do, yes? Rare classes, perhaps? I understand not all classes are earned equally. Especially in places like the Kingdom of Keys. Samal. Peaceful places.”\nSelys frowned at Erin, but the [Innkeeper]’s face was smooth as she moved a piece.\n“Yeah. Something like that. Is leveling a big part of people’s lives here?”\n“Some would call it…belief. Some yes, some think levels rule everything. No one\nw…\nhm, what’s the word?\nWorships?\nThe gods are dead, Erin. They are dead. In some places, leveling is preached and those with the highest level are worshiped. I have heard it said that to each one of us is a maximum level given, and when we reach that level, we have reached the end of our life.”\nSelys rubbed her head as if even talking about this was giving her a headache. Silence fell over the grassy audience. Erin turned in her seat and stared at Krshia.\n“Seriously? Some people believe that?”\nKrshia’s gaze didn’t waver.\n“Yes.”\n“That’s stupid.”\nSelys gasped, but Krshia shrugged.\n“Some believe, Erin. And who is to say what is true?”\n“…I guess.”\nErin turned back to the game and saw Pawn had moved. She tipped over her king.\n“I forfeit again. Good match.”\nPawn bowed from his seat to her. Erin bowed her head back.\n“It was a good game, Erin.”\n“It was a great game!”\nSelys sat up in her seat and stared at the two players.\n“I don’t know much about chess, but I’ve seen Olesm play. You’re way better than he is, Erin. And you…um…Pawn.”\nHe bowed to her, and she flinched.\n“I merely learn from Erin Solstice. She is an expert in this game.”\n“And that’s another thing. How\nare\nyou so good at that, Erin? Olesm says you’re the best player he’s ever seen or heard of. Are you a high-level [Tactician], then?”\n“No.”\nErin was mildly insulted by the suggestion. She helped Pawn reset the board as Selys frowned.\n“What about some other class? Or is it a rare Skill?”\n“No, it’s just\nskill.\nNot the kind you get from leveling up. Just skill in the game. I don’t have any levels besides [Innkeeper].”\n“But then how are you so good?”\nErin took her time before answering. She reset her pieces and switched the board around. Silently, Pawn moved a piece forwards, and she countered. Another game began, but she had the same feeling.\n“I just played since I was a kid, that’s all. Every day. At first it was just a hobby, y’know? Something I saw an adult do, but then I found I liked it. When I won my first tournament, I was over the moon. And after that, I just kept playing.”\nSelys glanced at Krshia.\n“But wasn’t chess invented only a few years ago by the Titan of B—”\nAgain, she received an elbow in the side and glared at Krshia, but then she stared at Erin in sudden interest.",

    "text": "“Well, I guess maybe here it’s new. But chess has been around a lot longer where I come from.”\nErin smiled briefly.\n“A\nlot\nlonger. And lots of people love to play it where I come from. There’s strategy books, lessons online, tutors…I learned it all. Fun fact? I learned how to play chess blindfolded before I learned how to ride a bike.”\nShe moved another piece. After a second of staring, Pawn moved his queen and took it. She frowned and kept playing. Memory was overlapping with reality.\n“I was never the best. But I was good. Really good. For my age? I was incredible. I played in tournaments, I stayed up late playing chess—my parents let me. They knew I had a gift. So I would study chess every moment I had free time, play adults, go to chess clubs and tournaments after school, and I kept winning. But then once you get to a high enough level, you start losing.”\nLike now. Just like now, and then, Erin stared at the board and felt outclassed. She moved a rook and watched it die two moves in the future to protect her queen.\n“It happens. And it’s not surprising. Even a genius kid can’t beat an adult who’s played thousands—tens of thousands more games. But every time I lost, it crushed me. So I quit.”\n“You q—\now!\nStop hitting me!”\nErin smiled, but it was fleeting. Her entire focus was devoted to the game before her and speaking. She had to admit, she’d thought she was too good to beat at one point. As if you could talent past experience.\n…Much like Pawn was doing, actually. Erin glanced up at him. This\nwas\nimpossible for someone to do, play at this level without practice. It was more than intelligence or experience. She knew patterns and strategy. Yet he won. She went on, remembering.\n“Somewhere…sometime I guess I lost interest in playing chess. Or maybe I stopped having fun. I don’t know how to explain it. I was just a kid, but I spent every waking moment playing the stupid game, going to tournaments, studying, winning, losing—I never really\nlived\n. I never played with my friends.”\nShe moved a pawn. The Workers paused, and then Pawn moved a piece.\n“When I realized that, I quit. I just stopped playing, threw away my chess set…I did normal things. It took me years before I even looked at a chess board, and then it was fun to play. But I never wanted to be a Grandmaster again. The pressure, living just for that one game—it’s too much.”\nPawn took her queen, ironically, with a pawn. It couldn’t be avoided, but Erin knew how the game was going to end now.\n“I guess I’m just a normal girl who’s better than 99% of the world at chess. But that last 1%. That’s a heck of a large gap.”\n“If that is the case, Miss Erin, I shudder to imagine what kind of geniuses live in your home nation.”\nAt some point, Olesm had appeared, and Pisces, and even three of the four Goblins. Rags sat in the grass among the Workers, silently watching the game. The Antinium looked at the Goblins and then away, but Selys gripped a dagger at her belt as she glared at the Goblins, and Krshia sneezed. Yet there was peace, however tenuous. Perhaps it had to do with the pile of Goblin corpses buried in the unmarked grave a mile away.\n“I’m sure you don’t think of it this way, but I cannot imagine a player better than you, Erin. I have Skills that allow me to play the game better than most, but I cannot beat you no matter how hard I try.”\nPisces nodded in agreement. Erin grinned mirthlessly. They hadn’t seen how the last few games had been played.\n“Why don’t I level, then? I don’t have any levels in [Tactician], but Pawn tells me the other Workers have leveled up in it. Probably the Goblins as well.”\nErin moved another piece and watched Pawn hesitate. Well, good.\n“We’ve got a ranking system in my world. People who play chess in tournaments get a score, which goes up and down when they win or lose. A Grandmaster’s got about 2600 or more points, and the really amazing chess players all have over 2200 points. If you have that many, you’re pretty much one of the best in the nation.”\nHe decided to lose a knight as opposed to his bishop. Erin frowned. The game was ending. How was he this good? It was impossible. She\nfelt\nlike she was playing…\nA Grandmaster. But it couldn’t be.\n“I got to just over 2000 when I was a kid. That’s insane but—it’s still a huge difference between that and being a Grandmaster. If I kept playing, maybe I’d be around 2400 right now. But either way, I’m one of the best in the place where I lived. In this world—I probably am the best. So why don’t I level?”\nOlesm appeared distressed.\n“…I could not say. It does not make sense.”\n“I can.”\nPisces nodded self-importantly as everyone looked at him. He was still arrogant, but it was muted arrogance, subdued. Erin was grateful for that.\n“Classes are based on what we pursue. Yet—by that same notion, what we consider unimportant or trivial fails to trigger the same classes in other people. It is a known phenomenon I studied during my time in Wistram Academy. I wrote a paper that—well, suffice it to say, if you do not consider chess to be anything other than a game, you would not level.”\nOlesm and Selys looked incredulously at Pisces.\n“A game? But it’s\nobviously\na game.”\n“Allow me to rephrase my statement.”\nPisces looked annoyed as he searched for a better explanation.\n“What I mean to say is that if Mistress Solstice does not consider any of the tactical applications of learning to play chess—how moving pawns is similar to organizing warriors, for instance—she would not level in the [Tactician] class. To begin with, the amount of experience gained from playing chess is far lower than actual work as a strategist, so if she cared not at all about games of war as opposed to games of pieces…”\n“I don’t level. Makes sense.”\nErin tipped over her king and sighed. She’d sped up the rate of her play, but somehow that had only made her game worse, not Pawn’s.\n“I lose. Again.”\nShe sat back in the grass and looked up at the fading sky. Olesm and Pisces stared open-mouthed at Pawn as he carefully set the game back together.\n“How are you doing it? No one gets this good overnight. Not even a genius can play like that on his first go.”\nPawn ducked his head in front of Erin’s stare, cowed.\n“Apologies. But the Innkeeper Solstice makes a mistake. This one—I am sorry. You misunderstand, Erin. At this moment, you are not simply playing me, but all the Antinium gathered here.”\nHe gestured around at the grassy knoll where the countless workers, the two Drakes, two Humans, Goblins, and single Gnoll sat.\n“The hundred play as one mind. We see a hundred moves and play them all in turn. We think together and play as one body.”\nErin stared at him.\n“Hive mind.”\n“Just so. We think as one. That is the nature of the Antinium. Even if—that nature has been compromised by the experiment. Though I am individual, that is still true of me. I do not know why, but I feel…”\nPawn gestured silently around at the other Workers. Something was happening, and not even the other Antinium seemed to understand that. Yet if they did feel each other’s thoughts—Erin looked at him.\n“And Klbkch? And the Worker? Did you feel…?”\nPawn shook his head, slowly.\n“We felt their loss, Erin. But only when we knew it. The Queen remembers. She knows us all. But we—we are Antinium. This is new.”\nHe stared down at his hands as the [Innkeeper] lowered her eyes. Until Pawn spoke.\n“At least, Klbkch will not be gone forever. So long as the Queen lives, she will remember him.”\nErin stopped placing chess pieces back on the board. She stared into Pawn’s fragmented eyes, urgently seeking the truth.\n“But what about the other Worker? What about him?”\nHer reply was a sad look. Pawn’s antennae stopped moving, and he replied quietly.\n“Why would she remember him? He was no Prognugator. He had no name.”\n“But he was brave. He—he died for me. Both of them should be remembered.”\nErin clenched a hand in the grass. Pawn looked at her, and then he bowed his head.\n“He was the designated Worker who won 54.6% of all games he played. He had no name. If you wish it, I will remember him, Miss Solstice.”\nHer head came up. Erin gave Pawn a pained look, but one filled with gratitude.\n“So will I. And you won’t forget?”\nHe shook his head. Pawn peered at Erin’s shimmering eyes and tried to reassure her.\n“Do not be sad, Miss Solstice. We are the Antinium. So long as the Hive exists, all will be well. So long as the Queen lives—nothing else matters.”\nErin paused. She looked down and wiped at her eyes.\n“I wish that were true.”\nThe Antinium moved in shock, but some of them turned from Erin to Pawn and listened. Selys shifted in her seat. She bowed her head. Olesm cleared his throat.\n“As much as it pains me to say it, Erin, I have to disagree with you. Klbkch was truly unique. He was the first—and only—Antinium ever to be accepted as a member of the Watch. Even among the Antinium’s Prognugators, and there are few, he was the only trusted Antinium to ever exist. Ever since the Antinium entered the city ten years ago, he’s been the one who acted as a liaison between their Queen and our city. He is—was the representative of their race. I, um, feel like I should say that about him now. I quite respected him, despite him being an—an Antinium.”\n“I never knew he was so important.”\nKrshia nodded.\n“He was humble. It was why many liked him. And now he is gone.”\n“Not so long as the Queens live. He will be remembered. It is more than any other Antinium has.”\nPawn stared around with something approaching defiance. Erin shook her head.\n“But he can’t speak to us, Pawn. He’s gone for us.”\nHe hesitated.\n“I—see. I feel there is much misunderstood, but I respect your grief.”\nAwkwardly, he placed his king back in position.\n“Will you play another game, Erin?”\n“Would it do any good? I can’t win. You—you’re better than I am.”\nOlesm and Pisces began to protest, but they were quickly drowned out. Every Worker\nclicked\nin denial of Erin’s statement. They made a low\nbuzzing\nsound that was quiet individually, but sounded like an armageddon of bees together. Selys clutched at Krshia’s fur.\n“There is much we learn from each game, Erin Solstice. Please do not stop teaching.”\nErin smiled hollowly.\n“Teaching?”\nIt didn’t feel like that. It felt like running away from everything. But fine. She owed the Workers. She owed the Antinium. So fine.\nSlowly, she drew the board away from Pawn, batting away his hands.\n“Stop that. Let me show you something.”\nShe reversed the board and moved the white pawn forwards.\n“This—is an Immortal Game.”\nInstantly, Pawn stopped protesting. Pisces and Olesm exchanged a glance and moved up. Rags was already sitting next to the board. Erin slowly moved the black pawn up in front of the white one.\n“In the history of chess, there are a lot of famous games that we study because of how brilliant they are. Some people call other games Immortal Games as well. And there are a few famous ones. But this. This is\nthe\nImmortal Game. Some of the moves aren’t considered as good nowadays, but this is still considered one of the pinnacle moments of chess in my world.”\nKrshia breathed\nin\nsharply, but Erin’s words passed over the audience as she moved the chess pieces slowly across the board. Slowly, the two sides played against each other. Erin pointed out each gambit, each strategy and attack and counter as the game played out.\n“King’s Gambit Accepted to open with, and then the Bishop’s Gambit…see here, he tries the Byran-Counter Gambit with the pawn? And then the white side attacks the queen with a knight here…”\nShe played the game out from memory. She’d seen it so many times in her head it was second nature to her. The chess players watched, frowning, trying to keep up with the dizzying display before them. But the Workers stared at the board, and as Erin moved into the last phase of the game and took the white queen, Pawn spoke.\n“We can see the ending.”\nErin looked up. Olesm and Pisces stared at Pawn in disbelief.\n“Show me.”\nPawn hesitated, but then reached out and moved the white pawn up. Erin stared down at the board and played the next move, checking the white side’s king with a queen. Pawn moved the king diagonally, and the game continued.\nA perfect game. He played the game exactly how Erin remembered it. In the silence, she toppled the black king and looked up. Olesm and Pisces were staring at Pawn as if he’d turned into a horrific monster.\n“Good. Now play me. One last time.”\nSilently, Pawn sat opposite Erin and set up the pieces once more. She stared at the board. She was white. Slowly, she moved a pawn forwards.\n“I was always afraid of losing as a kid. Always. I studied so hard so I wouldn’t lose. Maybe that’s why I never improved. I thought losing was a terrible thing.”\nPawn waited and studied the board. He moved a knight forwards in response. Erin whispered.\n“But chess? Chess isn’t scary. Not compared to other things.”\nThat was the last thing Erin said. She wiped at her blurry eyes and set aside her heart for a moment so she could play. It was a relief. It felt so good to lay everything aside and at the same time to let it all out. To let it hurt and play.\nErin’s pulse pounded in the back of her mind. The world around the chess board vanished, and the chess board grew before her eyes. Each piece consumed her vision, and she heard only the\nclick\nof moving pieces. That sound was thunder in her head.\nPawn sat in front of her, but she didn’t focus on him. He couldn’t be read. He couldn’t be outthought. There were a hundred of him thinking over every move. So Erin just played. The chess board was her world, the pieces parts of her soul.\nShe looked at her opponent and saw another Antinium sitting opposite her. Erin dreamt as she played. She was playing in her heart, in the core of her being, in her wishes of what might have been.\nIn this place, there was only the game. And Klbkch.\nErin was crying as she played. Her tears fell on the chess board and into the grass. She played and moved pieces and lost them. But it was all part of a bigger plan, one she couldn’t see, couldn’t understand. She could understand chess. That was easy. But she couldn’t understand anything else.\nShe took the enemy pawns. She took his rook, his knight, his bishop, and his queen. She hounded him, lured him into traps and pushed into his lines and kept her own pieces safe, or gave them away to tear his apart. She pushed and pushed, until he had nothing left.\nIn the silence of her dark world, Erin saw the king topple over. She blinked, and the moment was over.\nPawn bowed his head. Erin heard ringing in her ears and then snuffling. She looked over and saw Olesm was crying. The [Tactician] wiped away tears from his eyes.\n“I will—I will never see—I cannot explain what it is.”\nPisces was covering his eyes, rubbing them with the heel of his hands. Rags was staring at the pieces, her eyes bloodshot as if she hadn’t blinked in an age.\n“It was—that was a display beyond\nanything\nI’ve seen. It was pure! I couldn’t see how it would end! I couldn’t predict the next move! How are you\nnot\na [General] or—or a [Strategist] of the highest level?”\nErin shook her head. She looked at the chess board.\n“It’s just a game. I’m no tactician or even a warrior.”\nShe stared at her hands.\n“I’m just an [Innkeeper]. I don’t want to be anything else. I don’t even want to be that, but I am. That’s all.”\nShe stood up. Pawn stared at her. The Workers stared at her. She met their eyes and bowed her head. She wiped at her eyes and let her tears fall into the grass.\n“I’m sorry.”\nThen she left. Slowly, Erin walked inside her inn and collapsed onto the floor. She slept, mercifully, with the blackness of oblivion and no dreams.\n[Innkeeper Level 11!]\n[Skill – Lesser Strength obtained!]\n[Skill – Immortal Moment learned.]\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

Focus on that instead of anything else.\n‘…The incursion of the Antinium hives into the southern region of the continent led to the bloody year-long war known as the Antinium Wars, or more specifically, the\nFirst\nAntinium War, in which hundreds of thousands of Antinium soldiers established huge colonies across the western coast where it bordered the High Passes, razing cities and forcing Gnoll tribes to retreat into the lower plains regions.\nInitially, the southern Drake cities and allied confederacies were slow to react to the Antinium sweeping through the plateaus and rugged mountainous regions of the continent, underestimating the dangers of an entrenched Antinium hive and the true numbers of the Antinium concealed beneath the earth. It was only after five cities were lost that—’\nGYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! My\nfoot!\nSomeone yanks a\nchair\ninto my foot, notices me, and walks off with a muttered apology. I nearly scream at them.

I stare right back at her, and she turns away. I’m really not in the mood for attention. And thinking about the pain only makes me want to scream out loud. Half from the pain, half from searing rage.

Ah.\n‘The tide of the war only changed after the discovery of the Antinium’s fatal weakness. Using their newfound tactics, the Southern Alliance used long-range mage spells to assault Antinium hives and deter attacking forces.\nOne of the Hives was destroyed entirely before a temporary truce was formed between the Antinium Queens and the leaders of the city states. This peace was tenuous however and lasted for only ten years when the Antinium attacked again, leading to the Second Antinium War…’\nWeakness. They had a weakness? Must have missed that bit.\nLet’s see. Where would that be? And why haven’t I seen these ant-people around? Well, they’re pariahs or outcasts to most societies, so I guess that’s why. But do they have any useful features or are they just bug-people?\nOh, here’s the weakness.\nI pause with my finger on the passage as I hear a cheerful voice calling my name above the hubbub of the inn.

    "text": "Ryoka Griffin was sitting in the middle of an inn. It was not an extraordinary inn—just one of the many inns located in the Human city of Celum.\nShe was reading and scowling. Because she was talented, she could do both at the same time. She was also sitting by herself, occasionally eating from a cold plate left in front of her.\n“Hey there, Ryoka!”\nA cheerful voice drowned out the ambient noise of conversation and drew every gaze. Ryoka looked up from her book and spotted the girl making her way towards her. Her expression didn’t change, but her eye twitched once.\n“Hey, Ryoka, how are you doing?”\n“I’m fine, Garia.”\nGaria Strongheart slid into an empty chair at the table and smiled cheerfully at Ryoka. Her cheerfulness was not reciprocated. Ryoka just glanced up at Garia and went back to reading.\nUndeterred, Garia flagged down a barmaid and requested one of the local drinks, a strong, semi-alcoholic beverage that was cool and flavorful at the same time. In Ryoka’s opinion, it was a shame that the flavor in question was beer.\n“So, how are you doing? Is your leg feeling any better?”\nRyoka glanced up and glared.\n“Guess.”\nGaria’s smile faltered.\n“Did you—did you go to see the [Healer] I told you about? She’s a good one. Works with us Runners all the time.”\n“Couldn’t help. The bone’s too badly broken.”\n“Oh. I’m sorry.”\n“Not\nyour\nfault.”\nRyoka had a talent for shutting down conversations. Garia stared at her and tried to surreptitiously glance at her bandaged leg. She winced and covered her wince by changing the subject.\n“Is that a book?”\nRyoka glanced up from her book. She eyed Garia. Her tone was beyond brusque and was past unfriendly. More into the point where a single word was akin to someone slamming a door into your face.\n“…Yes.”\nYet Garia persisted. She smiled hugely, and Ryoka Griffin didn’t seem to notice how Garia peeked at the red bandages and the…\n…leg…\nUnder the table. Garia’s smile blanched and grew wider. Determinedly. She tried to keep her voice upbeat, but Ryoka was close to snarling.\n“What’s it about?”\n“History.”\n“You mean, world history like you were asking me about the other day? Sorry I didn’t know more.”\nRyoka shook her head. She was sweating and clenching her teeth.\n“The history of the cities.”\n“Oh. Is it, um, interesting?”\n“Not really.”\nIt was\nfascinating\n. Ryoka was no history buff, but it was amazing what being transported to another world did for her interest in mundane things like economics and politics.\n“I’m not a big reader. My dad and mother are, but I can only read when I go home. Books’re too expensive otherwise.”\n“You can read?”\nGaria blushed, but she nodded, a bit proudly.\n“I was taught, and I know more than basic words. Fals can read too, and he owns a few books.”\nRyoka raised her eyebrows.\n“Good for him.”\nAgain, Garia was forced to continue a mostly one-sided conversation.\n“Where’d you get the book?”\n“I bought it in the market. Didn’t cost much.”\n“Really? I thought most books were several gold coins—at least.”\n“Some sell for silver. Either way, it’s fine.”\nRyoka scowled as she chomped on another slice of ham. The lack of any library in this city meant she had to buy any books she wanted to read, and some were annoyingly expensive. But she wasn’t about to get into a discussion of economics with Garia and fuel the conversation.\nThe problem was, Garia was more than capable of finding topics of interest by herself. The other girl stared at the pile of books on the table.\n“Are you going to read all of these, then?”\n“I already read ‘em.”\n“What,\nall\nof them?”\n“Not like I have anything else to do.”\nRyoka deliberately turned a page.",

    "text": "Garia realized Ryoka hadn’t heard her question the third time she repeated it. The other young woman had frozen in place, staring at something over Garia’s shoulder. Garia turned, looked, and knew there was about to be trouble.\n“You.”\nRyoka shoved her chair back and swung up onto her good leg. Good being—operative. Her face blanched, and Garia saw her skin go dead white, but Ryoka pressed past the pain.\nPersua smirked at her. She was, as always, flanked by her friends. Toriska and Claudeil. Claudeil glanced at Ryoka’s legs and then away, but Toriska just glared at Garia. Persua? She laughed at Ryoka in delight and then pretended to be surprised.\n“Oh, Ryoka? I didn’t see you there. Fancy meeting you in this inn. How are you doing?”\nIt was hard getting her other leg out from under the table. But when she did, Ryoka stood up on her good leg and lunged for Persua faster than anyone would have guessed. She never made it, though.\nGaria grabbed Ryoka by the shoulder and gently pulled her back. Despite Ryoka’s attempts to shake her off, she refused to let go and dragged Ryoka back from the smirking Persua and her gaggle of Street Runners. Toriska produced her knife, and Persua danced behind Claudeil.\n“\nAh!\nYou’re rabid, Ryoka! Did you see that? She attacked me for no reason!”\n“Ryoka, stop.”\nGaria was pulling Ryoka back, and she was\nstrong\n, but Ryoka was straining with all her might to get at Persua, fists raised. The other Runners wanted it; Claudeil had his own fists raised, and he was eying Ryoka’s immobilized leg. Persua whispered in his ear, and Garia pulled Ryoka back. The young woman snarled at her.\n“Let\ngo,\nGaria.”\n“No, calm down, Ryoka. If you start a fight,\nyou’ll\nbe the one in trouble.”\nThe expression on Ryoka’s face suggested she was fine with that, but Garia could count. There were at least eight Street Runners behind Persua plus her two friends, and they looked ready to cause trouble. One-handed, she pulled Ryoka back and made her sit back down.\nThat should have been hard to do, even to an injured Ryoka, but Garia was stronger than she looked. And she\nlooked\nlike a farm girl capable of lifting bales of hay with one hand.\nAs she pinned Ryoka to her chair, Garia moved so she was between her friend and Persua. She sat down—and gripped the underside of the table so hard her hands went white.\n“Why don’t we all settle down? Persua, you and your friends can go have a drink somewhere else, okay?”\nIt was a surprise for Garia to say anything to Persua. Toriska’s eyebrows rose.\n“I don’t recall telling you to say anything, Garia. Look at her, Persua.”\nPersua gave Garia a mocking glance. Then she spread her hands innocently and ratcheted up her pitch another octave in innocent protest.\n“I don’t understand what you mean, Garia. I’m just saying hi to Ryoka, who’s had a little accident. Can’t you understand that? Or are things going too fast for you to keep up with?”\nNow it was Garia’s turn to flush, but she didn’t rise to the bait.\n“You’ve had your fun, but I think you should leave, Persua.”\nPersua gave Garia and Ryoka a sickly sweet fake smile.\n“But as a fellow City Runner, I want to let Ryoka know how\nterribly sorry\nI am that she got in the way of that runaway cart. If only she’d listened to her fellow runners. We were all trying to warn her, you know. But that’s Ryoka for you. She just doesn’t listen now, does she?”\nGaria could feel Ryoka’s shoulder trembling under her hand. It was getting harder to hold her down, and that was\nbefore\nPersua ‘accidentally’ mentioned how horrible it had been that no one was able to help Ryoka until she dragged herself to the nearest guardhouse for help. Her other hand gripped the table as the [Innkeeper] glanced up—Claudeil was eying Ryoka’s legs.\nRyoka was staring at a knife on her plate. It was quite sharp—but Toriska was glancing at the other Street Runners sidling around the table, and her foot was dancing. Ready to give a little\nkick—\nShe started forwards, and a sound made her freeze and jump back.\nCrack.\nEveryone looked down. Garia blinked—and a part of the stout wooden table she was holding came away in one hand. Even Ryoka blinked down. The wood was half a foot thick…Claudeil hesitated, and Toriska skipped back a step.\nGaria’s fist was clenched, and she was breathing hard. She was, in fact—angry.\nAs angry as Fals had been.\nBut Fals wasn’t here, and it was just slowpoke Garia, the [Farmer]’s girl. The one who…lifted huge packs of ore and ran for miles.\nThe other Street Runners hesitated, but there were eleven, counting Persua, Toriska, and Claudeil. Ryoka’s leg was broken.\nPersua stared at the table, then her features twisted into a snarl, and she nudged Toriska. The other City Runner skipped forwards as Garia tensed, and Ryoka’s hand closed around the knife—\nBut then the door opened again, and a hush fell over the room. Where the Street Runners had entered into the noise and chaos of the inn, the next group that entered brought silence with them.\nCasual inn-goers of the variety of merchants, farmers, shopkeepers, and so on scrambled out of the way as a huge figure strode into the room. [Tavern Toughs] looked up—and sat back.\nA seven-foot figure loomed over their tables. When he took a step, the liquid in a cheap cup moved. With his horns, he was even taller, and he was already larger than every other man in the room—before his plate armor. And if that was not already enough, the Minotaur had a huge steel battleaxe strapped onto his back.\nHe was followed by seven other figures, each one armed far beyond regular citizens. They carried swords, a longbow, a staff with a glittering crystal top—the only thing that didn’t make the [Innkeeper] scream for the Watch was the fact that they were clearly adventurers. Instead, he brought out a huge keg of ale with a big smile and told the [Cook] to put on a roast.\nAdventurers meant money.\nThe Horns of Hammerad looked around and spotted Ryoka and Garia on the other side of the inn. Their leader immediately made a beeline for the two, walking in an open space of his own. No one wanted to get in the way of the Minotaur’s path.\nHis face was like a bull’s, furred but humanoid enough to show his surprise, gratification—then mounting displeasure. His horns, similarly, rose high above his head and had twin caps of gold, stylized with a hammer and two gates open over waves. If you could see the miniature engravings, they read ‘\nHammerad, Beriad, House of Minos.’\nHe was focused on Ryoka Griffin. Persua was still mocking Ryoka and Garia, oblivious to the newcomers in the inn. The Street Runners behind her were nervously eying the approaching adventurers, but they didn’t move from their spot.\n“Going to take a swing, Ryoka? Go ahead. Toriska—\nToriska.\n”\nPersua hissed at her frozen friend, then she realized she was standing in shadow. She turned—and screamed.\n“\nMonster!\n”\nCalruz stared down at her as Claudeil and Toriska backed away from the giant. Minotaurs were a rare sight, and most of them had never seen one before. Calruz glanced at Persua, then jerked a thumb.\n“You. Runners. Your presence is clearly not wanted or needed. Leave.”\nThe Street Runners exchanged one glance and then shifted out of the way. Calruz snorted in contempt and brushed by them.\nPersua made a disgusted face and pinched at her nose as he passed by. But when one of the female mages glared at her, she shrank back as well. Garia saw a woman with strange, exotic features—\npointed ears\n—and realized she was staring at a half-Elf!\nThere was an unspoken difference in power between the Runners and the Adventurers. The Street Runners stared at Persua, but she took one look at the Horns of Hammerad and backed away.\n“Strange friends you have, Ryoka.”\nShe called out as she backed away. Persua stepped back—and\ntripped\nas the half-Elf accidentally locked feet with hers. Claudeil caught her, and Persua turned white.\n“\nYou—\n”\n“Leave it, Persua. They’re\nSilver-ranks.\nCome on.”\nWithout a word, Persua hurried away. One of the men right behind Calruz, with a mustache, gave the sniggering half-Elf an exasperated glare, but the others looked either approving or didn’t care. And then?\nThey sat down. Suddenly, half a dozen adventurers were at Ryoka’s table, carefully avoiding her feet, gathering around. They were all wearing armor or robes of high-quality cloth. The warriors standing behind Calruz wore shining chainmail, and the mages carried glowing staves and a wand that gave off ethereal fiery sparks.\nThat last bit was especially concerning to the innkeeper, who nervously eyed the wand, but he didn’t make any vocal objections. The tall, mustached Human warrior standing next to Calruz nodded at Ryoka and gave her a friendly smile.\n“Ryoka Griffin? We’re part of the adventuring party the Horns of Hammerad. You bailed us out of a tough situation last week. Do you mind if we sit?”\nRyoka stared up at the adventuring party. She didn’t appear overly impressed. But then, her face was still sweating with pain.\n“Looks like you already are. Glad you made it. What—what do you want? Sit down already; you’re blocking my light.”\nThe vice-captain blinked. He looked uncertain, but the Minotaur laughed.\n“Hah! Spirited! It is good to see that in a Human at last!”\nHe stuck out a massive, gauntleted hand.\n“I am Calruz of the Beriad. We have met before. I lead the Horns of Hammerad, an adventuring party in these parts. I am in your debt, Ryoka Griffin.”\nRyoka blinked in the face of this direct approach. She paused and then reluctantly nodded, shaking Calruz’s hand. She tried to smile—but her leg shifted, and her lips turned into a scowl of pain and suppressed agony.\n“Fine. Go ahead.”\nImmediately, the Horns of Hammerad pulled up chairs and another table to sit next to Ryoka and Garia. Calruz had to sit perched in his chair, which creaked ominously beneath him, but seemed happy enough.\nOnce all the adventurers were seated, a barmaid approached, and they ordered drinks and food. Ryoka wasn’t hungry and she had leftovers of her last meal, and Garia, awestruck by the company, was too shy to eat.\nIn between the barmaids bustling around and delivering drinks and food, the vice-captain leaned forwards and addressed Ryoka.\n“We owe you a debt of gratitude for that delivery you did for us a week ago. Without it, we’d all have been killed by that damned Lich. Thanks to you, though, we managed to kill it and recover a lot of magical artifacts. Ceria’s got a new set of mage robes she owes all to you.”\nOne of the female mages nodded and gestured at her clothing. She was wearing a dark blue set of robes embroidered with glowing golden sigils around the hem and edges of the rich cloth.\n“I bought this with a bunch of the gold we got. The Lich was mostly carrying magical reagents in a bag of holding, by the by. If it was artifacts, we’d have fought over a staff. Unfortunately, it was just rare alchemical ingredients. Some [Alchemist] in Pallass snapped it up, so I got some fancy robes I’d been eying. And they’re pristine,\nso watch the drink, Calruz.\n”\nIt seemed foolish to bring such expensive clothing into an inn, but Ryoka noticed that when Calruz accidentally splattered the dress while reaching for a tankard, the liquid simply ran down the cloth and onto the ground. She was immediately impressed and wondered how much the magical cloth cost.\nGaria looked around the table, wide-eyed.\n“I just heard that Ryoka was doing a delivery to the Ruins. Was it that helpful?”\nOne of the warriors snorted.\n“Delivery? Hah! She charged right past the Lich that had us pinned down and dropped the potions off right in the center of the battlefield! He was casting fireballs and lightning around her, but she even drew his fire as she left—gave us a chance to regroup!”\nRyoka shifted uncomfortably as Garia gaped at her. The problem with being in an inn was that other people were listening. Already, she could tell patrons at the other tables were listening in on their conversation. She shrugged.\n“Just doing my job.”\n“Your job? No other Runner would have pulled off a feat like that. You saved our lives. I thought we were responsible for you getting hurt at first—but it took us a while to track you down.”\nShe was having a hard time meeting the earnest vice-captain’s eyes. Ryoka shrugged and picked at her ham as he continued.\n“Without the potions, the best we could have hoped for would be a retreat where we didn’t lose too many of our party. In the worst-case scenario, we’d have lost over half of our group, and that’s\nif\nthe Lich didn’t follow us.”\nCalruz nodded.\n“Instead, we managed to break that damn skeleton’s head in. The treasure we recovered more than made up for the expedition. And while the rest of our group is still healing from the battle, we’re here to repay the debt we owe.”\nRyoka raised her eyebrows. Minotaurs. Honor? They didn’t seem to go together, but either Calruz was an exception or Minotaurs had quite a strong sense of right and wrong.\nThe vice-captain cleared his throat awkwardly.\n“We expected to meet you again since we heard you were a popular Runner around here. But when we heard about your injury, we decided to drop by.”\nGaria looked surprised. It was a long way from the Ruins of Albez to Celum for someone who wasn’t a Runner.\n“You came all the way here just to do that?”\nCalruz nodded impatiently.\n“Of course. What does distance matter? But let us introduce ourselves properly.\nCeria, introduce yourself.\n”\nHe poked the female mage at his side, and she jumped and glared at the Minotaur. The mage nodded to Ryoka and Garia. She was wearing a hood indoors, which was presumably bad manners, but as she removed it, they realized why and Ryoka got her first clear look at her.\nHer ears were slightly pointed, and although she appeared Human, this mage seemed subtly different from her companions. Ryoka noticed her skin was—rather than being paler, appeared subtly more vibrant. It was as if her body were simply\nrealer\nand more vivid than the rest of the world. It was a slight thing but grew more noticeable the longer Ryoka stared.\nHer eyes tracked down to the young woman’s face. Again, her features were beautiful, but not simply aesthetically. They possessed another dimension she couldn’t explain that added to the exotic nature of the mage’s face. Ryoka saw that her eyes were pale yellow but made no comment.\nThe mage stuck out one hand, and Ryoka took it. She wasn’t an Elf. But she wasn’t Human either.\nHalf-Elf. Her eyes lit up, and she smiled after elbowing Calruz hard.\n“Ceria Springwalker. Village of the Spring, from Terandria. A long way from home, and technically, a student of Wistram. Ice-magic specialist and the only common sense in this crazy group.”\n“…Ryoka Griffin. City Runner, I guess.”\n“I’m Garia Strongheart. From around Celum. Pleased to meet you.”\n“Likewise.”\nThe rest of the company introduced themselves, but Ryoka was still thinking about Ceria. She shook hands mechanically, impassively nodding as the vice-captain expressed his admiration of how she’d saved them. She’d already forgotten his name.\n“Enough of this.”\nCalruz snapped impatiently as soon as the introductions were done. He pointed down towards Ryoka’s leg as it stuck out awkwardly.\n“We didn’t come here to chat. We’re honor-bound to repay our debt, which is why we’re here. And you’re injured. How’d that happen?”\n“Got run over by a cart.”\n“What?”\nThe adventurers looked at Ryoka in frank disbelief.\n“Getting run over by a cart I’d believe of normal people, but a Runner? I thought you lot were fast on your feet.”\nRyoka shrugged unhelpfully and stared at her plate. Uncertainly, Garia cleared her throat.\n“It wasn’t—exactly an accident.”\nShe turned red as the Horns of Hammerad focused their attention on her. Calruz tapped a finger on the table.\n“Explain, please.”\n“Well, I don’t know how to say it, but Ryoka sort of broke an unspoken rule in the Runner’s Guild. She did this delivery and made a lot of folks mad—”\n“—And they decided to run her over with a cart?”",

    "text": "The vice-captain stared incredulously at Garia.\n“Are you serious?”\nShe felt their stares, like she was mad, and Garia desperately took a longer drink of water.\n“It was a wagon, not a cart. Lot heavier. And I didn’t know anything about it! Fals would have stopped it—most of us didn’t know anything until it happened. I found Ryoka at the [Healer]’s…the rest of the Runner’s Guild was horrified. This was the work of Persua’s friends. Not that anyone can prove it. They say it was just an accident and Ryoka tripped.”\nGaria jumped as the mug in Calruz’s hand\ncracked\nand shattered in his grip. He angrily shoved the glass pieces aside and gritted his teeth.\n“What a pathetic, cowardly lot. I’d challenge them all to an honor duel in a moment if I had cause. Didn’t you call for the Watch, at least? That’s how you do it in Izril—what about truth spells?”\nGaria just shook her head.\n“Persua says it was an accident. She says the Guildmaster investigated it and that’s that.”\nThat had been part of why Fals and everyone else weren’t doing anything. Ryoka was white with fury.\n“She lied.”\n“But they were truth spells, Ryoka. We…”\nThe half-Elf, Ceria, interrupted calmly. She leaned forwards and tapped on the table for Garia’s attention.\n“Did you see them administer the truth spells?”\nGaria shook her head.\n“No—could you fake them?”\n“\nI\ncould. With enough help. Sounds like this is politics. Bad politics and a shady Guildmaster.”\n“That’s a scurrilous accusation, Ceria. Don’t go throwing that around.”\nThe vice-captain looked nervous, and Calruz’s face darkened, but Ceria just raised her hands.\n“It’s just a theory. But who’re you going to believe? The City Runner who saved our life with a mysterious broken leg\nor\n…well, don’t pull out your axe, Calruz. We don’t do honor duels here, and that lot would run to First Landing if you looked at them sideways. It sounds like there’s quite a lot of politics in the Runner’s Guild—and dangerous politics at that if this is what happens to people who disobey.”\nThe other adventurers murmured and grunted in disgust.\n“Runners.”\n“Money grubbing backstabbers.”\n“Barely worth the coin we spend to hire them. And for the rates they charge, I could buy a new sword!”\nThe vice-captain just sighed.\n“The Adventurer’s Guild has bad ones too, like former [Bandits]. Hunt, stop spitting on the floor. This Runner’s Guild must be riddled with bad Runners, though. We’ll remember that if we need help.”\nGaria looked like she wanted to object to the insults, but she didn’t dare. Ryoka was interested.\n“You don’t like Runners?”\nOne of the warriors shook his head. That one, Hunt, had a scar on his forehead and pursed his lips to spit again—but Calruz glowered at him, and he swallowed before speaking.\n“You, we like. And your friend here doesn’t seem bad. But the rest of your lot are worthless pieces of waste as far as we’re concerned.”\n“We’re not\nall\nbad.”\nGaria protested weakly. The vice-captain and the mages shook their heads.\n“You don’t understand, uh, Miss Garia was it? I’m sure you City Runners do a good job for civilians. But adventurers? Most Runners don’t do deliveries to battlefields, and some of the ones that do only deliver after the battle ends. We could be in serious trouble, but your people won’t approach until all the monsters are gone. And even then, we have to pay triple—sometimes five times as much just for deliveries to areas we’ve already cleared.”\nAnother woman nodded.\n“Besides, Runners are only concerned about their pay, not anything else. They won’t stop to help even in emergencies unless we pay them. Even adventurers have more integrity than that.”\nThe Horns of Hammerad grumbled, but at least their ire wasn’t directed directly towards Garia and Ryoka. Ceria eyed the dispirited Garia and cleared her throat.\n“That’s not to say all Runners are bad. I know a lot of you deliver goods quickly and for reasonable rates. It’s just that there are quite a few bad Runners in your Guilds, especially the ones that we have to deal with.”\nShe nodded at Ryoka.\n“Case in point, your leg.”\nCalruz snorted angrily as he grabbed another mug from a scared barmaid.\n“This is intolerable. A good Runner shouldn’t be crippled. Ceria, Sostrom. Can’t you do something?”\nCeria eyed Ryoka’s leg as the other [Mage] with a long wisp of black hair he kept brushing out of his hair—it ran down to his chin—shook his head. She rolled her eyes.\n“What are we, Level\n50?\nCalruz, healing magic is the stuff of [Archmages]. No chance a [Mage] can…hm. Well, it’s not anything ice-magic has anything to do with, so I’m useless, and so is Sostrom.”\nThe wispy-haired [Mage] raised a hand and looked embarrassed.\n“If Ceria says so, I agree. I’m self-taught, and she’s\nWistram.\n”\nHe said it like it mattered, and the half-Elf blushed slightly and raised a hand as if to demure. Then she frowned, thinking, but Calruz turned away and grunted at the rest of the table.\n“So? What about a healing potion? How good was that [Healer]? We have [Bone Healers] in the House of Minos well above the grade of local ones. Although even I can set a broken bone.”\nThe vice-captain rolled his eyes.\n“Everything’s better in your home. Go swim to the House of Minos and bring one back, Calruz.”\nNow, Ryoka was regretting not remembering his name, because the Minotaur turned red and glared back at his vice-captain. And the Minotaur, who was the size of the largest Humans to ever exist—got a steady glare in return, which had to take some backbone. Two faintly purple eyes glowered at him before everyone turned back to Ryoka. Garia had a question.\n“\nIs\nit just a broken bone?”\nRyoka shook her head and grimaced.\n“Bone’s shattered. Splinters are in the flesh.”\nAll the people sitting at the table—and in earshot of the conversation—winced. Ceria, however, just nodded to herself and put a finger to her lips.\n“I thought so. If they were trying to hurt you, they had to injure you badly enough that you wouldn’t be able to recover so easily.”\n“Why\ndon’t\nhealing potions work? They fix people with stab wounds up in seconds. Why not bones?”\nCeria shrugged.\n“Healing potions just accelerate the body’s natural healing. But this is far too complicated for a potion to fix. Maybe a high-grade one…worth a few hundred or thousand gold pieces. But that’s out of anyone’s pay unless we were Gold-ranks or Miss Ryoka were a Courier. In situations like this, time or magic is the only solution. Either that or a high-level [Healer], and the cost is hundreds of gold too. Let alone getting to one.”\nDeathly silence fell over the table. Calruz was grimacing darkly, and the vice-captain reluctantly shook his head at him.\n“Too bad.”\nRyoka pushed her chair back and stood up. She paused and winced as her bad foot touched the ground, but then began limping towards the stairwell. Garia, distressed, called out.\n“Where are you going, Ryoka?”\nThe other girl didn’t look around.\n“Sleep. I’m tired.”\nInstantly, the vice-captain stood up.\n“In that case, allow me to help you up the stairs.”\nRyoka eyed the stairwell and looked back at him.\n“I’ve got it.”\n“I insist. Please, let me—”\n“No.”\nThe vice-captain hesitated. He was looking from the steep stairwell to Ryoka’s splinted and bandaged leg. She set her jaw stubbornly.\n“I don’t need help.”\n“But—”\n“Piss. Off.”\nRyoka brushed off his hands and began dragging herself up the stairs. She had a method for it; she walked backwards up the stairs so she didn’t have to move her bad leg more than necessary. It was awkward and cumbersome, but the look in her eyes dared anyone to give her a hand.\nCrestfallen, the vice-captain returned to the table and sat down. The other warrior patted him on the back. Garia awkwardly apologized.\n“Sorry. She’s just—unfriendly.”\n“And in a lot of pain. It’s already forgiven.”\nThe man nodded understandingly, and both he and Garia smiled—until Calruz spoke up.\n“I like her.”\nEveryone looked at Calruz. The Minotaur was watching Ryoka with approval as she swung herself up the stairs.\n“She reminds me of females of my kind. Fiery. The ones who would stab any male that offends. Much better than the simpering Human ones I keep meeting.”\nHe stood up. The vice-captain eyed him worriedly. Ceria leaned forwards and poked Calruz hard in the back.\n“Simpering Human…? You mean our few fans? People who flirt with you? Name me one simpering adventurer. Don’t bother her, Calruz. What are you going to do, seduce her into bed and re-break that leg? She’s not a Minotauress either, and you have all the charm of a rock covered with moss.”\nHe snorted dismissively.\n“Bah. All that’s needed is courage and spirit to win her over.”\nHe knocked his chair back and walked over to the stairwell. The vice-captain looked like he wanted to say something, but lost the initiative. Calruz called over his shoulder.\n“Don’t wait for me. I’ll find you at the Guild later.”\nThe remaining adventurers watched Calruz ascending the stairs and muttered amongst themselves.\n“Should we stop him?”\n“If we do, it’ll be a fight. You know what happens when he loses his temper.”\n“Another destroyed inn? We’ll lose all the money we just earned!”\nThe vice-captain’s eyes narrowed. He drained his mug and stood up.\n“This is unacceptable. I’m going up there.”\nCeria grabbed him by the shoulder.\n“Calm down, Gerial. He’s all about honor. He’ll just annoy her.”\nHe glared at her.\n“You’re letting him go? Are you mad?”\nShe shook her head.\n“Calruz isn’t an idiot. He knows the law. He’ll go if he isn’t wanted, but that’s not what I meant. Ryoka Griffin can take care of herself. Or don’t you remember why we’re here?”\nHe hesitated, but then everyone downstairs heard Calruz’s unmistakable bass rumble. From downstairs, Garia could hear Ryoka’s annoyed voice. She hadn’t known Ryoka long, but Garia knew her well enough to guess what she was saying.\nGaria started biting at her nails as Calruz’s voice rose and he made what sounded like an attempted joke. Ryoka snapped something, but he kept talking.\nUncertainly, Garia stood up. None of the adventurers stopped her as she walked to the stairs and looked up. Both Human and Minotaur were standing outside her room, arguing. Well, Ryoka was arguing while Calruz was…flirting.\nWhich was a mistake, Garia knew. She heard Ryoka’s voice as she snapped at Calruz.\n“Get\nout.\n”\nHe said something in reply, and she pushed at him. Since he was wearing armor and outweighed her by at least two hundred pounds, he didn’t move. Calruz captured Ryoka’s hand in his own. Garia saw Ryoka’s eyes narrow.\nThe patrons of the inn downstairs clearly heard the\ncrack\nand the bellow of pain from Calruz. From her position by the stairs, Garia saw and heard Ryoka\npunch\nthe Minotaur in the face and then saw the Calruz’s form overbalance on the top of the stairs. She watched in slow motion as the massive figure of the Minotaur reeled back from the blow. He grabbed at the wall, but the wood splintered as it broke under his weight.\nIf. If Calruz hadn’t insisted on wearing plate armor. If Ryoka hadn’t hit him quite as hard. If the inn was newer and wasn’t so old. But there were no ifs. Calruz toppled down the stairs in a terrific\ncrash\nof metal on wood, splintering the stairwell and smashing the floorboards on the ground where he landed.\nEveryone stared at the fallen Minotaur as he stared up at the ceiling. Half of the inn’s patrons were already making for the doors, while the other half waited for the ensuing bloodbath.\nAt the top of the stairs, Ryoka raised her middle finger, flipped the prone Minotaur off, and then limped into her room. The door\nslammed\nbehind her.\nCalruz blinked up as the remaining pieces of the stairwell fell down around him and the innkeeper screamed in horror. He stared bemusedly up at Garia and the rest of his adventuring party. Then he grinned.\n“Strong. I like her quite a lot.”\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "As soon as she slammed the door shut, Ryoka collapsed against her bed. Static seemed to crawl over her eyes, and roaring filled her ears.\nPain. It was coming back.\nShe would have lain there forever, but the pain made her move. There was only one relief.\nRyoka staggered over to a chest at the foot of her bed. She fumbled at it and realized it was locked. Key. Where was the damn key?\nThe static was everywhere, and the pain was getting worse. Ryoka had just finished opening the lock when she gagged and nearly threw up. It hurt.\nInside the chest was a roll of odd bandages and several green potions. Ryoka instantly grabbed one and popped the cork.\nSitting with her back against the bed, she stretched out her bad leg as far as she was able. The bandages were red with blood now, and the flesh was beginning to puff up. She’d pushed too far.\nGingerly, blacking out with pain, Ryoka poured the green liquid over her leg and tried not to scream. But the effects were instantaneous.\nThe pain—vanished. For an instant, a wonderful instant, all was well. Ryoka watched in blissful peace as the swelling around her leg faded, and below the bandages, the broken skin and torn flesh closed.\nBut it didn’t last. After only a few seconds, pain started to return to the area. Dreadful, biting agony.\nThe bones. The bits of shattered bones that couldn’t be properly healed. They cut into her flesh and stopped the healing. Her flesh regrew—then grew\ninto\nthe splinters, cut itself open again.\nRyoka stared down at her leg. It hurt, but far less now, as the flesh regrew. At least, for the moment. She had a few hours to half a day, depending on what she did to her leg, before her flesh would\ntear\nand—\nThe bandages were now completely bloody, but Ryoka didn’t dare change them. They were the only things keeping the rest of her leg on her body.\nMagic. She sensed it in the cloth bindings. They’d been what—ten gold coins? More expensive than the healing potions, even. But they had magic in the stitching, or so the [Healer] had claimed. And she felt it. They were the only reason she could move about, let alone keep her leg…intact.\nThe magic in the bandages provided stability, structure, and stasis. She could actually move about on a leg where she couldn’t feel anything below her knee due to the bindings holding her leg in place. And so long as she applied a healing potion every few hours, she could keep the damage from her leg at bay.\nBut eventually, the magic always wore off. And then the swelling would begin, and if it kept on too long, the leg would start to rot.\nMagic bandages and healing potions. Ryoka thumped her head back against the footrest of her bed. They could barely keep her injuries in check, but not heal them. What they were really doing was buying time. Time, until she could find a way to heal herself—\nOr lose the leg.\nShe couldn’t feel it anymore. Rather, it was the broken stump just below her kneecap that screamed agony at her each time she agitated it. But her foot and lower leg?\nNothing.\nThe [Healer] had told her it was still attached, still living flesh so long as she kept healing it with a potion, but it wasn’t about to start healing on its own. It was too badly damaged.\nMaybe if there were a surgeon, one from her world, they could have realigned the bones and connected them with metal rods. If she’d been in a hospital, she would have had a chance. But here?\nRyoka put her face in her hands. Garia kept suggesting better [Healers] or treated her injuries as something that would heal given time. But Ryoka didn’t\nhave\nany time left.\nShe didn’t have any gold left. She had spent it all—ten gold coins for bandages, healing potions—all the money she’d been earning as a Runner?\nNow she wished she’d taken the gold coin from Magnolia.\nBut even if she had—Ryoka Griffin stared blankly at the memory of the encouraging Horns of Hammerad. She felt guiltier now about punching Calruz, but a helpless fury rose in her chest. They didn’t understand. It wasn’t their fault—but she wanted to scream at them. Instead, it came out in a whisper.\n“What do you think splintered bone\nmeans?\n”\nGaria didn’t get it. But then she hadn’t seen Ryoka’s leg in the moments afterwards. She hadn’t seen how it wasn’t\nattached\n, wasn’t\nsolid\nanymore. The adventurers understood.\nCrushed bone. Splintered bone. Not a break or a fracture. It wasn’t like joining two pieces back together. Ryoka’s right leg was a mass of bone splinters without a chance of reattaching on their own.\nMedically, the answer was simple. Until the modern era, there would have been no chance any other way. And even then—her legs wouldn’t have ever been the same. Ryoka knew what had to be done. They’d told her as she sat in shock as the [Healer] poured potions on her leg and tried to save her flesh.\nAmputation. Either that or find a [Healer] hundreds of miles north with the ability to save her leg.\nFor a while, she’d hoped it was just her imagination. She’d bought the bandages from the [Healer], scraped together all the money she’d earned so far to buy enough healing potions to last until now, and prayed that her leg would start to heal. But each day passed with blood and pain and no relief.\nNo one could help her. Ryoka knew that. Garia cared, and even the Horns of Hammerad had stopped by. But what could they do? A hundred—no,\nhundreds\nof gold coins. Why make them worry? Why waste energy reassuring them with useless words?\nSo Ryoka pretended not to worry and did everything herself. Because of pride. Because she didn’t want to appear weak—because that in itself was weakness.\nBecause there was nothing anyone could do to help her.\nRyoka rested her head against her arm. Pain. Cut it away. They said it would be quick. No. But it was the only choice. She had—three healing potions left. Enough for a day or two. And then she’d be out of money and out of time. Unless she could pay. But she had no money.\nWell, she knew someone who had thousands, tens of thousands of gold coins, didn’t she? Of course. And it could be done. There was still a chance.\nBut the cost—\nAh, the cost.\nRyoka closed her eyes. She tried not to let any tears seep out.\nHer legs\n. That was the cost. And she still wasn’t sure if it was worth her leg. She’d thought about it long and hard. And she still wasn’t sure. But she wanted to know the cost. And to do that, she had to bargain.\nSo what Ryoka was really doing, what she was really thinking as she sat in the wet puddle of the healing potion and blood was nothing. Nothing. She could worry or fret, and she was afraid and in pain, but there was nothing she could really do. All she was doing, in truth, behind everything, was waiting.\nWaiting, unable to do more than suffer. Clinging to hope that—what? Someone would produce a magical potion, a real one, and fix everything? Hope that the [Healer] found her and said they had some kind of idea?\nWait until her potions ran out and she had to face a world where she’d never walk again?\nAll because of Persua. All because of a stupid delivery.\nRyoka buried her face in her pillow. It wasn’t fair. It was never fair, she knew, but this?\nWhy me?\nWhy like this?\nIt wasn’t fair.",

    "text": "It was evening by the time Garia managed to excuse herself from the inn and make her way back to the Runner’s Guild. By that point, she’d already imbibed quite a lot of liquid, most of it alcoholic.\nGaria had an extremely high tolerance for alcohol, so she only stumbled every now and then as she jogged towards the Runner’s Guild. She wasn’t intending on making a delivery, of course; that would be dangerous in the fading light even without being drunk, but she wanted to pick up her payment for the week. She was running low on money after insisting she pay for her meal.\nShe’d left the rest of the Horns of Hammerad in the semi-destroyed inn, still drinking and talking about how they could help Ryoka. It was strange. Garia had only heard of the Horns as one of the up-and-coming adventurer teams, but she hadn’t really believed the rumors about them being honor-bound like their leader.\nWell, everyone knew that Minotaurs were supposed to be honorable, but that was hard to believe when you saw one up close. A Minotaur’s word was as good as a [Knight]’s supposedly, but how did you square that with their cow heads and fierce tempers? But Calruz hadn’t been overly violent—he’d even paid for all the damage he’d caused.\nIt was strange. The number of non-Humans Garia had seen, let alone met, she could probably count on both her hands. This far north, you didn’t see any of the other races, not even Drakes or Gnolls. But Calruz had seemed so—so—Human.\nAnd he liked Ryoka. And\nthat\nwas something Garia wasn’t going to think about. Instead, she was going to open the door to the Runner’s Guild without falling on her face and walk inside.\nMost of the Runners glanced up and then away, ignoring Garia as she entered. She wasn’t particularly powerful within the Runner’s Guild, but she was liked well enough that no one bothered her. That was what Garia preferred. Being unnoticed was safest.\nGaria noticed a commotion occurring around the receptionist’s counter, which made her heart sink. The unnoticed part of her reputation also meant she wouldn’t be helped until they sorted out what was going on. Glumly, Garia went to sit down at one of the tables when she heard someone calling her name.\n“Garia! How’s my favorite City Runner?”\nGaria’s heart skipped a beat and then started going into overdrive as she recognized the voice. Fals. She turned around and gave him what she hoped was an annoyed look.\n“I bet you say that to every Runner, Fals.”\n“Only the ones I like.”\nFals walked over and smiled at Garia. He was handsome and tall, and Garia could see several female Runners glaring at her as he approached. She tried not to smile back too quickly.\n“Are you finished with your deliveries for the day?”\n“Yup. Nothing too special; I did a few trips to Lindol and back, but that’s it. How about you? Taking a late-night request?”\nGaria shook her head.\n“I’m just collecting payment. What’s with all the panic, though?”\nShe pointed to the group of Runners and staff of the Runner’s Guild who were standing around in a cluster at the counter, arguing and looking panicked. Fals made a face.\n“You won’t believe this, but for the last few days, Lady Magnolia’s been asking for a delivery. Trouble is, she only wants one Runner to do it. Guess who?”\nGaria didn’t even need to think.\n“Ryoka. Oh. And what did the Guild tell her?”\n“Oh, I don’t know the details…”\nFals waved a hand self-deprecatingly, but that was just an act. Garia had no doubt he knew exactly what had been said and probably had a part in shaping the message.\nHe\nwas one of the most influential Runners in the entire region around Celum, and the local Guildmasters listened to him.\nThat might not mean much further north with big cities like Invrisil, but it mattered here. She just wished—he could help Ryoka, but no one could, no [Healer] in any of the cities she’d visited.\n“The Guild told her Ryoka was indisposed. We kept offering replacement Runners, but Magnolia kept insisting that she only wanted Ryoka. And now…well, it sounds like she came in person and demanded some answers just a few minutes ago. I was going to see what happened myself. Want to listen?”\nGaria hesitated. It probably wasn’t wise to put herself in the spotlight—but then again, Fals was the one in charge. So she nodded and followed him across the room.\nFals whistled as he passed the board full of delivery requests. He stopped and pointed to one unmarked request Garia recognized.\n“Wow. Look at that unmarked request. Whoever’s posted it is offering twenty gold coins for a delivery. No, wait, twenty gold to\ntake\nthe delivery. ‘More upon negotiation’? Sounds like a trap. Or a scam, but who’d fall for that?”\nGaria peered at it.\n“It’s the same one I saw a week ago. I told Ryoka only a Courier would take that. Was I wrong? I thought\nmaybe\nyou might…”\nFals shook his head instantly.\n“Are you kidding? I still want to live. Didn’t you see the location? The High Passes. That’s a death trap for anyone. I might have some levels on you, but you’re right—it’s Couriers or a stupid City Runner.”\n“It’s not possible at all? Even for you?”\nHer admiring look was returned by Fals’ mock-glare.\n“Even for me. For any Runner who takes it. I hope no one’s stupid enough to head out there, but with that reward—I think we might lose a few. I’ve been telling all the hotheads not to try it, and they seem to be listening for now.”\n“Think a Courier will come by?”\nThat made him pause. The request really was an odd mix of appealing to low-level Runners and…\n“Dunno. Maybe a Courier will do it if the reward keeps rising. But it’s sort of…cheap for them to risk getting hurt. It’s more likely the one who posted it will give up after a month or two.”\nHe shrugged.\n“But frankly, even if they doubled the reward, no sane Runner would risk a delivery like that. Profit’s important, but our lives are worth way more.”\nGaria remembered something one of the adventurers had said. She frowned.\n“Fals? I know you’re one of our best Runners, but why aren’t there any older Runners than you? You’re only twenty-two—”\n“Twenty-\nthree\n. I’m getting old, Garia. Please don’t rub it in.”\nShe blushed and tried not to stammer.\n“—Twenty-three, then. But why aren’t there any other Runners? I know a lot of us die or get hurt, but surely there should be some more, right?”\nFals considered her question. He sighed and raked his hand through his blonde locks.\n“We don’t have many experienced Runners because no one who does this job lives very long. We’re the only people crazy enough to deliver. Most folks change classes after they earn enough.”\n“I heard people say Runners only care about money.”\nFals eyed her sternly.\n“What kind of people have you been talking to, Garia?”\nHe didn’t wait for her response.\n“Never mind. Okay, sure, a lot of Runners are interested in the bottom line. But isn’t that normal? Adventurers, shopkeepers, merchants…even nobles care about money. Why shouldn’t we charge what we do and prioritize the best deliveries? We work a tough job! And we risk our lives every day, running from monsters, dealing with bad weather, natural disasters…it’s enough to make most folk quit within their first week.”\nHe thumped at his chest.\n“But we—we’re Runners. We don’t quit! Everyone who makes it past a year is a real Runner, Garia. We’re the people who keep the cities—no, the entire world connected. Without us, nothing would get done on time. So if people call us money-grubbers, well, let them. We’ve got our own honor, and we deserve every coin we get, am I right?”\nHis words lit a spark in Garia’s heart and within the other Runners in earshot. She nodded enthusiastically as other Runners called out to Fals.\n“That’s our lead Runner!”\n“No wonder you’re the best in the region!”\nPersua appeared out of nowhere and purred at Fals. Garia jumped as the skinny girl smiled and fussed over him with her gaggle of Street Runners, edging Garia away. Someone elbowed her—hard. Toriska, paying Garia back for speaking up earlier. The [Farmer]’s daughter retreated as Fals was surrounded. He never noticed the jab as he smiled with a bit of reserve.\n“No wonder they call you Fleetfoot Fals!”\nHe grinned and shook his head.\n“That’s an old nickname, guys. And anyways, Ryoka’s faster. I wonder if she’s got some sort of Skill?”\nPersua’s face soured. Garia scratched at her head.\n“Now that you mention it…she’s never mentioned what level she is. She must be high-level, though.”\n“Well, she may be quick, but she’s not running now, is she? Besides, she’s so\nun\npleasant. Who’d want a Runner who never smiles like her?”\nGaria winced as Persua glared at her from behind Fals. For his part, Fals made a face and took a deliberate step next to Garia, preventing her from being shunted further away.\n“Right. About that. I know Ryoka broke a few rules recently, but she\nis\na good runner. And we need all the Runners we can get. I hope the [Healer] can sort her out, I really do.”\nHe smiled at Persua, and the younger girl sighed and turned red as he met her eyes.\n“So…Persua. I don’t want you or your friends to bother Ryoka again, okay?”\nShe sulked and pouted, but then gave Fals a sickly smile. He returned it with a slight wince that she didn’t appear to notice.\n“\nAnything\nfor you, Fals. Not that we did anything to Ryoka in the first place or anything. She just happened to have an…accident.”\n“Well, let’s not have any more of those, are we clear? We’re all on the same team, right?”\nFals raised his voice a bit, lightly, and he met Persua’s gaze, and Claudeil and Toriska nodded along. Yet Garia saw Fals’ eyes fix on Persua—then glance away.\nThe other Runners nodded and voiced their agreement. Fals went around the room shaking hands and slapping Runners on the back. He eventually managed to get Persua to clear off by hinting that she and her cronies smelled sweaty, and finally, he and Garia were left alone again. He sighed but smiled at Garia.\nHe had to know she’d done it.\nAnd how badly Ryoka was hurt. And that was all…? He glanced at Garia and shook his head slightly as he came over.\n“See what I mean, though? We can’t be divided. Us Runners have to work together.”\nGaria glared at Fals. She whispered out of the corner of her mouth.\n“You\nknow\nshe was behind it. Everyone does. She probably lied on the truth stones!”\nHe looked uncomfortable. Fals kicked at the ground with his expensive leather shoes and sighed. He combed his hair with one hand as he addressed Garia.\n“Ryoka broke a rule. They shouldn’t have gone that far, but I did warn her. We’ve got to work together, Garia. Even if one of us is faster, it’s better to share the wealth rather than compete. You’re new, but you understood that. Ryoka didn’t and now—well, now we’ve got trouble with Lady Magnolia\nand\nwe’re down a City Runner. Besides—Persua did what she did. I don’t want\nyou\nbeing her next target.”\nOr him? Then Garia realized how Fals always gave Persua the time of day might not be because he liked everyone. Was he—\nAfraid of her? Fals watched Persua carefully as she sniffed at an armpit and shoved Claudeil, who offered her a vial of scented oil. She waved back with a huge smile. Fals returned it before giving Garia a serious look for a moment.\nHe was.\nBecause maybe he feared she’d break his leg too. This didn’t sit well with Garia. She grimaced and stared hard at Fals. But when he met her gaze with a rueful smile and shrug, she colored and looked away. She muttered at the ground.\n“I still don’t like it. Persua’s crazy. Ryoka won’t be able to run for at least a\nyear\n! Even with potions to help her heal! Have you seen her leg?”\nFals hesitated.\n“I heard it was just a bad break that the [Healers] can’t fix right away. Is it worse than that?”\nGaria looked miserable as she shook her head.\n“I don’t know. I’m no expert, and she’s got it wrapped in layers of bandages. They look magical though, and—and I met a mage who said that the only way she’d get it healed was to pay hundreds of gold coins to a high-level [Healer].”\nHe\nhissed\nthrough his teeth.\n“That’s—\nno!\nI can’t believe it! They\ntold\nme they wouldn’t—”\nGaria interrupted Fals.\n“You\nknew?\nYou knew and—I can’t believe you, Fals!”\nGaria’s voice rose incredulously. She advanced on Fals, making fists with her hands. He raised his hands defensively as he backed away towards the counter.\n“I had no choice! Look, you know what Persua and her friends are like. I told them not to do anything drastic, but even if I’d stopped them, some other Runners would have organized something. You\nknow\nthe rules, Garia. Remember Perial when he broke them?”\nGaria remembered Perial. She didn’t remember what he’d done wrong, but she remembered that a bunch of Runners had dropped rusty nails in his path and forced him to run through them.\nFals closed his eyes tightly and then opened them. He looked tired.\n“Okay. That changes things. Look, Garia. I’ll—I’ll talk to the Guildmaster after I see it in person. Persua’s gone too far, even if Ryoka broke the rules.”\n“That still won’t fix her leg.”\n“No, but it’s all I can do. Okay? And I don’t know that any injury would really cost a hundred gold coins for a spell, Garia. I’ll see Ryoka myself, but even if her bones are broken beyond a healing potion’s ability to repair, how bad could it really be?”\n“It’s bad.”\n“We’ll see. I know a few good [Healers] and even a [Mage] that owes me a favor. If Ryoka’s really hurt that bad, I’ll call in a few favors and get the Guild to help out. She’ll be on her feet by the end of the month, I promise. But can we see what the commotion is?”\nGaria nodded. She felt a lot more upbeat with Fals’ promise. He always kept his word. She followed him to the counter as the Runners parted for him. Fals addressed a harried-looking receptionist at the counter.\n“What’s going on? Is there more trouble with Magnolia?”\n“Trouble? Oh, there’s been trouble alright.”\nThe receptionist laughed somewhat hysterically. She was Stenei, the [Receptionist] who’d often talked to Ryoka—and it seemed like she’d been called in just to speak to Lady Reinhart. Judging by her expression, that had not been pleasant.\n“Lady Magnolia was here just half an hour ago. She came\nin\nperson\nto complain to the Guildmaster, but he was out! She wanted to know where Ryoka was, and when she heard she was injured, she was\nnot happy.\nShe even suggested that she might stop ordering through our Guild altogether!”\nGaria and Fals stared in horror at the receptionist. Lady Magnolia was one of the Guild’s biggest patrons. Besides that, she was important. Even on the other end of the continent, there were people who would know her name.\n“Did she want anything else?”\n“She wanted to know where Ryoka was right now. Fortunately, we at least knew her address, so she was\nsomewhat\nsatisfied, but what will we do? If she stops ordering—”\nGaria interrupted urgently.\n“Wait, she wanted to know where Ryoka was?”\nThe receptionist blinked at her. Normally, Garia would have been brushed off in an instant, but Fals was with her.\n“Yes, she wanted to know.”\n“And you\ntold\nher?”\nThe receptionist grew defensive at Garia’s accusatory tone.\n“What? It’s in the guild’s best interest to keep her happy. If she wants to know where one of our Runners is, we’ll tell her.”\n“But she wanted\nRyoka!\nAnd if she knows where she is, she’ll go and meet her!”\nFals groaned and pulled at his hair. He looked around frantically, but Magnolia was already long gone.\n“Have you even\nmet\nRyoka? Remember what happened when she met the Guildmaster? She doesn’t respect anyone! If Magnolia shows up, she’ll probably throw her out of her room! Or—or—”\n“Punch her.”\nFals turned to Garia.\n“No. She wouldn’t do that. No one’s crazy enough to punch—she wouldn’t.”\nGaria looked nervous.\n“She punched a\nMinotaur\nwhen he tried to invite himself into her room this morning.”\nThe receptionist and Fals both paled.\n“We’ve got to stop her. Or stop Ryoka.”\n“Follow me!”",

    "text": "Lady Magnolia sat in the small, cramped bedroom of The Rat’s Tail, a moderately prosperous inn in the city of Celum. She clearly did not belong there. For one thing, her expensive, patterned, latticed, light pink dress with floral embroidery probably cost more than the inn itself.\nBut she sat on the rickety chair the innkeeper had personally delivered to Ryoka’s room, looking perfectly content while she chatted with its inhabitant. Behind her, Ressa the head maid stood in one corner of the room, glaring daggers at the poverty, the dirt under the windowsill, and Ryoka herself.\n“My dear, I really was shocked to hear of your accident. Won’t you tell me what happened?”\n“I got bored and played tag with a cart.”\n“You are\nalways\nfull of unique answers, aren’t you, Ryoka? I can’t imagine how you can tell jokes in the face of such an injury.”\nNot that Lady Magnolia had actually seen her injury, Ryoka reflected. She was lying on her bed, her bandages wrapped around her leg. Magnolia had walked in on her while she was resting, and Ryoka hadn’t yet unwrapped her protective cushion from her bad leg.\nShe didn’t know why she was spitting bile. The [Innkeeper] had practically bowed himself into a wall, and everyone was treating Magnolia like, well, a [Lady]. Ryoka felt like she should be grateful anyone cared enough to check on her.\nBut the agony in her leg made her want to curse everyone away. She tried to sit up, and Lady Magnolia raised a quick hand.\n“Lie still, please, Miss Griffin. Ressa, how good are those potions?”\nThe [Maid] was checking Ryoka’s room. She put down a bottle and shook her head.\n“Serviceable. But she’s not going to cure that with potions. The bones’re crushed.”\n“Could you set them…?”\n“Nope. This would require the best [Healer] the\nGuild\nhas—or something better. It’s shattered bone in splinters. Whoever did this knew how to stop it from being repaired.”\nRyoka stared sickly at her legs, and the [Maid] actually gave her a sympathetic look. Magnolia Reinhart exhaled.\n“Then it was deliberate.”\n“Not according to the Guild. The [Guildmaster] himself personally told me what a tragic accident this was. Completely my fault.”\nRyoka had screamed insults at him and thrown everything she could find. She expected Magnolia to take this at face value, but the [Lady] smiled instead.\nA cold smile. Ryoka blinked as she saw the green eyes focus on her—and then on Ryoka’s legs.\n“Show me your leg, my dear? Ressa can unwrap the bandages just for a moment.”\n“It’s…”\n“Just for one moment, Miss Ryoka. As a matter of…justice.”\nRyoka stared at her. Then she pointed to the left one.\n“Pull the bandages loose there—aah…”\nEven unwrapping it a bit made Ryoka feel her flesh begin to\npart.\nRessa was deft—she unwrapped the bandages fast, and Magnolia Reinhart looked down, and Ryoka stared at her legs—then turned her head.\nThe [Lady] didn’t\nquite\nvomit, but a [Maid] held out a bucket—Magnolia Reinhart swallowed calmly.\nA leg should not look—flat.\nEven with the skin regrown, the bones, the very structure of the leg—\n“Thank you, Ressa. And thank you, Miss Griffin. Do you need another potion?”\n“A bit.”\nRessa poured some on her leg, and Ryoka sat back as it was bound up again. Magnolia Reinhart had not gone dead white, but her lips were pale. She was more composed than Ryoka expected anyone to be after seeing a gruesome injury like that. One of the maids in the inn had seen Ryoka’s leg and fainted.\n“So that was the accident the Runner’s Guild informed me of. One leg, crushed by a wagon whose driver did not see you and had no time to stop. Which is fair. How, pray…were you\nlying\ndown long enough for your leg to be run over?”\n“According to the guild, I fell down.”\n“That is what their report claimed. The same young woman who broke a local record running gelato to my door—fell with a wagon rolling towards her and never rolled out of the way? Just so I ask your side of the story, did that all happen too fast, Miss Griffin?”\nRyoka looked at Magnolia, and those eyes regarded her. Searching…and Ryoka spoke.\n“No. I couldn’t get out of the way. Mostly because my feet were webbed down.”\n“I see. And how did you fall to begin with?”\n“Someone pushed or tripped me.”\nMagnolia Reinhart nodded.\n“That would be…Persua Mavva. Among others, yes?”\nRyoka Griffin blinked. Magnolia Reinhart waited, and the City Runner croaked.\n“Y-yeah. But she’s been absolved. Investigated, I mean.”\n“By Celum’s Guildmaster. No, I quite understand. The Guildmaster—when he arrived—assured me that he had looked into the accident. And it was an accident. And that he had truth stone readings. Ressa, how does Miss Griffin look?”\n“Truthful.”\nRessa showed Magnolia the same glowing stone, and Magnolia studied the blue glow.\n“Thank you. Well, Miss Ryoka, you are badly hurt. I will not waste your time. I wanted to check on you, and I am sorry that I did not hear of this sooner. I was preoccupied…”\n“I didn’t expect you to remember me.”\n“No?”\nMagnolia raised one eyebrow. Ryoka laughed.\n“I’m just a Runner who knows how to make ice cream. Did you want to make more?”\n“No, Miss Griffin. I was hoping we’d speak again.”\n“Ah. That. Well—I’m sort of laid up. You came all this way because you were curious?”\nCurious she was from another world?\nTo Ryoka’s surprise, Magnolia Reinhart’s eyes flashed.\n“I won’t deny my curiosity, Miss Griffin. But I hope you would think more of me than that. The Runner’s Guild has clearly misrepresented the truth, and this City Runner has committed a crime. In Celum, which is not ruled by me, but in\nIzril\n, which I hold near and dear to my heart, despite its warts and wrinkles. The Runner’s Guild must not be corrupt.”\n“Well. They’ve done their investigation, and that’s that.”\nRyoka felt like they were talking in circles. She licked her lips, and Magnolia Reinhart reached out and handed her the refilled canteen of water.\n“Not quite. I believe Guildmaster Eterell was a good City Runner in his time. He rose through the ranks, and his current job and class in one of the more central Runner’s Guilds has made him fairly wealthy. Too wealthy, and perhaps\ntoo\ncomfortable. Which is why, tomorrow, he will step down from his position. Perhaps, in his advancing years, he will find work starting as a Street Runner. Or some other job. I believe that would be for the best.”\nRyoka Griffin’s lips froze with cool water pressed against them. She turned her head, and Magnolia went on.\n“His successor will have to investigate the Guild’s dealings. But as for Miss Mavva—she is a somewhat well-connected City Runner. She and her close friends have more Street Runners in common, though. If she passes the second investigation, regardless, I believe they will have more success with their peers as Street Runners. And the new Guildmaster may suggest they find other modes of work as well.”\n“You…what are you talking about?”\nMagnolia Reinhart looked at Ryoka with a pleasant smile on her face. But her eyes were sparking with real anger.\n“Merely a forecast, Miss Griffin. Consider me a [Weather Mage] of sorts—albeit for people.”\n“Why are you…?”\n“Whatever do you mean, Miss Griffin?”\nThe [Lady] gave Ryoka an innocent look as Ressa snorted softly. But not disapprovingly. Magnolia Reinhart stared out Ryoka’s window at the city beyond.\n“Are you, perhaps, surprised that anyone might take an interest in wrongdoing? Or deal with the matters themselves? If a Guild rots from within—the city suffers. The region suffers. If I were to find a poison within the veins of Izril, should I ignore it? Monsters, threats. Wrongdoing. Someone must deal with the situation. Don’t you agree?”\nShe turned to Ryoka, and the young woman laughed at her.\n“What about the law? The…Watch? Having some random vigilante doesn’t sound like the system’s working.”\nMagnolia’s smile never changed, but the look in her eyes deepened, crossing with something like regret.\n“Oh, I wonder where you come from, Miss Griffin, I truly do. The Watch? Who oversees the Watch? Who holds my peers to account? Who should but stop an army, an invading force?\nSometimes, Miss Griffin\n,\nwe make such choices and do what we must.\n”\nRyoka felt a shiver cross her spine, and Magnolia Reinhart glanced at Ressa—and the ‘[Maid]’ said nothing at all. But then Magnolia blinked, sighed, and fluttered her hands.\n“…Until we regret it. These are more peaceful times, Miss Griffin, so we shall simply slap some hands and deal with such troublemakers lightly. Lighter than you would prefer, I’m sure. But you have my word.”\nIn that moment, Ryoka wasn’t sure if she liked Magnolia or she just found her to be unexpected. But she…more than anyone else Ryoka had met—she looked at Magnolia and said something she had rarely spoken in any world.\n“Thank you.”\nMagnolia Reinhart shook her head.\n“Thanks would go to me if I stopped this from occurring, Miss Griffin. This is just—necessity. Now. I will take a little more of your time. What will happen to your leg? Do the [Healers] have any hope it will mend with time? Better potions?”\nRyoka’s moment of lightness fell away again. She bowed her head.\n“No. There’s no chance. Not unless I find some kind of super-healer. Is there one…?”\nShe looked up, remembering the comment about some Guild’s best [Healer]. But Ressa just coughed.\n“He’s about seven hundred miles away and unlikely to…”\nSeven hundred miles?\nRyoka bowed her head, but Magnolia waved her fingers.\n“Yes, yes. I understand the difficulties there. This sounds like it requires top-tier healing. So. A Potion of Regeneration from an older age, a [Healer] beyond compare…hundreds of thousands of gold pieces and months of rehabilitation, even so. But these were unenchanted wagon wheels, weren’t they? In that case—I believe the simplest answer would be the Healer of Tenbault.”\nRyoka had heard that name before. Ressa grimaced.\n“She is busy, Lady Reinhart.”\n“She always is. But she owes me a favor. And as for the cost—Miss Griffin, I believe you are not without recourse. I happen to have an old…ah, friend. Someone who is capable of casting a spell that will likely heal your leg. [Restoration]. Healing magic, one of the rarest kinds in the world. A Tier 6 spell, in fact.”\nMagnolia smiled brightly at her.\nRyoka stared blankly at Magnolia, not quite daring to believe what she was hearing. Tier…what was that? Then she remembered what she’d read from an introductory spellbook.\nTier Magic. It stood in stark contrast to the undisciplined magics, whatever that meant. But from what Ryoka had read in her extremely brief introduction to magic, Tiered Magic organized magic in…tiers.\nThat was to say that a spell capable of being cast by all mages was generally thought of as 1st Tier Magic or 0 Tier Magic, while a spell that was 2nd Tier was more potent, requiring a better mage and longer periods of study to learn it. 3rd Tier magic was generally the bar for most mages, and they would know only one or two spells of that level. Anything higher got into the range of extremely powerful magic, exponentially stronger and just as hard to learn.\nThat presumably meant that Magnolia’s friend was an incredible mage, but the book had said lower-level mages could cast higher Tier magic with enough practice and time. It also meant this mysterious friend was probably extremely powerful.\n“You—you just know someone who has that kind of power? Really? And she’ll just pop over to heal me?”\n“My dear. I know everyone and anyone who matters in the north. Nor will she pop over.”\nMagnolia sighed.\n“…But we can arrange transit and put you ahead on her list. I\nbelieve\nyour leg will heal. In which case, we shall resolve all of this.”\nIt felt like it was all unreal. Ryoka’s head was spinning. Persua—punished. Her leg? Her head rose, and Magnolia gave her a pat on the hand.\n“If that all sounds acceptable, we will have you in my carriage within the hour and heading to Tenbault—which is her city. Then I believe you’ll likely need to rest even with that spell, and my mansion is open to you rather than this—colorful inn. Especially for healing, you should have clean bedsheets.”\n“And a chamberpot.”\nRessa added. Ryoka croaked.\n“I—you’d do that? Why?”\nMagnolia\npsshed\n.\n“Miss Griffin, you did render me the invaluable, nay, indispensable boon of\nfree ice cream.\nShouldn’t I repay that kindness? But if you insist—I do hope you and I will have a proper chat while you recover. About where you came from. And how you got here.”\nShe said that last part so gently Ryoka almost missed it. Then her head rose, and Magnolia was looking her in the eyes.\nGreen and green, but the forest was swallowing up the emeralds of Ryoka’s gaze.\n“I am—exceptionally curious, my dear. If you would be candid, I would be most grateful. Which land do you call home? What useful—tidbits could you share?”\nSuddenly, Ryoka felt the walls closing in. She looked at Magnolia Reinhart, and the [Lady] was watching her.\n“Wh-what are you talking about?”\n“Come now, Miss Griffin. I am not angry. In fact, I believe this was all a great accident. I just need to know—where and who sent you. And how many there are. If this\nwas\nan accident, all well and good. But if you are a visitor kith and kin from, say, the domain of the Winter Sprites or some other nation—I need to know everything.”\nThen Magnolia was looking at her, and the young woman from Earth was frozen in her bed. She felt cold suddenly, even in the sheets.\n“I—I don’t know what—”\nEarth.\nMagnolia Reinhart, the Deadly Flower of the North,\nknew,\nsomehow, she wasn’t from here. And—and she wanted to know…\nRyoka had a flash, suddenly, of the Watch with their spears and the adventurers with their swords and bows holding guns. She looked at Magnolia, a war hero, perhaps, a [Lady] with a\nlot\nof connections fascinated with gelato.\nAnd she wondered what that kind of [Lady], even one who believed in justice, would do if she knew how to make a gun.\nMagnolia saw Ryoka suddenly tense up.\n“My dear. Perhaps I’m wrong. But would you care to elaborate on the situation? Perhaps I am completely wrong and you have a Skill and you’re actually an Izrilian and\nthat would be hilarious.\n”\nShe laughed—but she was glancing at Ryoka. At something lying on the bedside table. Ryoka turned her head and went paler still.\nHer iPhone was lying there with its worn casing, and Ressa and Magnolia glanced at it. Magnolia continued after a second—\n“…But I do safeguard Izril in some small ways. Honesty, Miss Griffin. Just a short chat on the ride there and afterwards. How about it? Do we have a deal?”\nShe held out a hand, and Ryoka Griffin looked at Magnolia Reinhart’s smiling face. She felt her leg beginning to scream at her again, and she wanted nothing in this world more than the pain to stop. Her hand rose—\nAnd she thought she heard a poem in her head.\nShe saw a flash of gunfire and wondered what would have happened if any historical figure in history had ever been handed an assault rifle or the blueprints for one.\nRyoka Griffin had little moral fiber. She hated authority. She hated a lot of things, including her parents. But she had studied history and modern events, and she looked at Magnolia Reinhart and that outstretched hand. Ryoka Griffin’s mouth went dry.\n“No. Not that.”\nMagnolia blinked. Her fingers wavered.\n“No? Miss Griffin—your leg is in a distressing state. I cannot bear to see you in pain another second. Please, let’s forgo your admittedly successful reticence and mystery. I shall tell the Healer to speak to you then—”\n“No. I’ll take the healing—but not tell you—tell you everything. I’ll tell you a bit, okay? But nothing more.”\nThe [Lady] of House Reinhart blinked at Ryoka.\n“I—beg your pardon?”\n“How about where I came from? And—twenty questions.”\n“Twenty questions?”\n“Sure. Ask me any twenty questions and I’ll answer them. How—how about that?”\nRyoka Griffin smiled weakly, and Magnolia Reinhart turned to look at Ressa. She looked back down at Ryoka.",

A large number, to be sure, by some standards, but the cost of visiting her is in the thousands of gold pieces on average—hundreds if you are lucky. The nobility have a hard time visiting her. I believe I should get more than twenty questions.”\n“Well—take it or leave it.”\nRyoka smiled at Magnolia, trying to keep her face straight. She saw Magnolia’s mouth open and Ressa’s glare, but she clenched her fists in the sheets. Not guns. Not…not the worst of what Magnolia could learn.\nShe waited for Magnolia to come up with another offer. Forty questions maybe. But the [Lady] just stared down at Ryoka and shook her head.\n“My dear. My dear Ryoka—I have given you a lot of leeway. This accident was not your fault, nor do I take any pleasure in this, but your…what? Principle? Stubbornness? It must end somewhere. No.”\nRyoka saw her step back. The City Runner looked up.\n“No? What do you mean?”\n“No. I will not negotiate with you. Not questions. Not a deal, Miss Griffin. Candor, complete candor—simply\ntalk\nto me and the Healer will mend your leg. If not?”\nMagnolia folded her hands as she stood in the doorway. She looked at Ryoka, and the young woman stared at her.\n“You’re not going to heal me?”\n“I am going to mend your leg—but not waste more time, Miss Griffin. Please, I urge you to accept my offer.”\n“N-no.”\nThe [Lady] gave Ryoka an incredulous look, but the young woman was giving her almost the same expression.\n“I won’t be bullied into telling you anything.”\n“\nBullied?\n”\nMagnolia’s voice rose in outrage. She turned to Ressa.\n“I—\nMiss Griffin.\nI am trying to help you.”\n“Then heal me and don’t threaten me.”\nRyoka bared her teeth, and Magnolia Reinhart was lost for words.\n“She’s got you there.”\n“Ressa, do shut up. Miss Griffin, this is the smallest thing I could ask for. The most\nnecessary\nthing—please consider.”\n“No.”\nRyoka took some joy in seeing Magnolia’s pure, flummoxed shock. The [Lady] stood in the doorway and turned to her silent servants, back to Ryoka—and then she bowed her head.\n“Very well, Miss Griffin. You win.”\nThe City Runner exhaled—but too soon. Magnolia Reinhart slowly put her hand on the doorknob.\n“Wh—what are you—”\n“I shall keep an open ear for any letter you send. When you change your mind—and I hope for your sake it is soon—contact me.”\nThen, politely, regretfully, and without hesitation, Magnolia Reinhart closed the door on Ryoka Griffin. And the young woman stared at the closed door before she began to shout—but Magnolia Reinhart was already walking down the stairs.",

    "text": "I’m an idiot. I have to cover my eyes to keep the tears from leaking. I’m such a complete and utter, stubborn idiot.\nI should have accepted her offer immediately. No—even if Magnolia wanted me to be her slave or her maid or to work for her for ten years, I would have accepted her offer in a heartbeat.\nBut she wanted me to tell her the truth. Damn it. Damn her and her insight. That’s the one thing I can’t give her. Ever.\nMy leg is agony. But my heart is ice. And now that I’ve been given the offer, the path is clear. Two roads stretch out before me, and a world waits upon my choice.\nIs that dramatic? It’s too dramatic. But it is true.\nStand up. I need another healing potion. My leg hurts—I need a clear head for it.\nI shift to reach for the nightstand. Pain shoots through my bad leg. Three healing potions. Damn it, again. I can’t waste them. Not if—\nWell if I refuse, there’s no point to them. They’re weak things, anyways. But they told me a stronger healing potion would start growing each fragment of bone out of my skin, and that would destroy my leg beyond any healing.\nSomething. Oh. I reach over, cursing my leg, and grip it tightly in one hand. The only thing I really own in this world. It’s useless, without power. At least the earbuds are still attached, but again, useless without electricity.\nI look at the piece of plastic and metal lying on the nightstand. Stupid to have it out. Could I trade that, instead? Even if she figures out how to use it, she couldn’t replicate it. Maybe…\nNo. No, it’s worthless in any case. If there were power left in it, I might be able to make the trade but—no. It’s information she wants. And that price is just too high for me to pay.\n“Information.”\nThe word rots on my tongue. It sounds so stupid, so simple and easy to give away when you say it like that. And it would be simple for me to agree to answer however many questions.\nExcept that Magnolia can read minds. Or sense untruths. And she’s cunning, smart enough to keep asking questions. If I gave her unlimited answers, she’d have the entire truth eventually.\nI could lie. But she’d sense it if I didn’t intend to fulfill my bargain. Trapped, again.\nPride be damned. I’ll go back and beg her if need be. The cost—I’ll think of it later. But even if it means selling part of my soul or my world’s secrets, I will run again.\nBut…no. I can’t do that. No, never. Because if she asks questions—\nIf she asks questions, she’ll learn about my world. Good? That’s fine. Even if she knows, can she get there so easily? I don’t think it matters. If someone could travel between worlds so easily, we’d already know about it. Maybe she could, but we have guns and way more technology than she does.\nBut that’s the catch, isn’t it? We have technology, and if she asks more questions, she’ll know about our world’s technology. Not just things like hygiene or bacteria, but the things that should never be told. Secrets, jumps forward in capability that would make any nation a superpower in an instant.\nGunpowder. Firearms. Germ warfare. Steam power, electrical power, locomotion. Everything from interrogation techniques to how to build a tank or a bomb. Nuclear weapons.\nDoes it sound stupid to say it like that? I don’t know how to make nukes. But I do know what goes into gunpowder. I aced chemistry class. I know exactly how a turbine works, and I’m pretty damn sure I remember all of the techniques the FBI illegally used on terrorists.\nDamn it. It’s a moral choice, isn’t it? Lose my leg or give away the secrets of death and destruction. If it were anyone else, I could lie or tell only small truths. But she can read my damn mind. And I know exactly where to gather all the ingredients of gunpowder. And guns wouldn’t be hard to make, not in this world.\nLady Magnolia. I know nothing about her. Just rumors and that she’s a powerful and influential lady with wealth and connections. Even if she appears nice—especially if she appears nice—I have no way of knowing if she’d use that power to help or harm.\nNo. It’s simpler than that.\nEven if I could trust her, the secret would spread. That’s how it works. She’d want to see a demonstration, and someone would put the pieces together. Ressa, her maid, maybe. Sooner or later, technology would spread. I’d be responsible for bringing guns into the world. And maybe it’s not that far away from that level of technology already but—\n“Belfast. Beruit. Phnom Penh. All flesh is grass.”\nWhen I was a girl, I went to the Newseum in Washington D.C. I saw the pictures on the walls. I looked at the children, the dying and the dead. My dad thought I was too young to understand.\nAll flesh is grass. The ‘War Photographer’ by Carol Ann Duffy. Is it a straight line between bringing the capabilities of gunpowder to the world and terrible war? No. But where there is knowledge, there is power. And even if she used her power to help her nation, that would only lead to war in the end.\nNapalm. Mixed petroleum with a natural or synthesized rubber like latex. It wouldn’t be hard to create the same kind of thing. Not with Magnolia’s influence.\nI want to run. I want to walk again.\nI’m no Walter White, but I remember too much. Too much National Geographic and other shows about the world. Not a perfect memory. But too close.\nDamn it. I can’t do it. I don’t want to be the one who creates a Hitler or gives another white…woman a gun and a mandate to conquer the world. But I want to run.\nI can’t figure it out. I can’t decide. I waited a week—a damn\nweek\nfor her to arrive. In pain and fear. And now that she offered me what I was dreaming of, I should have leapt at it. But I hesitate. I draw back.\nI sit on the edge of the abyss and wonder if my soul burns well in hell. It’s not fair. All I ever wanted to do was run. I don’t want to lose my leg. I want to run. I want to live. I want to walk.\nI don’t want to see the child sitting alone. I don’t want to see the vulture. I don’t want it to be my fault.\nAlone, I sit in my room, sitting with the fate of two worlds in my hands. This world’s and my world’s. I live to run. My legs are what define me.\nAll I have to do is ask the staff to get me a Street Runner. Or send a note to Magnolia Reinhart. She’s probably not too far from the city, if she’s even left yet. It would be so simple, and I wouldn’t be in pain.\nIt would—\nThe door opens. I look up. A face like perfection and a dream stares at me. Half perfection, half mortal. The cruelest of both worlds. Ceria Springwalker.\nShe hesitates and then steps into the room. I expect hollow words and hollower promises. I expect to be let down or to feel nothing but despair. But she doesn’t bring any of that.\nShe brings salvation.",

    "text": "“I know it’s bad.”\nRyoka sat on the bed. Ceria stared at her leg and then looked away.\n“I’ve seen an injury like that before. I’m aware it can’t be healed so easily. I’m not sure if your friend really understood—”\n“She doesn’t. It doesn’t matter. She can’t help. Neither can you.”\n“We owe you a debt. You might not understand it, but Calruz hired every member of the Horns of Hammerad because we believe in honor. If we can help, we will.”\nRyoka bared her teeth.\n“Got a few thousand gold coins?”\n“No. That’s beyond us, frankly. Even if we sold our armor and weapons—and Calruz might, to impress you—I doubt we’d be able to get close to a [Healer] of that level. They’re in constant demand. Heard of the Healer of Tenbault?”\nRyoka started, and Ceria nodded.\n“I’ve never seen her, but I know it’s virtually impossible to meet her—and everyone wants to, because she can apparently cure almost anything. Thousands camp around the gates of Tenbault each day, hoping she’ll tend to them. Even if we had the money they charge, it would take a miracle.”\nRyoka grunted. Her hand was clutching the sheets of her bed so hard they were white. Instead, Ceria looked at Ryoka. Ryoka gazed back.\nWhat the young woman saw, Ceria could guess. A half-breed, perhaps. A memory of what was lost, or maybe she just saw a mage, someone who pursued strange goals few understood. It didn’t matter. And for some reason, Ceria thought that the Runner known as Ryoka Griffin looked at her differently than the rest. But duty was duty. Honor was honor.\n“I heard Magnolia Reinhart visited you. Did she offer you anything?”\n“She offered me a deal. I might have to take it. And damn my soul. Why am I responsible? I’m not. It’s not my…”\nRyoka stared down at the sheets. Wrestling with something. Ceria raised her brows and coughed.\n“Before you do, be careful. My peo—\nI\ndon’t trust the nobility.”\nCeria glanced sidelong at Ryoka, as if hoping for a confirmation. Ryoka grunted.\n“I don’t trust anyone. Not with some things. They’ll…they’ll let you down.”\nShe looked haunted, torn—and strangely—principled. It was funny, but Ceria had heard that the City Runner who’d delivered the potions to her team hadn’t asked what they were offering for their emergency delivery.\nThe Horns had posted the highest number they dared, but it had been way too low for someone to risk a\nLich\nkilling them. But one Runner had come without even asking the price.\nStrange, to find someone like that. It reminded the half-Elf of her bull-headed leader, Calruz. And her team. It made her want to help Ryoka, so she leaned forwards and took a breath.\n“I know that Lady Magnolia offered you…something. I saw her on the way in. You might want to accept, but all deals have a price. Even if she doesn’t say, she’ll want something.”\n“I know. But—”\nRyoka was staring at her legs, and Ceria knew what she was thinking. No matter what it was—if the choice was between never walking again and healing? That was why the half-Elf was here. Ceria lowered her voice.\n“A spell is probably the only way to cure your leg. But there’s magic that she offers and then there’s…another way.”\n“Another way?”\nRyoka looked at Ceria. Her eyes seemed to pierce the young half-Elf to her core. Ceria Springwalker had lived for over sixty years, but she hadn’t ever seen someone as desperate as Ryoka.\n“Tell me.”\nThe eyes seemed to be boring a path straight into her soul. Ceria took a deep breath. She might regret this. She already was. But she thought of—the person she had considered when they were discussing Ryoka’s plight. Maybe that bastard was dead. She almost wished…no. No, and the odds were he was somewhere on Izril still. He’d never go back to Terandria or Wistram.\nShe had vowed never to speak to him again, but for this odd young woman in need, Ceria Springwalker closed her eyes and then asked Ryoka a question.\n“…How do you feel about necromancy?”\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "After a few days, Erin concluded that she had three types of customers. The first type were the Antinium, namely Pawn and the Workers. He brought them every day or every other day as soon as the sun touched the tops of the mountains in the southwest.\nThe sun rose and fell in the same direction as back home, which was either a coincidence or something interesting. Erin felt stupid for not noticing earlier, but then, she didn’t carry around a compass, did she? At least it was still east to west.\nThe Workers arrived like clockwork each evening, many bringing chess sets of paper or stone. Apparently, Workers\ndid\nearn some kind of pay, and they spent their money exclusively on chess and food.\nErin felt bad about that, especially given the price she charged for Acid Flies. But Pawn told her that before this, the Workers didn’t claim any of their weekly stipends. The ones who worked in the city\nwere\nallocated some money, but it had never occurred to any of them to spend it, so in that sense, Erin was helping them become consumers.\nBesides, they ate like pigs. Starving pigs with a taste for crunchy flies.\nDespite their obsession with her food, the Antinium were polite, quiet except when they were eating, and played chess. In other words, Erin would have been glad to have them over every night.\nThe second kind of guest she got were the Goblins. They were like the Workers but smellier, dirtier, and they paid her with coins covered in blood, dirt, and occasionally—\nErin had instituted a policy in her inn. Goblins had to jump in the stream or at least wash themselves before they were allowed in. Not that many visited. In truth, it was just Rags and her posse.\nAnd it\nwas\na posse. Or a group. Or gang. Erin was sure she was the leader of whatever they were, but while Rags was in command, it was also clear that she wasn’t in charge of her tribe, if there was still a tribe.\nOccasionally, the small Goblin would come in alone, but often, she had two bigger Goblins following her. They were almost always injured—not seriously, but with small wounds that suggested scuffles and fighting. Erin wondered if the reason she didn’t see more Goblins was because they were recovering from injuries.\nShe wondered how many had died. Erin had slept with her windows and shutters locked and waited to see if more Goblins would—come back.\nNone did, and the small group that had fought for Erin had lurked around until Erin offered them food. She didn’t know how many were left of the ones who had killed Klbkch. She didn’t know if\nany\nwere left, but she waited. Selys and Krshia had offered to put her up in Liscor, but Erin was staying.\nIt felt like it was the only thing she could do. So her Goblin guests became that tiny group.\nNevertheless, Rags paid for her followers’ meals and her own and ate in silence. Occasionally, she played a game of chess, but Erin got the distinct impression the small Goblin was watching her.\nThat was fine, but Erin had grown…warier over the last few days. She always checked to make sure she knew how many Goblins were around her inn, and even when Rags was alone in her inn, Erin never left any knives or other weapons out in the open. She also made the Goblins leave whatever they were carrying outside the inn.\nStill, if the Goblins were an issue that occasionally made the Workers pause and Erin count the knives in her kitchen, they were still decent customers. They paid money, which was more than Erin could say for the last type of guest: annoying necromancer.",

    "text": "“Do you know how much money you owe me for all these meals?”\nPisces looked up, mouth bulging with soup. He swallowed, grabbed a piece of bread, and munched it down before replying.\n“I am, as always, reliant upon your good graces and tolerant nature, good Mistress Solstice. Rest assured, I will pay off my debts in due time as soon as I acquire the necessary funds.”\nErin planted her hands on her hips. The inn was empty except for Rags sitting in one corner, slurping down another bowl of soup.\n“You keep saying that, but do you actually have any money on you?”\nPisces raised his eyebrows.\n“What is money but a concept? If you are referring to the notion of money, I am indeed wealthy in—”\n“Coins. Do you have them?”\nThe [Necromancer] hesitated and lifted one delicate finger.\n“Not as such, no.”\nHe shrugged as Erin glared and went back to his soup. It was amazing how Pisces could manage to scarf down her food and still grimace at the same time.\n“I know you study magic all day, but would it kill you to get a job? Then you could\npay\nfor food instead of mooching it off me. And you could pay for someone to wash your robe, too!”\nPisces glanced down at his travel and food-stained robes. They were probably white, but constant use and little washing had rendered them colorfully gray and splotched.\n“I fail to see your point.”\n“Your clothes. Are filthy.”\nHe shrugged.\n“Do they emit any kind of unsavory smell?”\n“…No.”\n“Then once again, magic has eliminated another tiresome chore. As to your point about employment, I remind you that I am banned from entering Liscor due to my magical inclinations.”\n“And because you stole food and money from people by pretending to be a monster.”\nPisces rolled his eyes as if admitting one grudging good point.\n“That too, I suppose. Regardless, it behooves me to stay away from the Watch. Even this far from the city, I must occasionally evade their tiresome patrols.”\n“Well, you won’t have to do that much longer.”\nErin sighed and tossed her cleaning rag on the table next to Pisces. He eyed it and then her with sudden paranoia, and his eyes darted to a window.\n“What do you mean?”\n“Oh, they’re not going to patrol around the inn any longer. After—after Klbkch—anyways, the stupid Captain said she’s not going patrol this area. And Relc doesn’t hang out here now, so I guess you don’t have to worry about the Watch.”\nPisces repeated Erin’s words slowly. He relaxed and almost appeared cheerful—until he began to frown.\n“They aren’t patrolling this region any longer?”\n“That’s what I said.”\nHe scratched at his chin and glanced out the window. It was still morning, but Erin had closed most of the shutters. It was an unexpectedly chilly day today, and she didn’t feel like building a fire.\n“That would be…problematic.”\n“Oh? Why’s that?”\nPisces leaned back in his chair and fiddled with the spoon he was using. He stared at the ceiling, a sign Erin knew meant she was about to hear another lecture. Resigned, she picked up the bar rag and turned to clean another table.\nRags was sitting two tables over. Erin blinked as the Goblin quickly looked away. She hadn’t even heard the small Goblin move. Was she…listening in on Erin’s conversation with Pisces?\n“The local fauna and flora of the area around Liscor are not the most deadly, considering the extreme variance of some death zones around the world, but there are several notable monster types that do pose a serious threat, even to me.”\nErin glanced over at Pisces.\n“Even a great and glorious mage like you?”\n“Let us just say that several of the species around here deter adventurers from pursuing their trade. Not that Drakes and Gnolls tend towards adventuring as much in any case. But without the Watch to keep local populations down, it will become hazardous quite quickly. I would suggest you hire some form of protection before this occurs.”\n“What, like a bodyguard? I don’t have the money for that.”\nPisces shook his head.\n“I was referring to thugs with weapons aptly known as ‘bouncers’ or the more mundane [Mercenary] classes, but you do raise a good point. I doubt many would be willing to travel this far to offer protection—and even if they did, their prices would be quite exorbitant.”\n“That’s what I just said.”\n“Yes, well, regardless, some form of personal defense would be highly advisable.”\n“I can fight. I’ve got, uh, [Bar Fighting] as a Skill, you know. I can totally crack someone over the head with a chair.”\nPisces raised his eyebrows and applauded silently. Erin glared at him.\n“Most, ah, impressive. However, I doubt your prowess with a wooden chair would deter anything but the average Goblin. Most creatures are a tad studier than that, I fear.”\nThis time, both Rags and Erin glared at Pisces. He ignored Erin, but he seemed less sanguine about Rags, who had moved over to the table next to his. Gingerly, as if expecting her to bite, Pisces flapped one hand at Rags, who shied away from him.\n“Let me put it another way, Mistress Solstice. In words you may find easier to understand. Monsters, strong. You, weak. Regardless of your level, you have only the [Innkeeper] class, which has few Skills meant for fighting or survival.”\nPisces took another bite of bread and then reached for a cup as Erin fumed.\n“I’m not completely helpless, you know.”\n“I never said that you were. But fighting is far different from self-defense.”\nHe was right. In fact, Pisces was often right, but the problem was that he was so aggravating in being right that Erin didn’t like to admit it. She changed the subject to something she’d been waiting to bring up with him.\n“By the way, I learned a new Skill after the—the game.”\nPisces paused with his tankard to his lips.\n“Oh?”\n“It’s called [Immortal Moment]. I have no idea what it does.”\n“Hm.”\nHe frowned and took a deep drink, grimacing at the water in his cup.\n“I have not ever heard of such a Skill in any of the directories I have read during my time as a student. Nor have I heard of such a Skill at any point in my life. Have you found out what it does?”\n“Nope.”\nPisces shrugged again.\n“It sounds like quite a useless Skill, to be honest.”\n“That’s what I thought, too. But do you know if it has anything to do with chess? That’s probably where I learned it from.”\nHe thought about this as he drank.\n“It is possible, although Skills that focus on one task are generally easier to understand from their name. It is more likely that this is some kind of ability you gained during the course of the game. But as to what that might be or how such a Skill could be used—”\nHe turned up one hand and finished his drink. Then he scowled and\nplonked\nthe empty cup back on the table.\n“Do you not have any\nale?\nOr at least if you must serve drinks, would you do the courtesy of bringing out the Amentus beverage?”\nErin raised her eyebrows. Pisces pointedly glanced at his empty cup, and she more pointedly made no move to fill it.\n“People who pay their tabs get blue juice. And as for alcohol—I’m underage, you idiot. I’m only 20.”\nPisces stared at her incredulously as Erin glared at him over the counter.\n“Underage of\nwhat\n, precisely?”\n“The drinking age of cou—”\nErin stopped.\n“…Nevermind. Okay, yeah, I could buy alcohol, but it’s expensive.”\n“And customary for an inn.”\nErin thought for a second. She vaguely recalled something.\n“I do have [Alcohol Brewing] as a Skill. I guess I could…make alcohol?”\nOnce again, Pisces’ tone was laced with sarcasm.\n“Ah. I see having a Skill replaces the need for hops, barrels, the fermentation process, yeast, and of course the grain needed for such a beverage. Do show me how you make ‘alcohol,’ and let me know when you’ve decided on what type of ‘alcohol’ you would like to create. I would especially love to know if it’s a rum, beer, whiskey, mead, or if it is in fact a consumable alcohol at all.”\nErin glared at him. The odd thing was that she understood exactly what Pisces meant. The Skill in her head was telling her all kinds of crazy things, like how long she’d have to ferment the\nwort\nshe’d get after adding boiling water to grain, and all the supplies she’d need. And guess what? It turned out making alcohol was a\npain in the ass\n.\nShe just wished Pisces weren’t competing for that honor. Erin folded her arms as she reconsidered.\n“I can make wine too. Wine is easier.”\nHe shook his head.\n“I trust your expert opinion, of course. But may I recommend testing your drink out on the Goblins or perhaps the Antinium before serving it with your meals?”\nThis time, Rags\npoked\nPisces hard in the side. He yelped, swiped at her, and nearly fell out of his chair. He glared at Rags.\n“Mistress Solstice, please keep your\nguest\naway from me. Elsewise, I may be forced to use magic to remedy the problem myself.”\nHe waggled his fingers, and they emitted a few bright green sparks. Rags instantly scooted away from Pisces in alarm. Erin folded her arms and glared at him.\n“You’ll do no such thing if you want to eat here again. Stop bullying the Goblin, and stop insulting them while you’re at it. Besides, she’d probably beat you in a fight.”\n“I doubt that.”\nPisces muttered darkly, but he subsided back into his chair and began shoveling more soup into his mouth. Rags deliberately looked away from both Humans and pretended to be engrossed in picking at dried scabs on her side. Erin sighed. Touchy mages and inquisitive Goblins. She missed the Antinium already.\n“I get that the Workers and Goblins travel in groups and run away from monsters, but how do\nyou\nsurvive out here by yourself?”\nHe shrugged sulkily.\n“Any decent [Mage] has a number of spells to avoid detection. [Invisibility] is one of my fortes, for instance.”\n“Oh. Right. I forgot you could do that. You know a lot of spells, huh?”\n“I am quite adept in a number of magical fields. But yes, [Invisibility] is a 4th Tier spell I have acquired after much practice and study. It is useful in almost every situation.”\n“Like for what? Spying on people? Hey—you haven’t ever come in\nhere\nwhile you’re invisible, have you? Because if you have…”\nErin made a fist. Pisces raised both hands and made a face.\n“Perish the thought. I\ndo\nhave standards to adhere to, and besides which, you are aware that most [Mages] use the [Farsight] and [Scrying] spells to gaze with impunity on anyone they like, are you not?”\n“\nWhat?\n”\nErin looked at him in horror. Pisces smirked a bit.\n“Is it so surprising? Most upper-class dwellings and bath houses have spells to prevent such unwanted attention. But fear not—there are no Human [Mages] in the area besides myself, and I suspect any Drake [Mages], if any competent individuals in Liscor, would prefer their own species to gaze upon.”\nErin shivered.\n“That is the creepiest thought I’ve ever heard of. All of you mages are perverts, I swear.”\nHe looked indignant at that.\n“Magic is a sacred art, Miss Solstice. If a few use it to untoward ends, that is a small consequence that cannot be avoided. But to all others who pursue magic, the benefits are enormous. For instance,\nI\ndo not have to worry about monster attacks even should the Watch give up patrols in this area entirely.”\n“So you’re Mister Powerful, huh?”\n“You saw my effectiveness against the Acid Flies, did you not?”\nThat made Erin pause.\n“Oh. Yeah. You were pretty cool then. Um, thanks again.”\nPisces waved a hand at her and fixed his attention back on his soup quickly. Erin thought his cheeks were slightly pink. She smiled and had another thought.\n“Why don’t you teach me magic, then? I’ll get rid of your tab if you do.”\nThe [Mage] looked up from his soup and stared at Erin.\n“Teach you. Magic? Good Mistress—”\nShe glared.\n“Erin, then. You do realize that magic is not as simple as waving a wand about and chanting words, don’t you? Becoming a [Mage] such as myself requires years—sometimes decades of intensive study.”\n“I know.”\nErin didn’t actually know that, but it made sense. But now that the idea had hit her, she was suddenly caught up by it. Magic. It seemed so strange and incomprehensible and yet—\n“But, uh, can’t you teach me a bit of magic? I’d love to learn. I think mages are cool. I was a big fan of Harry Potter growing up, although Draco was sort of cute too—”\nPisces glanced at Rags and got a blank look in return.\n“…Who?”\nErin blushed.\n“Never mind. Forget that. But will you teach me something? It doesn’t even have to be a lot. I just want to learn about magic.”\nRags looked up and stopped picking at her scabs. Erin sensed the Goblin scooting closer from chair to chair as Pisces considered her offer.\n“And you would forget my tab?”\n“I’ll forget your tab\nand\nI’ll start buying alcohol.”\nThat seemed to swing the scales. Pisces nodded. He sat back ponderously in his chair and intoned in his important-sounding voice.\n“Very well then. Let us begin with the Mage’s Test. Observe.”\nPisces raised a finger, which began to glow with blue-white light. He began to trace something in the air. Where his finger moved, the light from it seemed to leave an ethereal residue. Erin squinted at it, fascinated.\n“This is the basic test for determining aptitude. I am drawing—”\nThe gentle glow of blue magic was half-complete in the air when something interrupted Pisces’ lecture. A flash of light bloomed right in front of his nose. Pisces yelped, overbalanced in his chair, and crashed to the ground.\nErin backed up. Pisces flailed around on the ground as Rags dove out of her chair and underneath a table.\n“What was that? Get it off!”\nSomething\nwas hovering in the air in front of Pisces. He batted at it frantically and then paused as he saw what it was. Slowly, he sat up, and Erin saw something floating around his head. It looked…like a firefly? A firefly made of red and gold—no, more like a spectrum of those colors flickering together and winking out in front of the [Mage]’s face. It was beautiful and mysterious.\n“What\nis\nthat?”\nPisces stood up. He slowly reached out, and the firefly became motes of light that danced around his hand. He stared at them.\n“It’s a messaging spell, but I haven’t seen one like that since—”\nHe broke off, frowning. The pinpoints of light began to coalesce into strange, flickering shapes. Erin squinted at them, but they didn’t look like letters. Or…were they words? She couldn’t describe it—no, she couldn’t even\nunderstand\nit.\nEach fleck of light twisted and became hovering runes or symbols, but they also made Erin think they were words. But could you make a single letter or shape into an entire concept? And they…they\nhurt\nto look at. Erin’s eyes ached trying to take the strange, magical shapes in.\nIt was as if they didn’t exist in normal, three-dimensional space. And the more Erin looked at them, the more she developed a painful headache and stinging behind her eyes. She had to glance away.\nRags was desperately trying to stare at the magical message, but she seemed to be in as much pain as Erin, clutching at her head and prying her eyes open with her dirty fingers.\nOnly Pisces seemed to be able to look at the shapes without any pain. He frowned and stood up. For a moment, his face was thunderous as he stared at the flickering spell, and Erin was disconcerted by the raw anger in his expression. Then it became melancholic almost as fast. He reached out as if to quash the little spell, then let it rest upon his fingertips. He murmured half to himself, then blinked and glanced at Erin.\n“\nWhy would—\nno. Wait. I must read this. I, ah, will be going now. Thank you for the meal.”\n“No—problem.”\nErin shaded her eyes and watched as the dusty robes and sandaled feet made their way to her door. They paused, and she heard Pisces’ voice again.\n“—Regardless of your feelings, you should still hire some sort of protection. The more aggressive types of monsters and wildlife will soon return to this area.”\nErin looked up and blinked as one of the shapes pulsed a message she couldn’t understand into her brain. She covered her eyes. When she dared remove her hand, Pisces was gone.",

    "text": "Bodyguards. Hired help. Bouncers. Security. People with pointy sticks. They ranged from people who were good in a brawl to retired or active adventurers willing to take easier jobs in exchange for pay.\nThey were expensive, but it beat being stabbed repeatedly or eaten by a monster. That was Pisces’ opinion. Erin heard pretty much the same thing when she saw Selys next.\nThe two young women were walking through the marketplace in Liscor, shopping. Erin was accompanying Selys, having placed her orders with Krshia already.\nIt was very strange. In some ways, Selys was just like any girl around Erin’s age. The female Drake looked at the latest fashions, checked out jewelry, bought food and supplies for the week, and chattered happily with the shopkeepers like any young woman living on her own.\nIf Erin closed her eyes, she could imagine she was back in her world. But when she looked at Selys, it was hard to ignore the scales. And the tail. And the conversation.\n“Look Erin, I know you want to stay in your inn, but it’s not\nsafe\n. At least hire one of the low-level adventurers. They’re not that strong, but I could get you a good deal. Maybe we could call it a perpetual extermination request. Then the Guild would pay some of the costs.”\nErin shook her head as they walked down the street.\n“I don’t see why I need protection, Selys. I haven’t seen any monsters lately, not even the Rock Crabs. The only things I see are those weird dino-birds in the sky and Rags and the Goblins.”\n“Those are bad enough. But you haven’t seen the really bad monsters because the Watch keeps them away! Look Erin, I don’t want to hear you’ve been eaten or munched up into little bits one day.”\n“Lovely image.”\n“Thanks. But the Watch is here for our protection. If they’re not guarding you—”\nSelys broke off, frowning. She and Erin stopped their progress down the street. There was a crowd ahead of them, mainly Drakes with a few Gnolls mixed in.\n“What’s that all about?”\nSomeone was shouting. No, some\nones\nwere shouting. Erin stood up on her tiptoes but couldn’t see past the bodies in front of her. Then all of a sudden the crowd opened up, and several Drakes thrust their way through.\n“Out of the way!”\nErin jumped aside and stared as a group of four armed Drakes pushed their way out of the crowd. These weren’t guardsmen, but they definitely weren’t civilians either.\n“Adventurers.”\nSelys whispered it to Erin as she drew her against one side of the street. Indeed, all of the pedestrians were giving the Drake adventurers a wide berth.\nThe Drakes shouted angrily back into the crowd behind them and stormed down the street. Erin watched them go. Then out of the crowd came a familiar figure.\nRelc pushed aside the crowd and emerged from the press of bodies, tail lashing angrily. He turned, reached back into the scrum, and pulled out a smaller, dazed-looking Drake guardsman.\n“Stop!”\nHe shouted at the backs of the Drake adventurers, but they ignored him. Fuming, Relc went to chase after them, but the other [Guardsman] grabbed him. Relc and the Drake began arguing furiously.\nSelys looked from Relc to the adventurers anxiously.\n“They must have gotten into a fight with the Watch. There will be trouble over this.”\nErin looked at Relc uncertainly. His tail was furiously lashing the ground as he argued with the other guardsman.\n“Is he going to arrest them?”\n“I hope not. Adventurers and the Watch don’t get along. If he does, there will be trouble. Well, there’s already going to be trouble at the Guild, but an arrest would really make things worse.”\nSelys watched anxiously as Relc seemed to get angrier and angrier, despite the other guardsman clearly trying to calm him down. He tore himself away and began marching down the street after the adventurers, who had already disappeared from view. Coincidentally, his path took him right in front of Selys and Erin.\nThe Drake froze up when he saw Erin. She hesitated, not certain what she should say, if anything. Before she could make up her mind, Relc whirled around and marched in the opposite direction, dragging the hapless Guardsman along in his wake. He didn’t look back once.\nSelys breathed out softly.\n“Well, that was lucky. It’s a good thing he decided not to do anything. I’d hate to see a fight break out in the market, especially since we’re not done shopping. Good thing seeing you calmed him down, right, Erin? Erin…?”\nShe looked over at Erin’s face. The Human was wiping at her eyes. Selys’ eyes widened, and her tail began to twitch.\n“Oh. Um. Sorry. I didn’t mean—let’s—let’s go.”\nGently, she took Erin by the arm and led her away. The crowd stared at the Human curiously, but lost interest now that the adventurers and Relc were both gone. Only a few Gnolls stared after Erin’s back but quickly looked away when a certain Gnoll shopkeeper stepped out of her shop and glared at them.",

    "text": "“Here. Have a cup of this.”\nSelys handed Erin a steaming cup of something bittersweet. Erin sipped at it gratefully and tasted what she imagined was a root-vegetable. Well, it wasn’t bad, and it was warm.\n“Sorry about that.”\n“…It’s fine. I just—I guess Relc wasn’t expecting to see me. He looked angry.”\n“Well, yes.”\nSelys bustled around her small home, fetching another cup of root-tea for herself as she made Erin at home. The room she’d brought Erin into reminded Erin of a normal apartment, except it was quite open and spacious. The chair she was sitting on was also sized differently so that the legs were higher off the ground than normal.\nAt last, the female Drake took a seat next to Erin.\n“I guess it was another incident with the adventurers. I didn’t recognize them from the Guild, so they must be from further south. And the ones we’ve been getting lately, well, they don’t like to obey the laws as much, so we’ve been getting a lot of complaints at the Adventurer’s Guild.”\n“Mm.”\nErin had almost forgotten Selys was a receptionist at the Guild.\n“They were all Drakes. Aren’t there Gnoll adventurers too?”\n“Oh, a few. But that was probably an all-Drake team. Gnolls—well, Gnolls don’t like working with other species as much. And not as many become adventurers, so we haven’t been getting as many.”\n“What about Humans? Aren’t any of them adventurers?”\n“Lots. Most, in fact. But this group is from down south. Past the Bloodfields. They must have risked the journey—it’s not too dangerous if you go wide around it—in hopes of finding worth in the north. Rare, but it happens. But they’re from the south.”\n“…Right?”\nErin frowned at Selys. Selys frowned back.\n“They’re from down south, so they’re all Drakes or Gnolls.”\n“Right, right. Because all Drakes live in the south…?”\nSelys paused.\n“…Erin. Do you not know the local geography?”\n“Um, no.”\nErin fidgeted in her seat. Selys sighed, but smiled.\n“You really need to pay more attention. Wait here for a second.”\nShe put down her cup and bustled about her home, rummaging around in drawers. Erin sipped at her tea until Selys came back with a piece of paper.\n“Do you know anything about this continent?”\n“I know we’re on a continent. How’s that?”\nSelys jabbed Erin playfully with one claw. Erin yelped and nearly knocked over her tea.\n“Sorry, sorry! I forgot how soft you Humans are! Sorry!”\n“It’s okay.”\nEmbarrassed, Selys picked up a quill and unscrewed an inkpot.\n“Here, let me show you. The name of the continent we’re living on is Issrysil, according to my people—but no one says that. Everyone calls it Izril. It looks…like this.”\nSelys drew on the piece of paper and outlined a body of land that looked vaguely like a triangle up top, but narrowed near the center and became vaguely shoe-shaped near the bottom. It was fairly ovoid in total, though, or maybe that was just the result of Selys’ drawing skills.\n“Okay, this is roughly where all you Humans live. See? The entire northern part of the continent except where the mountains start. From here…to…here.”\nErin peered at the giant squiggly oval Selys drew around the northern section of the continent. Then she added small triangles for mountains two-thirds up the map, a long line of them stretching across the continent, nearly cutting the top third off from the bottom.\n“And here’s Liscor. See, we’re the only way through the High Passes.\nTechnically\n, there’s a route through the mountain range over here…but it’s infested with monsters. And of course the coastal routes to the east and west.”\nSelys drew arrows through two sections of the mountain range and circled the small dot where Liscor was. That was roughly in the center of the map, where the continent was narrowest. Erin wasn’t good at geography—or topography—or whatever maps were, but it looked like Liscor was in a valley of some sorts.\n“See, that’s why Liscor is so important. Without us, any goods have to go by land or sea all the way around the continent or brave the High Passes. And that’s not a good idea.”\n“These High Passes aren’t safe?”\n“Not even for high-level adventurers. Nasty creatures live around there—they make the local monsters look harmless by comparison.”\n“Oh. But if all the Humans live in the north, what about the south? Are they all…Gnolls and Drakes?”\n“And Antinium, but only in the Hivelands. Right along the northwestern coast below the High Passes, see? There are other species, but there are only three—four, I guess—in Izril.”\nSelys shook her head as she began marking the bottom half of the map. She pointed out a small area in the lower half of Izril along the mountains and coastal range. A corner of the south.\n“Here are the five known Antinium colonies outside of Liscor. Past this point is their territory. The Hivelands.”\nShe shivered.\n“New. No one goes there, so we don’t know what it’s like, but I’ve heard it’s barren, and obviously, no armies or anyone else cross the border or get near the Antinium. It’s a death sentence.”\nWhy? Erin was about to point out Liscor had tons of Antinium…then she thought of the Soldiers and the Queen. And hadn’t Relc said Liscor was different? Klbkch….she swallowed a lump in her throat and changed the subject.\n“Bad news. Got it. Didn’t I hear Liscor’s got an army? Relc…Relc said that. Is there lots of war?”\nSelys rolled her eyes.\n“There’s always some fight between the Drake cities. Or with a Gnoll tribe. We’re not\nBaleros\n, but—right. You don’t know Liscor has an army. They don’t come home often. They’re mercenaries, technically. Always being hired by one of the cities or alliances that pop up. And there are a lot of them.”\nSelys began to furiously mark the lower half of the map with cities and circles.\n“Okay, it gets a bit complex, but the big groups are the Walled Cities over here, the Gnoll Tribes of the plains, and the independent ports and cities in this area. Most of the inhabitants are Drakes, it’s true, but there are other species. For instance, nearly a third of the population down there are Gnolls. We have a few hundred Humans here and there…sometimes String-People or even Centaurs, Selphids, or other folk, but they’re just individuals rather than a community. Mostly in the Walled Cities.”\nSome of the races Selys mentioned made no sense to Erin. What was a String Person? Or a Selphid? Or…\n“What about Beastkin? I keep hearing that they live around here, but I’ve never seen one. Unless they look exactly like Gnolls. Where do they live?”\n“Not really anywhere. I guess you might find more of them among the Gnoll Tribes—but they don’t belong there either. They come from another continent further to the west, Baleros, but they’re peaceful and easy to work with. We’ve got one total in all of Liscor. Hawk the Hare, our Courier.”\nThere was so much to ask about that Erin had to drop that fascinating line of questioning. She focused on species, first.\n“Uh, are there other kinds of people like you? What about Lizardfolk?”\nSelys scowled.\n“No lizards. We wouldn’t tolerate their kind in cities anyways.”\nErin stared at the map. Selys finished marking it and smiled at Erin.\n“Well, does that make sense?”\n“Yeah, I think so. You explained it all well, but the map is making my eyes hurt.”\n“Hey! What’s wrong with my map?”\nSelys glanced down at the confusing jumble of squiggly lines and dots on the piece of paper.\n“…Oh.”\nErin tried to keep a straight face, but couldn’t hold it in. She laughed, and after a moment, Selys laughed with her. That was a bit of happiness.\nWhen they were done, Selys pointed to one of the dots near Liscor.\n“Most of the new adventurers are coming from Pallass but it’s taking a while given how far they’re coming. I bet we’ll get a lot more and probably even some Human ones, but not for a few more days at least. Anyways, the reason all the adventurers are here is because of those new ruins. Didn’t you hear about them? Apparently, it’s some kind of underground complex—a huge one! They uncovered it a few days ago. Some [Shepherd] was walking with a herd and saw an opening in the hillside. It might be a\ndungeon.\n”\nErin remembered hearing about ruins, but it seemed like a distant memory.\n“Oh yeah. That’s a big deal, isn’t it?”\nSelys nodded seriously.\n“It’s huge. We’re getting a huge amount of merchants, adventurers, and business because of it. But of course that means more trouble when they get into fights with the Antinium or break the law. I hear the Watch is working overtime, and now that Klbkch is—”\nShe cut herself off and tried to backpedal.\n“Um, what I mean is that without—without enough guardsmen—”\n“I get it.”\nErin patted Selys on the shoulder.\n“So, there’s going to be a lot of adventurers? I might finally get some business in my inn.”\n“Only if you can protect it. Like I was saying, Erin—”\n“I need protection. Got it.”\nErin sighed.\n“It’s so weird. I guess I just got used to the inn and the local area, y’know? I haven’t seen any monsters, so I just can’t get worried.”\n“Well, you\nare\nin a place that used to have quite a few villages.”\nSelys conceded as she marked a few X’s around Liscor.\n“They all got abandoned or destroyed over time, especially after the Necromancer.”\n“Pisces?”\nThe Drake looked incredulous.\n“Who? No, not that Human. The\nNecromancer.\nFrom Terandria? The end of Silvaria? Az’kerash? Come on, Erin. Practically every Human north of us knows about him. He was from a while back and—well, we lost a lot of the area around Liscor. He destroyed entire Terandrian nations, but here,\nat Liscor\n, he met his end. The Antinium and Zel Shivertail brought him down, and that’s how the Free Hive was allowed into the city.”\nShe looked so proud about that, possibly because this Zel guy had Selys’ last name. The Drake went on, and her smile faded.\n“A lot of people died in his undead attacks and the Second Antinium War, hence all the abandoned places. The place you’re in is pretty safe. But if you go a few miles in any direction, you can find a lot of strange stuff.”\nErin was intrigued. She studied the second map Selys was drawing.\n“Really? I guess I’ve never…huh. You know, I’ve never really gone exploring. I mean, aside from finding the inn and a few other spots, I didn’t really go anywhere else. I started repairing the inn and…yeah, I didn’t ever really go any further.”\nSelys shook her head.\n“Good thing you didn’t. Some of those places are pretty dangerous. I mean, not now, obviously, since it’s not the right season and the Watch was keeping them clear, but I’ve heard stories.”\n“Like what?”\n“Oh, you know the adventurers. They always talk about treasure and finding magical artifacts in caves and so on. But the ones around here are always poor, so I wouldn’t pay attention if I were you. Most slither on back to the city before they get much further than your inn, anyways. They’re all low-level, which is why none of them have dared enter the ruins yet. They’re waiting for the stronger adventurers to clear the way before they flood in.”\n“So what you’re saying is that there’s a lot of unexplored land out there?”\n“If you stray from the roads, I guess. But who’d risk exploring out there?”\nSelys paused, realized what she’d said, and stared suspiciously at her friend. Erin kept a perfectly straight face.\n“\nErin…\n”\n“What?”\n“No! It’s too dangerous! Don’t be stupid!”\n“I just want to see what’s around the inn. I won’t go far. And I’ll run away if I see anything.”\n“No. I won’t let you go alone.”\n“Oh come on. I’ll be careful. I’ll only walk a few miles in every direction, okay? But I really don’t know what’s around the inn. I just want to explore a little.”\n“\nErin—\n”\n“I’ll be fine, I promise, Selys. What’s the worst that could happen?”\nKnock. Knock\n. Erin rapped her knuckles against the table.\n“You’re going to get yourself hurt! Or killed!”\n“There’s nothing out there that can hur",

    "text": "Once, she’d broken her arm. When it had happened, Ryoka hadn’t even felt the pain—it was just the shock of it that hurt. Only when she’d dragged herself from underneath the motorcycle and waited for the ambulance did she feel the pain.\nIt hurt. But oddly, the worst part hadn’t been the pain.\nNow, if her broken bones had actually pierced her skin at that time, her arm would have hurt far more than it did. But back then, Ryoka had been more overwhelmed by the dizzy nausea of it all and the feeling of\nwrongness\nin her arm. That had been the real trial as she waited for help.\nShe remembered that moment now. The memory floated up in her hazy mind like a bubble of the past. It was important to remember. She didn’t do it often enough.\nRyoka leaned on the table with the arm she’d once broken—her left. It was a pain in the ass to break your dominant hand. What was she thinking about? Oh yeah.\nMemory.\nMaybe if she’d remembered, she wouldn’t have made the same mistakes. But she repeated the same errors again and again. Pissing off everyone around her until they dragged her down into the mud. The same thing again and again. The symptom of madness—except that it wasn’t. That was one of the things idiots thought was true but was actually a lie.\nRyoka looked around. At this time of night, the common room of the inn was deserted. The innkeeper was in his bed, and the barmaids were all gone. But he’d left a candle on for her. Not that he would have done it if she’d asked, but a Minotaur’s polite request was quite another thing.\nShe rested her head against the table. She felt hot. And tired. But mainly hot, in the bad, stifling air sort of way. Not the hot that made uppity Minotaurs try to invite themselves into her room sort of way.\nIt was night. It might have been dark and stormy, but Ryoka was sitting inside the inn, so she couldn’t tell. She wasn’t doing anything right now. Just sitting and…waiting.\nWhat was she doing? Everything felt like it was slowly being consumed by pain and that sweltering heat—worse than fire because it was feverish, like swampy, marsh heat. Sickness.\nShe was sure her leg was now infected, and Ryoka didn’t want to think of how bad it might get.\nStupid. Just tell Magnolia she needed help. Do it now.\nThis was stupid.\nWhy was she not taking the easy, logical, practical way out? Trust a [Lady]’s resources to heal her. Not this gamble.\nNecromancy didn’t sound hygienic.\nBut she was doing it. Doing it because—she didn’t trust Magnolia? Because she was that committed to raising a middle finger to someone?\nYes. No.\nBecause she had principles? Because, because—\nShe hated being bullied into doing something.\nBecause she’d rather risk her leg on this wild idea than—\nIdiot. She had no one but herself to blame if this went wrong.\nMemory. Pain. Broken bones. Ryoka felt time slipping around her. First she was waiting and then—a half-Elf was talking to her.\n“Ryoka? Time to go.”\nWhy was she talking so quietly? Oh. It was night. Ryoka pushed her chair back. With Ceria’s arm around her, she stood up. She had to be helped to the door. Humiliation. Or was it practicality?\nThey helped lift her into the carriage. Another bit of shame, but there were no steps up. And they’d placed hay to cushion her leg. The other adventurers nodded to each other as Ryoka lay against a pillow of straw.\nCredit where credit was due. For all the Horns of Hammerad bickered and their leader was a perverted cow-man, they moved fast. Within the hour of Ceria receiving her reply from the mysterious necromancer she knew, they’d hired a carriage and horses and plotted a route to their destination.\nIt was a city far to the south by the name of Liscor. Ryoka didn’t know anything about it. Apparently, there weren’t any Humans there, just Drakes and Gnolls, whatever they were. She’d let them do it. In fact, Ryoka’s only actions since Magnolia had left were to agree to Ceria’s idea and then to sleep.\nNo—not sleep. Even as the carriage started with a jolt that banged Ryoka’s leg, she knew it hadn’t been sleep. The painful haze of dozing and waking couldn’t be called that. But now she was tired, mortally so.\nThe thing about broken bones? Ryoka blinked as the carriage rumbled down the cobblestone street. She was trying to remember. What was it? Back then, it hadn’t been the pain that was uncomfortable.\nYes, it was the other things. The pressure, the wrongness, the dizziness and nausea. All the things she felt now. Her leg felt hot underneath its wrappings. Ryoka’s mind was clouded. But the pain was gone.\nRyoka stared at the soaked bandages she could barely make out in the moonlit night. If she took the bandages off, she wouldn’t be able to think or move. Then the real pain would come back, and her leg would dangle like a dead fish. She was still tempted, though. Just to do it to see her leg bend obscenely as it flapped about on her dead skin. Flop goes the piece of flesh and shattered bone. Flop, flop. Floppy the Leg-fish.\nShe was aware that she wasn’t…wasn’t thinking too straight. Sleep deprivation from the pain just made everything harder. But now the pain was gone. Gone, and far away.\nMagic.\nShe could hear the other adventurers talking around her. Four of the Horns of Hammerad sat in the cart—or was it a wagon? It was big enough for five with room left over, so a wagon, then.\n“Is she okay?”\nThat was Gerry—Gerial. The vice-captain. He liked her, she could tell. Ryoka didn’t like him back.\nCeria glanced at Ryoka. The mage was sitting next to her in the wagon. Her eyes glowed in the light shining from the tip of the mage’s staff.\n“She should be fine. I think.”\n“She seems—odd. What spell did you cast?”\nCalruz. Ryoka didn’t like him either. Not like that.\n“It wasn’t me. Peminac cast [Numb], I think. It takes away pain, but it makes the affected slightly…odd. She should be fine, and it’s better than her feeling the pain. We just need to make sure to keep healing the leg every few hours.”\n“You still haven’t told us how your mysterious [Necromancer] friend will help heal the leg, Ceria.”\nOne of the adventurers whose name Ryoka didn’t remember turned in the wagon. He wasn’t one of the mages. He gripped the mace at his side.\n“You mean\nthe\nNecromancer? I thought we were just visiting another [Mage]! I thought he was\ndead!\n”\nThe armored warrior looked horrified. He shook his head vigorously.\n“If that’s the case, count me out. I’m sorry, but not even a debt of honor would make me face that monster.”\nCalruz rumbled. He was striding along next to the wagon. Even as they picked up speed as they left the city gates and rumbled down the road he didn’t seem to notice the quick pace.\n“In that case, get out. And consider yourself banned from the Horns of Hammerad while you’re at it.”\n“Calruz—”\nGerial intervened. He patted the warrior on the shoulder.\n“It’s not the Necromancer we’re going to meet. Just an ordinary [Necromancer], so don’t worry. Az’kerash is dead. Everyone knows that.”\nThe name alone was enough to scare some of the others, though. Calruz had no sympathy for it.\n“We don’t need cowards! Jump off and run back into the city!”\n“Running from the Necromancer isn’t cowardice, idiot. Calm down. Hunt, get back here.”\nCeria called down from the wagon as she stabbed her staff at the Minotaur’s head for emphasis. He grunted, and Ceria added.\n“You weren’t on the continent when the Necromancer attacked with his legions ten years back.\nOr\na Terandrian. Hunt is. I grew up with stories of him attacking kingdoms and killing people by the thousand. And that was when\nI\nwas a girl. Believe me—even if we were all\nthirty\nlevels higher, we’d still be no match for him. So stop questioning the courage of your own party!”\nCalruz glared, but he eventually relented. Ryoka could hear him rumbling what sounded like insults as he kept pace with the horses.\nHer eyes were closed because that made the world spin less. But Ryoka had to ask.\n“So this Necromancer is still alive?”\nA pause. Did they think she’d been asleep? But then Gerial replied.\n“In the past, they never found his body and he’d pop up. But the Tidebreaker, Zel Shivertail, beheaded him and they burned him. Still, some people remember him, and everyone hates [Necromancers]. They’re not outlawed everywhere—but close enough.”\nWhich made it odder that Ceria knew one, and the rest of her team was giving her the side-eye. She cleared her throat.\n“In any case, the [Mage] we’re going to visit is not the Necromancer. He just…practices necromancy. And he’s the only person who can help Ryoka I could think of.”\n“Ah.”\nSomeone shifted on the wagon. Ryoka heard the scraping of metal on wood. She peeked open an eye and saw the half-Elf looking at the other female mage on the wagon.\n“I still don’t like it. Ceria, how do you\nknow\nsomeone like that?”\nShe shrugged.\n“We studied together in Wistram Academy. I was a friend of his…once. We parted ways badly several years ago, but I knew he was probably in the area. Besides, Pisces isn’t very dangerous. Annoying, yes, but not dangerous. He’s…thoughtless, secretive, selfish, and he’s made terrible mistakes. But he’s no monster. And I hate to admit it but—he is very smart.”\nGerial leaned forwards.\n“You told him what you want him to do?”\nThe half-Elf blew out her cheeks.\n“I gave him the barest details. The messaging spell I used didn’t give me time for more, but he agreed. We’re not on good terms, like I said. He’ll meet us at an inn a few miles east of Liscor. Don’t worry; he’s competent. But I suspect he’ll want money, and lots of it.”\n“We can cover the cost.”\nCalruz interjected before Ryoka could speak. Which was good, because she was completely broke at the moment. Even the healing potions and carriage had been paid for by the Horns of Hammerad.\n“Why’s he out there?”\n“He’s in hiding.”\n“Why does he practice necromancy?”\nA pause. Ryoka’s eyelids felt heavy. Then Ceria spoke.\n“I suspect because he likes dead people more than he likes the living most of the time.”\n“I get that.”\nEveryone turned to Ryoka, but the young woman was half-asleep already. Ryoka let her head fall back against the bouncing carriage. She meant to ask more questions, but she was so\nhot\n. And tired. The parts of her shattered leg that she could feel felt like they were throbbing. But the pain was gone, thanks to the magic.\nIn this moment, that was enough to make the bumping, rattling wagon smelling of hay into heaven. Ryoka sank back into the hay.\nShe closed her eyes and slept.",

    "text": "Riding on a carriage pulled by a horse is\nnot\nfun with a shattered leg. Even with healing potions and anti-pain spells. But compared to sleeping in an inn sans anti-pain spells and with limited healing potions, it’s bliss.\nI slept for two days, apparently. Well, I woke up and ate and talked, but they told me I had a fever. By the time it broke and I started to remember things, two days had passed. It’s midday, and apparently, we’re two-thirds of the way towards our destination*.\n*Which, considering how far Liscor is away from the Human lands, is pretty damn impressive. The Horns of Hammerad must have set a blistering pace to get this far so quickly.\nSome [Driver] is rolling the wagon forwards and grumbling nonstop about his ponies, but he’s fast. Skills, apparently, let him carry us faster than most vehicles or even horses—if not cars.\nI missed the details of what happened while I slept. But apparently, the Horns of Hammerad made a few stops at another city. Firstly, to let the rest of their injured party members know what they were doing, and secondly, to swap out horses. Then they continued their journey into the night, half of them sleeping in the wagon and then swapping out with the others in the morning.\nThey even took care of my leg. The bandages weren’t changed, of course, but they’d used another healing potion so my leg didn’t look as puffy and horribly red. Just…puffy and red at the moment.\n“How are you feeling?”\nCeria leans forward over the hay when she notices I’m awake. She hands me a roll of sweet, crumbling bread spread with jam and butter. It tastes delicious.\n“Good. Thanks for everything.”\nMy voice wakes up one of the guys sleeping in the wagon. Gerial blinks up at me and gives me a charming smile. I guess it’s charming. Someone else would probably think it was, at any rate.\n“We’re happy to repay our debts, Ryoka. And it hasn’t been that much of a chore so far.”\nSays the guy sleeping in hay on a bumpity wagon after two days of roughing it. Well, maybe that\nis\nnormal by this world’s standards.\n“I’ll remember this.”\nCrap. That sounded like a threat. And…now he’s looking confused. Great. Change the subject, fast.\n“—So. About this mage.”\nCeria nods. She fiddles with her staff. It’s not glowing anymore. I guess it takes mana to keep it lit*.\n*Mana. Magical energy. This world already sounds like a classic videogame, and they use terms right out of most games I know. Still, the idea that we all have our own internal reservoir of magic is cool.\n“Pisces. I told you that he’s a [Necromancer]. In truth, he’s probably not that strong of one—I remember that he was about Level 22 when we were students together in Wistram Academy. Even if he’s leveled up a bit, he shouldn’t be a threat if you’re worried.”\nI hear a snort. Huh. Calruz is\nstill\nkeeping pace with the wagon. Did he…run throughout the night? Even\nI’m\nnot that kind of crazy.\n“I fear no [Mage], especially not a weak one who practices cowardly magic like necromancy.”\nGerial shook his head.\n“He’s still the same level as most of our group. That’s not bad. But why did you say he was hiding out, Ceria?”\nShe scratches her head and glances over the side of the wagon. Not directly away from Gerial, but I know evasion when I see it.\n“…He was kicked out of Wistram Academy. And he’s wanted by several cities for causing trouble, I gather. Not murder—just extortion and troublemaking.”\nTime for more information gathering.\n“Let me guess. He was kicked out because they found he was practicing necromancy, right?\nCeria hesitates, and her eyes cloud over. Her team’s listening, but the half-Elf just murmurs vaguely.\n“Oh, no. It wasn’t just that. No, it was because of what he\ndid\nwith necromancy that he was expelled.”\nAgain, the awkward silence. I hate this kind of conversation, but someone’s got to ask the obvious question. Thankfully, it’s Gerial not me that gets to ask.\n“What did he do?”\nCeria tightens her lips.\n“…He got a lot of people killed. By accident. I think it was an accident, but a good friend of mine died. That wasn’t the only…only reason. But it’s past now. Six years past. I called in what few favors I think I had left to get him to meet us.”\nThe rest of the Horns glance at each other. I lick my lips and accept a flask of water. Some kind of past drama? Curious. I guess. I’m not too interested in this mystery [Necromancer]’s past right now, except whether or not he’s competent.\n“Is he competent?”\nCeria nods, relieved to be changing the subject—I could see Calruz opening his mouth.\n“Oh yes. He’s got the levels to do what we need, and he’s smart. You could even call him a genius in a limited sense.”\n“How so?”\nCeria scowls and adjusts the blankets she’s wrapped around herself.\n“Well, he’s only a brat—I mean, he’s only around twenty in your years, which I suppose makes him an adult. But he’s got levels in multiple magical classes. If you add them all up, he’s got more than I do, and I’m\nthree times\nhis age.”\nDon’t they say never mention a woman’s age in public? But I guess half-Elves don’t care about that sort of thing.\n“So this operation. What—”\nI stop and cover a yawn. Really? I\njust slept\n.\n“What—”\nI’m\nstill yawning?\nWhat’s wrong with me?\n“Tired?”\nI want to smack the grin right off of Gerial’s face.\n“…Guess I’m tired.”\nCeria nods.\n“The [Numb] spell and all the healing you’re doing is probably taking its toll. If you need to sleep—sleep. We won’t get to Liscor for several more hours, and we still need to water and feed the ponies.”\n“Worthless nags.”\n“\nI heard that, sir!\n”\nThe [Driver] turns in his seat, and I see an old man—and the ponies—glare at the Minotaur. Which is funny. He snaps back.\n“If you want to go faster, get off and pull yourself. Or I’ll thank you to not insult my ponies.”\n“Calruz, shut up. This is the only [Driver] we could get who can take us there fast.”\n“Yeah, shut up, with respect, Captain.”\nGerial and Ceria berate Calruz, and I hear him rumble an apology at the touchy [Driver]. It’s a shame. I like anyone who has an attitude like that…so long as it’s not directed at me…\nSomething about hypocrisy?\n…Crap. I’m already slipping back into sleep. Why? I guess…just that tired?\nI hear the last fragment of a reply as I drift off.\n“—I personally believe he’s delusional and that he’ll never achieve his goals. But regardless, he won’t stay in the area long. Every time the Academy learns where he’s staying, they send out a team to capture him. So far, he’s escaped, but it’s only a matter of time before he stays in one place too long and gets caught.”\nAnd then—and then—\nI go back to sleep.",

    "text": "When Ryoka woke up the second time, she looked around and knew that she was in a different place. The grasslands still stretched around her, but the grass was longer here, and to each side, she saw towering mountains enclosing the area.\nShe was in a valley. A pass between the mountain ranges that she normally saw as distant shapes in the distance. And the dirt road the wagon had been travelling on was now stone. The increased rumbling and jolting as the wagon struck uneven stones was probably what woke her up. Also, something really\nstank,\nand it was hard to sleep through.\n“Evening.”\nThis time, Ceria handed Ryoka a piece of bread with some sliced cheese and meat. Again, Ryoka devoured the meal quickly before she spoke.\n“How was the trip?”\nOne of the other mages enjoying his lunch looked up and replied.\n“Uneventful. We scared away a few Razorbeaks that wanted to take a bite out of your leg, but we haven’t seen any other monsters.”\nRyoka blinked stupidly. Her head still felt stuffed.\n“Razorbeaks?”\n“Large, green birds. Leathery. Got teeth sharp as a knife, but they’re not too dangerous. A few sparks scare them away.”\n“Not a challenge.”\nRyoka looked over and realized what the smell was. Calruz sat at the far end of the wagon—\ndownwind\nof the other adventurers. He was sweating heavily. To put it politely, he\nreeked\n. The smell reminded Ryoka of a workout gym right in the middle of rush hour crossed with a barn right in the middle of a different kind of rush hour.\n“We near Liscor?”\n“A few miles away. But we should see the inn Pisces mentioned any minute now. You have good timing.”\nRyoka shrugged. She kept looking around. The plains really were quite empty. She supposed sleeping through most of the journey had a lot to do with that, but really, the landscape she could see had very few variations in it. Just a few trees over…there and some weird rocks scattered all over in other directions. And over there—\n“Goblins.”\nRyoka said it at the same time as Ceria. The other adventurers sat up and squinted to see as they reached for their weapons. Calruz took one look and sat back against the wagon.\n“Bah.”\nGerial squinted as the warrior by his side pulled out a longbow from the supplies in the carriage and began to string it.\n“Goblins. Looks like a fight within their own tribe.”\nRyoka could see two groups of Goblins slashing and clubbing each other in the distance. It was hard to tell, but it looked like one side was being led by a small Goblin while the other was leaderless. Still, the numbers favored the leaderless side.\n“Hm. Looks like one of those Goblins has some experience fighting. See—they’re using formations and fighting together.”\nCalruz didn’t even look up as he stretched out.\n“Rabble. Not worth dirtying a blade over. Not a single Hob in sight.”\nOne of the other adventurers gritted their teeth.\n“You wouldn’t say that if you ever saw a raiding party—or a warband. Besides, the Guild offers a copper piece for every four pairs of Goblin ears.”\nThe bow-wielding warrior drew an arrow and sighted down the shaft.\n“I can probably hit the runt if you slow the carriage down. Might stop a new chieftain being selected for a few more days. Want me to make the shot?”\nCalruz waved a hand indifferently, clearly uncaring. The warrior glanced at Gerial. And Gerial glanced at Ryoka. He hesitated and then shook his head.\n“This isn’t our area, and besides, it’s a tiny tribe. Let the local adventurers deal with it if it becomes an issue. Let’s go find that [Necromancer].”\n“He should be waiting at the inn. Anyone see it?”\nThe other adventurers looked around as the warrior unstrung his bow, grumbling about a missed opportunity. Ryoka looked around too, but the landscape was full of hidden hills and dips that made seeing in a straight line hard.\nIt was half an hour before one of the mages pointed.\n“There’s the inn. We’re here.”\nRyoka’s head shot up. She saw in the distance a rising hill, broad enough to almost be called a plateau, and on it—\nAn inn.\nIt was quite ordinary. Ryoka glanced at its weathered façade and immediately paid no attention more to it. Because standing on top of the gently sloping hill and staring down towards the party of adventurers was a [Mage].\nHe was clearly a [Mage]. He looked pasty-skinned and like he was more used to wielding books than a sword. His robes were white—well, as the wagon approached, they became more colorful, but he was wearing robes.\nThe wagon rumbled to a stop as the sweating horses finally finished their long journey. The adventurers slowly and silently slid out of the wagon. Ryoka tried to get up, but Calruz simply picked her up in his arms and hopped off the wagon before placing her on her feet. She glared at him but then focused on the [Mage].\nPisces. He looked quite harmless as the Horns of Hammerad spread out in front of him. But Ryoka noticed that while none of the adventurers had drawn their swords, they weren’t relaxing in front of him. And they were in formation—two of the [Mages] in the back while the warrior with the mace stood in front of them. Calruz and Gerial flanked Ceria as she stepped forwards.\nThe half-Elf walked forwards until she and Pisces were a few feet apart. They appraised each other. One, a part-immortal with beauty that bordered on the supernatural, wearing robes woven with magic and finest cloth. The other, a [Mage] in dirty robes standing in front of a run-down inn.\nCeria inclined her head slightly. Pisces nodded.\n“Pisces.”\n“Ceria.”\n“It’s been a while, hasn’t it?”\n“Quite. Spoken to Mons? Beatrice, perchance?”\nHe gave her a wary look, and Ceria’s wary look turned into a flash of anger.\n“You know I haven’t. This isn’t a trap. I haven’t heard a word for—”\nHe raised his palms.\n“I am simply asking.”\n“Well—no. This is a mission of mercy. Thanks—thanks for meeting us.”\nHis face twisted into a sneer, and he seemed about to say something, but then he glanced at Ceria’s team and at Ryoka. Both fell silent as Ryoka balanced on one leg. She looked from one face to the other. Clearly, there was little love lost between the two, but they weren’t enemies. It was another one of the awkward social moments she hated.\nCeria broke the silence. She nodded towards the inn.\n“Is there anyone in there? Can we buy supplies and rest or do we have to go into the city?”\nHe shrugged.\n“Not at the moment. The owner is currently elsewhere, it seems.”\n“They let you stay at the inn? Nevermind, it doesn’t matter. Well then, I guess this is as good a place as any.”\n“I suppose so.”\nMore silence. Ceria tightened her grip on her staff.\n“You know what we want you to do?”\n“Mend shattered bone? A simple task.”\nPisces shrugged casually. This seemed to infuriate Gerial. The vice-captain stepped forwards.\n“We’ve travelled over a hundred miles to get here, mage. You’re supposed to be a [Necromancer] able to help us, but I haven’t heard how you’d be able to mend bone. [Necromancers] deal with the dead, so what makes you special? No [Healer] from Wales to Celum could help Ryoka!”\nIf looks could kill—Pisces’ icy stare would merely have wounded. He took his time replying and sniffed hard as he looked down his nose at Gerial.\n“Necromancy is a misnomer for the true nature of my magic. Reanimation is but one component of raising the dead. Another, crucial aspect is the manipulation and fundamental understanding of—”\nCeria interrupted.\n“Bones. He can control bones.”\nPisces sniffed.\n“Thank you for the simplistic explanation. I suppose that does explain it, however. In any event, know that I am a [Necromancer] capable of your request. Kindly refrain from addressing me with pointless questions ever again. As for [Healers] being insufficient—it is not\nmy\nfault that there’s so little talent to go around.”\nHe turned to Ceria, completely ignoring the outraged Gerial.\n“And my fee? As requested?”\nCeria made a face.\n“We’ll give you twenty gold coins. No more, no less.”\nHer team muttered at the price. It must have been high—even for the [Healer] to do what they had to Ryoka’s leg, she’d paid less than five gold coins total, not including the valuable bandages and potions. But the Runner just let Ceria negotiate.\nPisces raised an eyebrow.\n“For what you want? When, as your dear\nteammate\npoints out, no [Healer] can help your patient? Sixty, no less.”\n“Thirty. And even that is robbery. This is a Silver-rank team, Pisces. Not some Gold-rank.”\n“Nevertheless. You can eminently afford…fifty.”\n“Forty.”\n“—Fine.”\nPisces nodded, looking a bit too eager. Ceria looked over at Calruz, who tilted his head imperceptibly.\n“We’ve got a deal then.”\n“Very well. And the injured party I’m to heal?”\nThis time, all the Horns glared at him. Ceria pointed at Ryoka’s bad leg. Pisces glanced over and sniffed.\n“Of course.”\nCeria let out a sigh that spoke to Ryoka of long suffering. She gestured at the inn and grasslands.\n“Where do you want to work?”\n“There’s no need to move. Now that we’ve agreed, let’s begin.”\nPisces reached down and put a hand on Ryoka’s leg. She felt something begin to\nshift\ninside her leg and bit back a shout of surprise.\n“\nPisces!\n”\nCeria shouted, and the other Horns reached for their weapons. Calruz clenched his fist and loomed forwards ominously, but Pisces didn’t look around.\nHe was shifting his finger as he stared hard at Ryoka’s leg. Something was moving around in there. Ryoka could feel multiple points of contact as the skin on her leg rippled and\ntwisted\n.\nIt didn’t hurt. But it felt more unpleasant than anything she’d ever experienced. For once, her body was\nnot\nin her control, and Ryoka didn’t like it one bit.\nBut almost as soon as it had started, the feeling stopped. Pisces glanced up from her leg and narrowed his eyes at Ceria.\n“I would appreciate no shouting during the process. You know how much concentration this takes even without interruption.”\nThe half-Elf stepped forwards and jabbed Pisces hard in the chest, making him wince.\n“You idiot! At least have her lie down before you do that!”\nPisces shrugged insolently.\n“The comfort of the patient is of no object to me. Regardless…I’m done. Where’s my payment?”\nThe other adventurers stared at him incredulously.\n“Already?”\n“Impossible!”\nGerial strode forwards and jabbed at Pisces angrily.\n“You can’t have finished so quickly! You must be lying!”\nPisces stepped back rather than let Gerial get near him. He sneered at the older man.\n“You may doubt all you wish, but I believe my fellow student can attest to my competence. Besides which, any spell would confirm the veracity of my statement. Tell them, Springwalker.”\nCeria nodded reluctantly. She bent down and felt at Ryoka’s leg, then shot a glance up. But she traced a long, continuous line down Ryoka’s leg and then stood up and whistled.\n“It’s true. He’s restored the bone to normal. Dead gods—that’s incredible.”\nThe Horns of Hammerad exclaimed in surprise and shock. They immediately appraised Pisces again, all except for Ryoka. She was still staring down at her leg.\n“Fine, then. Your money.”\nCeria looked at Calruz. The Minotaur grunted and fished in his belt pouch. He tossed Ceria a small sack of coins. She caught it and upended it over her palm. Gold coins poured out—far more than the bag should have contained.\nPisces waited until Ceria had counted the coins out. There were more than could fit in her hand, but as the coins poured out, Ceria’s hand shimmered with faint green light, and they began to float in the air.\nThe gold coins flew upwards and then resolved themselves into four perfect stacks of ten standing straight up in the half-Elf’s hand. She handed them to Pisces with a face as if she were plucking a tooth. He smiled as he poured the gold into a pouch at his side. Ceria whirled away, and the Horns of Hammerad retreated to confer around Ryoka’s leg.\n“I have plans for this gold. Not least, it will help shut up a certain annoying [Innkeeper]—”\nHe stopped when he realized no one was listening to him. Pisces glared around, turned, and walked away.",

    "text": "“Sorry about that.”\nCeria apologized once Pisces had moved out of earshot. She sighed and rubbed at her brow.\n“I’d forgotten how annoying Pisces gets, and I remembered quite a bit.”\nGerial was close to tearing out his hair. He snapped at Ceria while glaring at Pisces’ back.\n“If it was that simple, why couldn’t you have done that? The entire spell barely took\nseconds!\n”\n“Exactly.”\nCalruz grunted. A large vein was throbbing in his head as he clenched his fists.\n“That little runt of a Human was mocking us the entire time. We travelled all this way and paid all this coin for a spell that any one of you could have done? Explain yourself, Ceria!”\nBoth Captain and vice-captain of the Horns of Hammerad glared at their mage, but she was at least equal to them in projecting ire.\n“\nI\ncouldn’t have done that. And that was no spell—at least, not any spell written down. You think we overpaid? I think we\nunderpaid,\nand I’m just glad Pisces didn’t catch on to what Gerial was saying.”\nCalruz paused. His massive face wrinkled up.\n“What do you mean?”\n“Pisces was moving around each of the shattered bones and knitting them together. He could sense where they are, and he knows how to reassemble them. That isn’t something any normal [Mage] could do. Or even a regular [Necromancer].”\nThe other mage shivered.\n“Ceria is right, Calruz. I wouldn’t know where to begin with an injury like that. But the speed and precision of that [Necromancer]…and you say he’s\nonly\nLevel 22?”\nCeria twirled her staff in her hands as she took her time responding.\n“Pisces is a genius. He possesses an intimate knowledge of Human bodies. No one but another [Necromancer] could have done that so easily. And frankly, I would not trust any other [Necromancer] but Pisces. Listen, have you\never\nheard of someone mending shattered bone like that?”\nThe other adventurers fell silent. Calruz glanced at Gerial, and the vice-captain hesitated.\n“You hear about the Healer of Tenbault, and Named-ranks have the highest-grade potions in the world. But…no. I know a lot of Silver and Bronze-ranks who take a bad break and it never heals.”\nCalruz looked horrified—and angry. But his eyes were flickering.\n“The House of Minos has a lot of experience with bone injuries, and our [Healers] are the best as I said. But—that was instantaneous. And the solution is a [Necromancer]? I should report this to home. If that really does mend bone that fast…”\n“And it worked? This only matters if it works.”\nHunt interrupted nervously. The man was glancing at Ryoka for confirmation. Now, the adventurers stared at Ryoka’s leg. It seemed…unchanged, at least under the bandages. That was to say, the bandages were so red and dirty that none of the actual flesh could be spotted underneath. At least the leg didn’t appear swollen.\n“The flesh is still probably broken, but the bone underneath should be repaired if Pisces is right. He doesn’t know healing spells, but he could easily reinforce and repair the bone.”\nCeria peered at Ryoka. The girl hadn’t moved the entire time—since Pisces had begun changing her leg, she’d been frozen, staring down at it.\n“Ryoka? How do you feel?”\nNo response. It was as if Ryoka were lost to the world. Ceria frowned, worry crossing her expression.\n“…Ryoka?”",

    "text": "“…Ryoka?”\nSomeone is calling my name. And I want to answer them, I really do. But something else is occupying my mind. If you put the second coming, Armageddon, an alien invasion, and Elvis Presley rising from the dead right in front of my face, I wouldn’t be able to look up.\nBecause I can feel it.\nThe magic on my leg is still there, but I can feel it. The flesh may be broken, but the bone is whole. My bones are whole.\nI. Am. Whole.\n“Ryoka? Are you okay? How do you feel?”\nWhat kind of question is that? How do I feel? Am I okay? How could—how could\nwords\n, mere words describe what I’m feeling at the moment.\nIt took just a moment, but the difference between the me of now and then is—is the difference of a lifetime. I am healed. I am\nme\nagain.\n“Ryoka?”\nCeria puts a hand on my shoulder. It brings me out of the moment, just for a second. And it’s annoying because this is a moment I wish could last forever. If I could capture this feeling—if I could remember it, I would never despair again. This is what it means to have hope fulfilled.\nBut she wants an answer. How do I feel? Am I okay? What a stupid question. But I have to respond with something. Something…something pithy, like ‘how do you think?’\nI open my mouth, and\nsomething\nchanges.\n…What?\nFor once, there’s nothing angry in me, no heart full of rage and hurt. Instead—instead, as I open my mouth, I hesitate. The bitter, harsh words stop on my tongue and refuse to come out. And something inside of me asks: why? Why and when?\nWhy was I about to lash out at the person who saved me? Saved. Me. Why would I ever do such a thing, repay all her kindness with rudeness? Am I that kind of person?\nWhen did I forget gratitude? Since when was my first response always anger? When did I forget what it meant to say ‘thank you?’\nWho am I, and where did the girl who smiled go?\nI don’t say anything. I swallow the bitter words unspoken. Instead, I turn to Ceria and look her in the eye. Her eyes are gold, the molten core of suns and burnished gold. The color of wheat fields in the fading sun, and caught in their depths is a glimpse of something deeper, something greater. A bit of eternity.\nI bow my head, low. It’s been too long since I looked at my own two feet. I can feel the surprise of the people around them, but it’s only natural. It’s the least I can do. Should do.\n“Thank you.”\nAgain, surprise. But I keep my head bowed. I can’t look them in the eyes just yet. The ground is blurry. So I repeat the same words.\n“Thank you. Thank you, thank you.\nThank you.\n”\nInsufficient words. They’re not enough. How could words ever be enough?\nThe Japanese—the people that make up half of my heritage—they have a type of bow they use for apologies. It looks like prostration, and that’s what it translates to in English.\n土下座. Dogeza. I once swore that I’d never do that for anyone. Not kings or queens or even God if he existed. But I’d do it now if I knew it wouldn’t make them feel so awkward. But I do it now, in my mind and soul. Thanking the people who gave me back what matters most to me.\nMy legs. My wings. My ability to fly. So I thank them in every way I can.\n“It was nothing—”\nI look up. Ceria is blushing. And on her face, it is truly cute rather than beautiful to see. I smile and turn. Calruz blinks down at me. Surprised? But I think I know how to thank him, and it is differently than Ceria.\n“I am truly grateful. And I’m sorry for my rudeness earlier. I owe you a debt I can’t repay. But I know the Horns of Hammerad now, and I know what defines you.”\nI stick out my hand towards him.\n“Honor.”\nCalruz pauses again. But then he seizes my hand and grips it tight. His eyes were deep and blue—I hadn’t guessed. We shake hands.\n“Honor and duty above all. Without it, we are animals.”\nI turn to Ceria and shake her hand next. And then Gerial’s. And the rest of the adventurers. How long? How long since I properly shook hands and acted like a decent person?\nFirm grip, look them in the eye. Just like dad taught me. And they smile in return. They smile, and I feel it again.\nTrust.\n“My name is Ryoka Griffin. I am in your debt. Whatever I can do—if ever you need me, just ask.”\nI stand straight and tall. Whole once more. And my mind continues where my voice stops.\nRyoka Griffin. Freshman in Columbia University, or—I would have been. I never got to set foot on campus. Accepted with a Track and Field scholarship, specializing in the 400-meter run. 3.89 GPA average, hobbies include hunting, sports shooting, and reading. Not decided on any particular major. A fan of Youtube videos and playing video games, but didn’t put that on the college application.\nRyoka Griffin, runner, unfriendly daughter who doesn’t like her dad, 4th Dan in Muay Thai although I like Parkour a lot more. Refused Mensa membership, kicked out of two high schools. Angry girl. Lost soul.\nLoves songs she can run to, a huge fan of rock and an enemy of pop, techno, and opera. Favorite artists include Meatloaf, Imagine Dragons, Fun, Lady Gaga*, and…Five for Fighting.\n*Not all pop songs are bad, okay?\nCurrently—\nGrateful.\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "When they removed the bandage from Ryoka’s leg, the other adventurers flinched back. All except for Ceria and Calruz, that was.\nRyoka stared down into the bloody, ripped mess of skin and once again was profoundly grateful for the numbing magic they’d put on her leg. Gerial looked pale as he gathered up the bandages. They were soaked with blood and grime, but they were still valuable.\n“The flesh—”\n“It’s fine.”\nCeria reassured the others. She fished out a red potion and uncorked the bottle.\n“That’s what happens when you move bone around. But now the leg can be healed properly since the bone is repaired. Let’s heal—”\n“\nHold it.\n”\nCalruz caught her arm, and for a second, Ryoka wondered if this was revenge for getting punched. She wasn’t in\ntoo\nmuch pain compared to before.\nShe could actually tell her bone was intact, not, you know,\nshredding her flesh with every passing moment.\nBut the distinction was crippling delirium compared to an open, shredded leg—\n“Give me the potion. What’s the hold up? Come on—”\nRyoka hissed through gritted teeth, but Calruz was eying the bloody, messy wound. Surprisingly, not much pus or other nasty fluids; the [Healer] had cleaned it and put on what they claimed would stop an infection.\n“We must clean the wound first. A healing potion can accelerate an infection—”\n“Dead gods, he’s right.”\nCeria lowered her arm and cursed, and Gerial bit his lip.\n“That would not be…a good outcome.”\nRyoka looked from face to face.\n“Infection? What? Healing potions accelerate infections?”\n“That’s one of the reasons why adventurers can’t heal everything. That and poison stops healing from working properly. Hey, Pisces—\nPisces!\n”\nThe [Necromancer] turned from counting his gold coins a ways off.\n“What?”\n“Does this building have anyone in it? Can we get some hot water? Or just water? We could boil our canteen water I guess.”\n“We have cooking supplies. Calruz has them in his bag of holding.”\n“I could inquire within, but the owner is out.”\n“Who runs an inn with just one person? Nevermind. Uh—thanks.”\nThe half-Elf was awkward with the [Necromancer]. He sniffed and glanced at Ryoka archly. Ceria’s past with him, whatever it was, made the two stiff and grudgingly respectful. At best.\n“The Minotaur is correct, Springwalker. Clean the wound. Too bad you never took that alchemy class, eh?”\nHe smiled—and Ceria’s face froze up. Her eyes flashed.\n“Go to Rhir, Pisces.”\nHis smile disappeared instantly. Ryoka\nthought\nhe’d meant it as a joke or…whatever the case, the [Necromancer] reddened and stepped back. He whirled away as the Horns fell silent—then stopped.\n“\nVinegar.\nOr soap. Hot soap and water.”\n“What?”\nCalruz looked up, and Ryoka, biting her lip hard, glanced up. Pisces sneered at them.\n“Wash the wound. I know soap is not what you put on a wound—it doesn’t matter if you’ll heal it. Wash any grit straight out. Do hurry, though. The longer the wound is exposed, the sooner it will fester.”\nHe was right. Ryoka’s own germ knowledge made her clench her teeth—and the Minotaur already had a kettle going over a magical flame that the [Mage] Sostrom was producing with his staff.\n“We’ll have to dump it over the wound. Ryoka Griffin, do you need something to clench with your teeth?”\n“Do it. I’ll be fine. This—this is payback, isn’t it?”\n“I assure you, it’s merely practicality.”\nThey had the kettle boiling quickly with the magical fire. Gerial gave Ryoka an arm to grip, but she clenched one hand.\n“I’ll be fine. Just pour it on—fast.”\n“Don’t burn her leg off. Just get that slime—grab my arm, Ryoka.”\nGeria was remonstrating with Calruz. The Runner refused to.\n“I’m\nfine.\n”\n“Sure?”\n“Yes—\nargh! Fuck you! I’ll kill you! You motherf—\n”\nRyoka’s screaming made Pisces glance back, even as he walked off across the Floodplains hills. Ryoka doubled over as the adventurers held her still, and Calruz spoke.\n“Ceria—now.”\nCarefully, the half-Elf poured the healing potion over Ryoka’s leg. It was a stronger, more expensive potion, so the effects began instantly once the liquid hit her flesh.\nThe scalding\nagony\nfaded, and Ryoka let go of Gerial’s shoulder. She watched with nauseous interest as the flesh and sinew began to re-knit, shifting around like a bunch of worms. At this point, most of the Horns of Hammerad had to look away, but she kept watching. It was her body after all.\nAfter about a minute, the top layer of skin began to close. Ryoka saw her flesh flow together to become smooth and whole. It was the most satisfying sight she’d ever seen.\nCeria tapped the bottle for the last drops of healing potion to fall out and then tucked it away in her belt.\n“Looks good. I’m going to dispel the magic now. Ryoka, how does it feel?”\nRyoka shrugged. She was red-faced, mostly because of her reaction. She glanced at Gerial.\n“S-sorry.”\n“No problem.”\nHe winced; she must have really grabbed his shoulder. Ryoka turned back to Ceria.\n“I can’t feel anything. But it looks good. Go ahead.”\nCeria nodded and grabbed the wand at her belt. She murmured a few words, and Ryoka listened for magical tongues, some deep magic—but all she heard was a disappointing normal voice.\n“[Dispel Magic]. Alright, I’m ready to put the spell back. Ryoka? How’s it feel?”\nAll of the adventurers crowded close, alternating between staring at Ryoka’s face and her leg.\nFor a few seconds, Ryoka’s face was blank. Then, slowly, she stood up. She rested her full weight on both legs and then on her bad leg. She took one step and then two. Then—\nShe smiled.\n“How’s it feel—”\nCalruz nudged Gerial and cut the other man off. He watched as Ryoka took another step and then stretched her leg out. She gingerly tested her leg by taking a few forceful steps. Then she hopped up and down.\nRyoka spun on one leg. Then she jumped and kicked out with it before landing and doing a pivot-kick that cut the air. The adventurers blinked, impressed.\nHop, spin, kick, jump. Ryoka leapt about the grass like a monkey, or a martial artist if you wanted to be flattering. She did a cartwheel and then a spinning back kick. At this point, Gerial and the other adventurers were gaping openly, and that was before Ryoka started doing back handsprings and front flips.\n“I take it you’re feeling better, Ryoka?”\nThe young woman stopped and grinned at Ceria. She flicked some sweat off her forehead.\n“I’m great. Better than great.”\nThis time, Calruz was the one who was lost for words. Gerial had plenty, though. He stared openly at Ryoka.\n“How did—I’ve never seen anyone do\nthat.\n”\nThe other adventurers nodded in agreement, but one of the mages shook his head.\n“I have. Tumblers and performers have those kinds of Skills. Do you have the [Performer] class, Miss Ryoka?”\nShe looked at him, mildly insulted.\n“No, I’ve just got\nskill\n. You should see me do parkour or tricking.”\n“Par—what?”\n“It’s a type of running. Or—I guess you could call it a type of martial arts.”\nAgain, Ryoka had lost her audience.\n“Marital what?”\n“I’ve heard of that.”\nCeria nodded and smiled at Ryoka.\n“You\nare\nfull of surprises, aren’t you? And your leg doesn’t hurt? You don’t feel any twinges or pain?”\nRyoka smiled.\n“None.”\n“Pisces did his work well, then. I thought he would. He might be an idiot, but he’s a competent one.”\nGerial cleared his throat.\n“I’m glad. Well, uh, what should we do now? It’s been a long trip, and there’s the inn or Liscor…Ryoka, did you want to, uh, do anything?”\nThe Horns of Hammerad stared at Ryoka. She was practically vibrating with energy, unable to sit still.\n“I’m going to run back.”\n“What?”\n“I’ve gotta run. Sorry but—”\nGerial and the other Horns of Hammerad exchanged glances. The male [Warrior] nodded and grinned at her.\n“We understand. I’ve broken bones before, too.”\nRyoka nodded. She was already looking at the wide, open plains. But then she looked back and hesitated.\n“I don’t want to get in your way. I can probably find my way back on my own if you want to stay—”\n“Nonsense.”\nThis time, it was Calruz who interrupted. The Minotaur snorted.\n“We’ll follow in the wagon and pick you up when you slow down. There’s over a hundred miles between here and Celum. Even I—you couldn’t run that far.”\nShe gave him a grin. Even now, with the best intentions in the world—his comment made something flare up in her chest. She put her hands on her hips.\n“Wanna bet?”\nHe blinked at her, and Ryoka hesitated.\nWait, wait, don’t—\nshe tried again.\n“Um, thanks anyways, though. But if you need to rest—I know you were up all night.”\n“We’ll give the horses a stamina potion, don’t worry.”\n“\nPonies!\n”\nThe [Driver] was still waiting by the wagon. The half-Elf rolled her eyes and smiled at Ryoka.\n“If you’re going to run, stick to the road. Monsters around here are fairly dangerous. Stay away from the big rocks. They’re actually giant monsters in disguise.”\nAll of the other Horns of Hammerad eyed Ceria askance. But Ryoka just nodded. Her entire body was coiled like a spring. But again, she paused before running.\n“Thank you. I really mean it.”\nCalruz snorted.\n“Enough words. Run already!”\nRyoka nodded at the adventurers. She gave them a rare, full smile, and at least a few hearts in the Horns of Hammerad skipped a beat. Then she took off.\nCalruz must have had the idea to run with Ryoka, at least for a while, because he took off with her. He got ten steps before she’d left him completely behind. Ceria whistled softly as she saw Ryoka blaze through the grasslands.\n“Let’s see if our [Wagon Driver] wants a break and get on the road if you want to follow her, Gerial. It looks like she’ll go at least forty miles before she runs out of steam.”\nGerial nodded and began ordering the Horns around, although they already knew what to do. Calruz stomped back, looking half-pleased, half-disgruntled.\n“Fast. But that’s why she is worthy.”\nCeria eyed him while Gerial deliberately began fiddling with a blue potion he’d pulled from his pack.\n“It’s worth repaying our debt to her, but it’s too bad we can’t stay in Liscor, Calruz. You know those new ruins are nearby. It might be worth getting the drop on the other adventuring teams and exploring it first.”\nHe shook his head.\n“Not without a full-fighting party. There’s a reason none of the cowards around here have dared breach the upper levels yet. If we come back, it will be after we know what monsters have been sighted there and our wounded have recovered.”\n“Practical, I suppose. I’m just surprised to hear that coming from you, Calruz.”\nCalruz eyed Ceria irritably.\n“Why? Because I am a Minotaur?”\nHer gaze didn’t waver.\n“No, because you’re\nyou.\n”\nHe snorted and grinned. The Minotaur was one of the Beriad, whatever that meant, and he sometimes showed his talents. Such as now as he eyed Liscor in the distance.\n“I’m no fool, and the Horns of Hammerad aren’t Gold-ranked. Not\nyet.\nA proper strike force will take setting up. Let alone the provisioning. We will wait. Now, let us follow the quick Ryoka Griffin.”\nThe female [Mage] groaned as she climbed into the wagon.\n“Another day and night of riding. Too bad we couldn’t stay at the inn.”\nCalruz eyed the currently empty inn and shook his head.\n“Bah, it doesn’t look that inviting anyways. It’s got holes in the roof, and if the [Necromancer]’s a customer, I shudder to think what the rest of the guests are like. Let’s go!”\nThe Horns of Hammerad set out, travelling down the central slope and for several miles until they found the main road. They kept going for an hour before Gerial raised his head and sniffed from the driver’s seat.\n“…Does anyone smell smoke?”",

    "text": "Ryoka ran. She ran through the grass and kicked off the ground. With every step, she felt like she was being reborn. And she was running fast, perhaps faster than she’d ever run before. Her wings were back.\nShe crested a hill, stormed down it in half a second, and then hit the flat ground before another crest made her dig into the soft grass. The bumpy landscape of the area was perfect for muscle training, if she’d been so inclined. But as it was, Ryoka was just enjoying the feeling of running again.\nShe kept to the main road. Even with all the passion in her soul, Ryoka wasn’t about to risk running into whatever monsters Ceria had mentioned. She eyed the large, immobile rocks as she ran and wondered what was living underneath them.\nAt this time of day, the road was actually crowded with a few travellers. Ryoka either hadn’t seen them in her delirious ride to Liscor, or it had been too late at night/early in the morning. But now she saw merchants riding in armed caravans, farmers sitting on wagons, and even the lone traveller. Some were Human. Most were not.\nGiant lizards. Hairy dog-people. Ryoka would have stopped and stared—or discreetly observed them—but the fire of running was burning her from the inside out. She ran at a good distance from the road as she flashed by the travellers. In turn, they stared at the Human running by them with undisguised curiosity and amazement.\nMerchants, traders, travellers, peddlers, caravan guards, farmers, and the occasional group of adventurers all travelled the road to Liscor. Oh, and one more group.\n[Guards].\nRyoka blitzed by a party of Gnolls, who sniffed and turned their heads almost too late to see her go by when she saw the group of armed Drakes. They reacted to her presence by reaching for their weapons, but when they saw it was just a lone Human, they relaxed. All except for one, that was.\nHer legs and body were still fine, but Ryoka was thinking of slowing down to conserve energy when she saw the blur move out of the group of guards and chase after her. She heard the whoops and cheers of the Drakes and realized one of them was trying to race her. Ryoka looked over her shoulder.\nA green blur was charging after her. It was one of the guardsmen, a big Drake with a spear on his back. Another one of the bonehead types who thought they could outrun her just to show off to their friends. She increased her pace. And…so did he.\nHe was\nfast\n. Ryoka sensed him behind her, and then he was right next to her. She gaped as he appeared by her side, giving her a smug grin. He was\nhuge\n, and he was carrying a weapon and wearing armor, but he still was nearly as fast as she was. Nearly.\nHer feet dug into the soft grass. Ryoka increased the tempo of her legs and went into overdrive. The Drake blinked as she\naccelerated\n. He tried to speed up, and for a few seconds, he managed to keep pace. But Ryoka had wings on her feet, and this was her first run in nearly a week. He might as well have tried to catch the wind.\n“\nHey! Wait! No fair! Let me take off my armor! And my boots!\n”\nHe began to shout, panting, and she laughed at him without slowing down.\nHow fast was she going? Ryoka saw the travellers on the road blur and then disappear with each step. She was in a completely different world of her own now, and even the insanely fast Drake couldn’t keep up. This was her world, a world few people would ever know.\nFor a second, Ryoka wished her iPhone were working so she could listen to some music or record herself running for one of the compilation videos on Youtube. But then she left those thoughts behind. She ran.\nThe guardsman fell behind. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t keep up with her. Ryoka turned her head and flashed him a smile for a good race. He desperately pumped his arms and his legs, but his weird speed was no match for her. And his posture was\nterrible.\nWait.\nWas\nhe wearing armor? And carrying a spear?\nShe heard him call out after her, but Ryoka had hit the zone, and she couldn’t be stopped. She ran on and smiled into the breeze. The feeling was back. She was back.\nShe was free.",

A nearby caravan of Human traders stared in amazement at him, but that was only because they were far too late to admire the runner still sprinting in the distance.\nFrustrated, the Drake pulled his spear out and stabbed the ground. This was a first. He’d never—well, seldom ever been outrun. And never by a Human. He stared at Ryoka’s tiny back with a hint of admiration in his eyes.\nThen he turned and began trudging back to the group of guards he’d left. They were several miles away. Relc grumbled about the inconvenience, conveniently forgetting he’d been the one to challenge Ryoka to a race. He took one more glance into the distance, but couldn’t see Ryoka’s figure anymore.\n“Humans. Huh. I wonder if Erin knows her?”",

    "text": "Somewhere around the same time, Erin Solstice wasn’t shopping. Nor was she in Liscor. In fact, she’d left the city several hours ago. Right now, she was lost.\nNot\ncompletely\nlost. She knew where Liscor was—roughly. She could follow the mountain range to get to it and therefore back to her inn. So she wasn’t lost in the grand scale of things.\nBut on a closer, localized level, she was very lost. In fact, Erin would go as far as to say she was completely lost.\nShe’d left The Wandering Inn behind with her supplies and then…\nIt was like stepping into a maze, but instead of the walls being vertical, they were all horizontal. Erin frowned. Did that make sense?\nThe hills and valleys of the grasslands were nearly indistinguishable from the flat ground at a distance, and the uniform long grass made things worse. Erin had to navigate using what little landmarks she could see by.\nFor instance, there were helpful rocks in the distance…except they occasionally moved around, and getting close to one was a bad idea. Oh, and the grass changed from green to yellow to orange and even purple in lovely patterns!\n…Too bad that changed every day. So yes, Erin had little to navigate by other than the mountains and the few objects tall enough to be seen from every hilltop. This place really wasn’t that diverse in local fauna; most of it seemed hidden by the tall grass.\nThere were patches of red and white flowers that Erin saw now and then in this area, but she had a bad feeling about them. A little bell seemed to go off every time she bent down to pick one up in her head.\n“[Dangersense].”\nAt least, it was probably that. It could just be a random bad feeling, but that was pretty much the same thing when you got down to it. Either way, Erin had decided not to try and smell the pretty flowers.\nShe looked around as she walked through the grasslands. This was amazing. In more than one sense. For one thing, she’d just spotted a road a few miles to the left. A road. She had no idea Liscor even had a road!\nWell, that probably wasn’t\nthat\nbig a surprise. But Erin had just realized how narrow her little world had been. She’d practically lived only in her inn and occasionally in Liscor without exploring any other direction. And why?\nOh yeah, because of the monsters. Well…there weren’t any she could see. Erin wasn’t too far away from the main road, and Selys had said that was the safest area. She’d made Erin promise to stay close to the area the Watch patrolled.\nBut now, Erin had found a forest, and she was going to explore it. Because it was a forest. Literally the only trees Erin had found aside from the blue fruit trees. But these looked like proper trees…except they were missing all their leaves. Long, oddly\nwide\nbranches criss-crossed some vaguely fir-like trees, which had a lot of dark blue-green leaves scattered at the base of the forest in a wide area.\nSturdy, in short, but they’d already lost their leaves. This could have something to do with the season. Apparently, it was around fall, closing in on winter. Erin hadn’t believed it, but Selys had assured her it was true. Apparently, the mountains made it so that the seasons didn’t hit the area around Liscor as hard or something because it wasn’t that chilly.\n“Or maybe this is like Florida or California. No snow, no searing heat. That’d be nice. No, wait, Florida’s got muggy mosquitoes and crocodiles. Michigan rules. Yep, yep.”\nErin muttered to herself as she approached the dry-looking trees. It was a lovely forest and not too far away from her inn. Only…forty minutes if she walked straight? Okay, that was a good distance, but only because Erin was on foot.\nHm. The brown wood of the trees was definitely brighter in color than the ones back in her home. They actually looked closer in color to how trees were drawn, not how they actually looked with all the dark bark, moss, and whatnot. Erin wanted to go closer, but then a bell went off in her head.\nThe [Dangersense]. It had been dinging whenever Erin thought about going close to the flowers, but now it clearly and\ndefinitely\nrang out in her mind. From a little dinging bell to, say…a fire alarm. That level of difference. It was like a bad feeling in her gut—except in her head. And it told Erin that she did\nnot\nwant to get closer to the trees.\nErin quickly stepped back. Something was wrong with the forest. But what? They were just trees. But was something living in the forest? In the\ntrees?\nCautiously, Erin reached into the bag she was carrying with her. She’d brought a small rucksack loaded with a few essentials for a day-long exploration. It hadn’t been too expensive, and she had wanted to be prepared. It wasn’t as if she were\ncompletely\nreckless like Selys and Krshia clearly thought she was.\nErin rummaged with one hand as she kept an eye on the forest. It was hard to feel around in her bag without looking, especially because she wanted to keep a certain item in there from breaking. Where was it…?\nShe’d brought a flint and steel and tinder, which she actually knew how to use in case she needed to make a torch. Not that she planned on exploring any caves, but it seemed like a practical choice. There were also bandages, but Erin didn’t want them. Her hand rummaged through the rucksack blindly.\nShe also had a long knife in a leather sheath she’d bought from the Adventurer’s Guild. They sold a number of items for adventurers behind their counter, and once Selys realized Erin wasn’t going to be dissuaded, she’d insisted Erin take one.\nAnd a healing potion, of course. It was expensive—nearly a gold coin even for a weak potion, but Erin would have bought one regardless of the price. She’d learned her lesson.\nSomething smooth. That was the hand mirror. Apparently, this was an adventurer’s tool to check for injuries like poison barbs or in case of basilisk attacks. Whether or not basilisks actually existed…Erin had figured she could use a mirror anyways.\nShe’d bought it because she really wanted one, but the thought of a grizzled warrior checking out his appearance was also pretty funny.\nErin had laughed, but then Selys had told her about how some bugs could sink into an adventurer’s skin and lay eggs that would hatch and eat them from inside out. That had been disgusting and made Erin feel like a jerk for laughing. But it still hadn’t stopped her from exploring, especially after Selys admitted those insects didn’t live anywhere near Liscor.\nSelys didn’t seem to get it. Come to that, Krshia didn’t really get it either. The Gnoll seemed to think Erin was trying to avenge Klbkch. She’d offered to come along to ‘hunt’ with Erin, but Erin had refused.\nNone of them really understood. They thought Erin was crazy, and she probably was, but her reason made sense to Erin. This was something she had to do.\n“I wish—”\nErin broke off and shook her head. What was she doing? Erin stared blankly at the object she’d pulled out of her pack. Oh, right.\nShe was holding a rock. In fairness, it was a nice rock. Rough around the edges, true, but a prime specimen of a rock nonetheless. Erin could hold this rock and know it was definitely made of stone. It was nicely heavy too, and it was her prime defense against anything.\nErin hefted it and squinted at the tree. Hm. She backed up until she was around fifty feet away. That seemed safe enough. Then she lifted the rock, took aim, and\nthrew.\nErin had never played baseball as a kid. It was a boy’s game, at least where she’d grown up, and they were all jerks when it came to letting girls have a turn. But she’d played catch now and then, and there were plenty of baseball games on TV that she would occasionally watch. In short, Erin had a pretty good idea of how fast a baseball could be thrown.\nThe rock she tossed had about the same velocity as a fastball. Not a major-league fastball, the kind that could dent metal or kill people but—actually, this was a rock. It could totally kill people, even at Erin’s slower velocity.\nAnd it had perfect accuracy. Erin watched the rock she’d thrown strike one the trees dead center, hard enough to dent the bark. Another Skill. [Unerring Throw]. With it, Erin literally couldn’t miss.\nThe rock fell to the ground. Erin watched the tree. The branches were shaking from the impact, but nothing else happened. Maybe there wasn’t anything living in the trees after all. Or maybe it was hiding or only lived in certain trees or somewhere deeper in the forest. Or maybe—\nWaitaminute. Erin froze. The branches were still quivering long after the impact. Why were they doing that? But the tree seemed to\nflex and—\nHer body was diving, so Erin didn’t see what happened at first—just the\nroar\nof sound like a thousand popcorn kernels exploding. Popcorn kernels the size of car tires with the sound of a car backfiring, maybe. And the tree erupted into…\nFireworks.\nEach branch and twig on the upper section of the tree instantly and spontaneously exploded outwards like a shrapnel bomb going off. Acorns, pieces of bark, and small bits of the branch fired outwards, thousands of bullets.\nErin dove to the ground as the deadly wooden hail rained around her. She was lucky. The explosion was far enough away that most of what hit her had lost its momentum. She felt bits of wood showering her as she covered her head with her hand. A few sharp impacts struck her clothing—but Erin was mostly just terrified.\nOnly when she was quite,\nquite\nsure everything had stopped did Erin look up.\nThe tree was completely denuded of bark and most of its smaller branches. It stood among its fellows, the pale yellow-green-white of its trunk showing. Around it in a hundred meter radius, bits of the tree lay on the grass.\nShakily, Erin got to her feet. She felt something trickling down her face and touched at her cheek. Something—an acorn—had cut a shallow gash down her left cheek. She looked at the blood on her fingertips and tried not to throw up.",

    "text": "It was only after she’d put at least a mile between her and the exploding trees that Erin stopped to call herself twenty kinds of stupid. Then she decided never to ever go near anything tree-related again without a flamethrower. Monsters were one thing, but this—\nErin sighed and sat down on a small hill. Well, that was probably why no one explored around this area. Exploding trees. Unless you were wearing armor—and even if you were—those things were deadly. She imagined what would happen if Rags and her Goblin friends tried to gather firewood from the trees and shuddered.\nCuriously, her near-death experience left Erin ravenous. She opened her rucksack and fished around cautiously inside until she pulled something squishy out. She unwrapped the wax paper and revealed a slightly squashed sandwich. Apparently, Drakes weren’t the biggest bread-fans in the world—and neither were Gnolls.\nOh, they respected the stuff enough to make sandwiches, but Erin had learned that they were closer to carnivores than Humans. But their sandwiches still tasted great. This particular sandwich had mustard, or something sweet that tasted vaguely like it, cheese, and a\nlot\nof meat. Erin devoured it and then wished she hadn’t eaten so quickly. She clutched at her stomach, and then she saw the spider.\n“Oh god.”\nIt was a large spider. It had a bright yellow pattern on its back, almost like a melted skull or face, yellow and brown. The back carapace was twice as wide as a tennis racket, and huge legs crawled the spider forwards as its black eyes,\ndozens\nof bulbs staring blankly ahead, let it scuttle through the grass while seeing in every direction. A large—no,\nhuge\nspider. And it had—\n“Oh god. Is that\narmor?\n”\nMaybe it wasn’t armor. Maybe it was. But the yellow and black pattern on the spider’s back made the thick layer of…carapace look even more sinister than it was. It looked like a blown up house-spider with plated armor, especially in the way the plating covered the giant spider’s legs and the top of its body. Erin was pretty sure it\nwas\narmor.\nClick.\nThe spider\nclicked\nits mandibles together as it approached Erin. She froze up, but then grabbed her rucksack and scrambled away. The spider scuttled faster, and Erin backed up even faster.\nShe turned and ran. That was, until Erin’s [Dangersense] went off like alarm bells. She stopped in place. What was—\nIt was nearly too late. Erin was just about to take another step when she noticed the odd way the ground seemed\nflimsy\nin front of her feet. She took a look behind her—the armored spider was still a ways away. She kicked at the ground, and it collapsed.\nA huge pit opened up in front of Erin. The fake earth—in fact, some kind of green amalgam of dead grass and sticks—fell down, and Erin stared down into the face of hell. A nest full of spiders. And eggs.\nThey were everywhere, tiny spiders, big spiders, and eggs. So many white egg sacs that lay on the ground and walls of the massive cavern like obscene fungi. And as the trap ground fell in, they all surged into frantic motion. A writhing horde of legs\nskritched\ntogether as they swarmed the bits of dirt right below Erin.\nSpiders began scurrying all over the huge nest, scurrying all over each other as they searched for the prey that had fallen into their nest. Their pincers opened and closed, revealing fleshy…insides, biting at the air hungrily. Meanwhile, the prey standing at the edge of the nest backed away in horror.\nIt was only when she heard the\nscuttling\nof the other armored spider that Erin remembered it was behind her. She turned, screamed, and ran around the edge of the pit. It followed her, but interestingly, the other spiders in the cavern below didn’t. They were still mindlessly swarming around the ground, protecting the eggs and searching for something to eat. But the large one was still hunting her.\nShe ran. It followed. Slowly, quietly. Even after Erin had run several hundred meters, she could turn around and still see it approaching. And then she realized it wasn’t going to stop. It was a premonition. The spider was going to follow her until she stopped.\nSo Erin slowed from her run to a walk. She turned around and took the rucksack off her back. Erin reached inside and pulled out two things: a rock and a small jar stoppered up extremely thoroughly. She placed the jar at her feet in the grass and hefted the rock.\nIt was stupid to go exploring.\nSelys had told her that a hundred times. Krshia had said the same thing, but she’d suggested coming along with Erin with a few more Gnolls. Erin had shot down both ideas. She had to do this alone.\nMaybe it was going to kill her, but Erin had woken up screaming and crying every night since Klbkch died. So she didn’t run. She picked up the rock and aimed at the spider.\nIts head was black, and Erin couldn’t make out any features. Just the bulbous eyes, like a fungoid growth—no pupils and, somehow, even less like a person’s face than the Antinium’s multi-faceted eyes. She expected the spider to have large jaws or something, but the pincers were small. It was still oversized and horrific.\n“I’d say stop, but you don’t understand me, do you? Last chance!”\nThe [Innkeeper] shouted just in case the spider could hear her. It slowed…slightly, and she wavered, but the spider then began to scuttle even faster. Erin waited another second, then hurled the rock at its head.\nThe stone smashed into the spider’s head and crushed one eye. Greenish blood oozed from the broken orbs as Erin recoiled. The spider reeled back and emitted a high-pitched noise that Erin could only half-hear. For a second, she thought it had worked and the spider would run. But then the spider ducked low to the ground and\nadvanced\n.\nIts remaining eyes stared blankly at her as green ooze ran down its face. Now Erin knew spiders bled. But the armor covering the spider’s head hadn’t even cracked from the rock. Erin stared at the spider. It was coming.\nHuge. Nearly half as tall as she was—albeit long on the ground. Every instinct in Erin was telling her to run. But she didn’t. If she ran, it would follow her.\nIf she ran far enough, maybe she’d be able to get to the city before she ran out of energy. Maybe she’d run right into another pit trap. But either way, someone would have to kill the spider. If not her, then a guardsman. Relc or Pisces. Or even Rags. Someone would have to fight in the end, and someone might die.\nSo Erin didn’t run. She held her ground and stared at the spider. It would kill her or she would kill it. She knew that would be the case, and she didn’t run. Because that was the reason she was out here.\nTo never see someone die protecting her. To never hold them in her arms and hear their last words. To never cry and feel guilt without end.\nTo never be weak again.\nSo instead of running, Erin picked up the glass jar she’d placed in the grass. She threw it at the charging spider.\nThe jar broke, and the green liquid covered the armored spider. This time, however, it wasn’t the impact that mattered.\nThe spider slowed as the green liquid covered it and instantly began to smoke. This time, its\nscreech\nwas longer, more protracted.\nAcid.\nAcid from the Acid Flies. It ate away at the spider, and Erin saw smoke rising from its armor. The acid bit into the spider’s armor, but again, it wasn’t enough. The spider curled up on the grass as smoke rose from its armor and clawed frantically at its ‘face’. But then the smoking eventually stopped and the spider got up.\nOf all the—\nErin had been sure that the acid from the flies would have dissolved her flesh in a moment. But it occurred to her—belatedly—that of all the species endemic to this area, spiders\nwould\nbe the one species resistant to their natural prey—\nflies!\nToo late to regret not taking two jars. Erin waited. She’d blinded the creature, but now she was fighting a half-blind spider covered in acid that ate away flesh. It approached, and she saw the yellow and black plated exoskeleton was pitted with the green of the Acid Flies. But it wasn’t enough.\nErin reached into her pack and drew out the knife. She threw it, and the blade spun through the air and bounced off the spider’s head. Useless. Erin emptied the rucksack and wrapped it around one hand. She walked forward slowly.\nHer ears were pounding. Blood and her crashing heartbeat drowned out everything else. The spider hesitated as Erin walked towards it. It touched the ground delicately with one foreleg and tried to circle. Erin didn’t. She walked towards it. Her eyes stared at a monster scarier than anything else she’d ever seen in her world. But she didn’t run.\nErin stopped a few feet away from the spider. Her pulse was electric; her stomach was missing. She looked down upon it, and the spider hesitated. Erin spoke to it.\n“I’ve held a dying friend and known pain. Try and kill me. You can’t eat a broken heart.”\nShe raised her fists.\n“Come on. I’ll bury you deep.”",

    "text": "A wind blew down from over the mountains. It was a strong wind, but tired. After hundreds of miles, the gale that had blasted across the sea was no more than a whisper. But it was enough. It carried smoke and burning on the wind.\nThe female adventurer stopped and looked to the north. The wind blew the dreadlocks of her hair, and she brushed at her eye. The smoke was irritating, but she had learned long ago to see even in sandstorms.\nShe had never been here, not along the High Passes. She had often seen the mountain range, but hither-to this day, she had never been allowed to walk this far north on Izril’s land. It would have taken an army to bring her this far, before. She would have been an enemy, and reaching this spot would have meant a triumph, half a continent taken by force of arms.\n…These days, no one contested her simply because of her reputation and because all wars had ended long ago. These days, she searched for something unique, and even the geography of places she had not been did not excite her.\nShe had seen every wonder, ridden across great nations, fought in the greatest wars of this generation, and seen millions bend knee, if not to her, then to the man she rode behind.\nSmoke, this mildly unique geography, held little intrinsic interest to her anymore.\nStill, it was curious because she’d heard no one lived out in the wilds. Perhaps a [Hunter]? She had all the time in the world, so the adventurer walked towards the smoke. She didn’t bother drawing the large sword resting along her back in a huge sheath. She couldn’t carry it at her side because the blade was too long.\nShe had no need of it yet. Her confidence was not unfounded either.\nThe woman wore armor made out of some dark metal. Not dark in the sense of jet-black iron or the lightless color of obsidian—just dark, orange-brown metal. From afar, it almost looked like rust, but the armor wasn’t rusty. In fact, it was fairly clean—it was just the metal that gave off that impression.\nIt had never been broken. Not by magic or force of arms, and she had worn it for decades. It was like the adventurer’s second skin, and it did not impede her movement as she strode towards the smoke. But she stopped as she saw the spider.\nIt was crawling up from a hole in the side of a hill. Burning wood had been placed around the gap, but the spider was determined. It shoved its way past the fire, screeching horribly and smoking. When it saw the female adventurer, it reacted instantly. The spider lunged.\nThe adventurer drew her sword and cut twice. The spider fell to the ground, legs and abdomen severed. Yellow pus oozed from its backside as the adventurer studied it.\n“Kingslayer Spiders? No—Shield Spiders.”\nShe left the Shield Spider where it lay. The adventurer continued onwards, and upon reaching the top of the hill, she saw the main source of the black fumes.\nA large pit was giving off black smoke. Orange sparks and a terrible red glow lit the edges of the pit like a gateway to some abyssal plane. But that wasn’t what drew the adventurer’s eye.\nA girl was sitting by herself at the edge of the smoking pit. She stared into it, ignoring the small campfire on her right. She was hugging her knees as she stared down. She did not see or hear the second spider crawling up behind her.\nIt lunged. The adventurer gripped her sword, but the girl at the edge of the pit moved like lightning. She rolled sideways even as the Shield Spider launched itself at her back. The momentum carried the spider over the ledge and into the smoking hole. The adventurer heard an agonized\nshriek\nfrom the spider as the girl went back to sit at the edge of the hole.\nCautiously, the adventurer approached. Not out of fear for herself, but she was studying the girl with a great deal of confusion. Her eye narrowed as she appraised the girl. And she was a girl, especially to the adventurer.\nAs she moved closer, the girl looked up at her. She was Human. She didn’t stand up, but merely angled the thing at her feet more precisely.\nA small mirror lay in the grass in front of the girl, reflecting the landscape behind her. It was propped up on a small backpack, or what remained of one. In truth, it was more like a pile of cloth scraps.\nThe adventurer eyed the girl. She seemed unharmed. But she also didn’t appear inclined to chat. So the adventurer cleared her throat.\n“Hello there.”\n“Hello.”\nThe girl didn’t glance up. She hugged her knees and stared down into the smoke. Curious, the adventurer drew closer. Her hand wasn’t gripping her sword, but neither was she unwary.\nNow that she was only a few feet away, she could feel the heat radiating out of the pit. It was intense, but it was a fire in its final stages. Clearly, the fire had been going for quite some time, but again, that wasn’t what drew the adventurer’s attention. No, it was the many shapes that lay curled up at the bottom of the fiery pit.\nSpiders.\nThey lay in droves, their armored carcasses smoking and burning horribly in the flames that danced around the edge of the hole in the ground. Some had tried to climb. They hung, dangling, their legs still planted in the dirt walls where they had perished.\n“A nest. I have heard they are a hazard around here to travellers.”\n“Yeah. It’d be bad if you fell in without seeing it first.”\nThe adventurer blinked her eye at the girl.\n“Did you do this? By yourself?”\n“Yeah.”\n“May I ask how?”\nThe Human girl paused. She rocked back and forth for a while before responding.\n“I closed off all the entrances with dried grass and wood. Then I started tossing burning branches into the pit.”\n“Where did you get the wood?”\n“There’s a forest over there. Bunch of trees and lots of dead wood.”\nThe adventurer glanced over in the direction the girl was pointing. She nodded.\n“Krakk trees. They do burn well, but you were lucky none of them exploded. They do that quite often, and the shrapnel is deadly.”\n“They did explode.”\nThe adventurer raised an eyebrow. She looked at the girl with one eye and then opened several more to study her more fully.\n“Oh?”\n“I threw rocks at the trees until they exploded. Then I picked up the branches. It’s not dangerous if you make them explode first.”\n“I see. Clever.”\n“Thanks.”\nOne of the adventurer’s eyes glanced over to her right. At the corpse of the spider battered to death.\n“Did you do that as well?”\n“Yeah.”\n“Few could best a Shield Spider with their bare hands.”\nThe girl shrugged again. She clutched at her arms unconsciously.\n“It wasn’t hard. I flipped it and started stomping.”\n“You have a Skill. [Lesser Strength]. Even so, I see you were injured.”\nThe girl—no, the adventurer saw her name was Erin Solstice—rubbed at her arms. The adventurer could see patches of regrown skin, almost invisible to any eyes but hers, covering her forearms.\n“Yeah. I had a healing potion.”\n“If you’d been bit, the potion would have done you little good. Shield Spiders have a decently strong venom.”\n“Lucky I wasn’t, then.”\nMore silence. The adventurer was slightly surprised. She was used to silence, especially on longer journeys, but she was also used to conversation when she met people. At the very least, she expected questions about her appearance, but the girl had only glanced at her once. She was still staring into the burning pit.\n“Shield Spiders are considered to be a Silver-rank threat. A nest of them though…I wouldn’t be surprised if a team of Gold-rank adventurers were dispatched to handle it.”\n“Okay. Thanks for telling me.”\nIt was odd. Even in her journey north to this part—even on her dry continent she called home—the adventurer was used to people staring at her or reacting in some way to her appearance or her famous name. But the young woman just stared into the fiery pit. Quiet. The woman cleared her throat.\n“You are a Level 11 [Innkeeper]. I am surprised you were able to accomplish such a feat. Few would be so brave, even ten levels higher. And you are no adventurer.”\nThat provoked a response. Two hazel eyes swung up and narrowed slightly, blinking in the smoke.\n“How do you know that about me?”\n“I see it.”\n“Ah.”\nErin stared into the pit for a while. She rocked back and forth.\n“I wanted to see if I could fight. And the spiders—they were going to follow me.”\n“Shield Spiders are notorious for tracking and killing prey across dozens of miles. You were wise not to run.”\n“I guess. But I wanted to fight. To see if I could.”\n“Ah.”\nThe adventurer sat next to Erin. She felt the heat but was not bothered by it. Her eye stung, though.\n“And? What have you learned?”\nErin was silent. She stared into the burning tunnels. Amid the crackling flames, she could hear the spiders screaming.\n“…That I’m good at killing things.”\nThe adventurer was silent. Erin rocked. Back and forth. Back and forth.\n“It’s strange. Up until this point, I never realized I was a murderer.”\nThe adventurer raised her eyebrow.\n“Murderer? That’s an interesting word. I would not use it to describe you.”\n“Oh yeah? Why?”\nThe adventurer spoke as if she were reciting law, with pure confidence.\n“Murder is the sin of taking lives that matter. We who fight such monsters are exterminators. Killers, perhaps; murderers, no. A murderer should not be suffered.”\nHer eye narrowed, and Erin stared at it, then at her hands.\n“I’m not like you. I’m no adventurer. And I don’t want to be. That’s what I learned.”\n“Oh? Then why fight? [Innkeepers] don’t level from fighting monsters.”\nErin laughed shortly and without mirth.\n“You guys all say the same thing. It’s always about leveling with you. That’s not what I\nmeant.\nI—I’m a killer. But I don’t want to be. And I don’t want to be a warrior, either.”\nThe adventurer leaned back on her hands. She studied Erin with her eye. This was a far more fascinating conversation than hundreds she’d had in the last months.\n“Then why fight? Why not run?”\n“So I can defend myself. So I don’t get people killed for trying to protect me.”\n“Ah. But you have done more than that. This nest was a threat to many. You eliminated it. You spoke truly: you do have a talent for fighting.”\nErin stared into the pit.\n“I don’t want to be a killer. So I guess I’m stuck as an innkeeper.”\nThe adventurer didn’t follow her logic and shrugged her armored shoulders.\n“You have talent in killing things. You might be a good adventurer, especially since you wiped out a nest by yourself. Why are you ashamed of—”\nThe adventurer broke off as Erin laughed harshly.\n“Killing? That’s a terrible thing to be good at. No.”\nShe turned—and saw a toothy smile from the woman. A sharp one—for she had sharp teeth. Disappointed as well, for she disagreed.\n“A talent for war is never wasted. What a shame you don’t see it that way.”\nShe stared at the adventurer, and the adventurer felt another mild surprise. There were few who could meet her gaze for long without flinching.\n“…Go away.”\nThe woman closed one eye in a slow blink and inclined her head.\n“My apologies. I didn’t want to offend you.”\n“Too bad. This—this isn’t something to be proud of.”\nErin pointed down into the burning pit. She gestured at the spiders and the white egg sacks slowly burning away. The adventurer could still hear faint shrieks coming from inside the resilient webbing.\n“I killed them.”\nErin whispered it.\n“I killed them all. And they—they\nscream\nwhen they die.”\n“They would have killed you.”\n“Yeah.”\nErin stared as one of the egg sacs below opened up. Small spiders frantically clawed their way out of the webbing and shrieked as they found themselves in the burning pit. They scuttled down across the embers, burning, dying.\n“Babies.”\n“Spawn. They are as dangerous as adults in numbers.”\n“They’re babies.”\nThe female adventurer shrugged. She felt like she was talking with a Djinni—this felt like a game of words and riddles, but this was just a burnt young woman.\n“You might call them that.”\nErin looked down into the pit. She was silent for a minute. The spiders were running about, but the heat from the fire was less. They were dying, but dying slow. She saw one spider caught in the egg sac, frantically trying to escape.\n“If you like, I can end them now—”\nThe adventurer turned to Erin to offer. She blinked as Erin leapt into the burning pit.\nThe smoke obscured Erin from visual sight for a few seconds, but the adventurer could still see her moving around in the pit. She saw Erin fighting through the flames, reaching for something. Then she was dashing towards the edge of the pit.\nThe girl scrabbled at the dirt and managed to get a foothold. But she was hindered by her burden. She managed to pull herself up to the ledge but couldn’t get any higher up. The adventurer stared down until she heard Erin speak.\n“Are you going to pull me up?”\n“Of course.”\nThe adventurer reached down and effortlessly pulled Erin out. The girl was burned, but not badly from the few moments she was in the pit. She opened her left hand and showed the adventurer what she held.\nA baby spider struggled and bit furiously at Erin’s fingers. She’d captured it from the top, so it couldn’t really get at her, but its sharp legs still scrabbled at her fingers.\n“What are you going to do with that?”\nErin shrugged.\n“Dunno. I could raise it.”\n“I wouldn’t. It would bite and consume you first chance it got. Shield Spiders cannot be tamed. Unless you had the [Beastmaster] class, this child will eventually take your life.”\n“Yeah, probably. This was a stupid idea.”\nErin stared down at the spider in her hands. It was trying to bite her.\n“…Sorry. Really, I am.”\nShe held it for another second until the spider’s legs cut open more of her fingers. Then she hurled it back down into the pit. The adventurer studied her. A tear rolled down Erin’s sooty face as she watched the baby spider burn.\n“What a curious Human you are.”\n“…Is that your way of saying I’m an idiot?”\n“Not at all. But I have met many Humans. Many Humans and many races, but never one as curious as you. Many bolder or grander or more dangerous—but never one so oddly as this.”\n“Thanks. I’ve never met anyone like you.”\nThe woman inclined her head. Then, she blinked one huge eye and the other four in rapid succession.\n“I am part Gazer. It is in my ancestry. You may call me by the name others not of my race give me. Gazi.”\n“Oh? I’m Erin Solstice. A…an [Innkeeper].”\n“Yes, I saw.”\nGazi held out her hand. After a moment, Erin took it. It was odd for her to shake Gazi’s hand. For one thing, she had odd arms with another segment to them. But her skin was soft and smooth, even if it were reddish-brown. Really, even her hair looked pretty normal, black lengths tied into dreadlocks. It was only her face that really set her apart.\nOne huge eye stared out at Erin over a mouth filled with sharp teeth. Gazi had no nose. And around her central eye, four smaller eyes opened and studied her with interest. They were not the most unsettling eyes, though each one had a pupil unlike a Human’s. Long and even wobbling, not a perfect circle but an oval, long and lengthwise. The whites of her eyes were closer to a yellow, very faint.\nHer gauntleted hand had four digits too, three fingers and a thumb, which she held out to the young woman.\n“I am pleased to meet you, Innkeeper Solstice. I am an adventurer wandering through these lands.”\n“Nice to meet you. Again. I’ve got an inn nearby. Would you…do you want something to eat?”\nAnother odd offer, but this one made Gazi smile. She nodded and stood in one fluid motion. Her central eye swiveled right, left, up, and down—even backwards into her head, but she fixed the other four on Erin.\n“That would be most welcome.”\n“Okay. Okay then. Follow me.”\nErin picked up the mirror on the ground. She left her sliced up rucksack behind and began walking away from the burning pit. She was…still dazed, but she pointed in the direction of Liscor.\nGazi stared down into the pit and back at Erin. She coughed, again, with mild amusement at the [Innkeeper] and gestured at the embers.\n“Don’t you want to claim the bounty on the Shield Spiders before you go? Their carcasses will not burn up in the flames.”",

Confusion to something everyone knew—so the half-Gazer laughed. Softly, and her huge eye fixed on something creeping up over the hill behind them.\nA Rock Crab was slowly climbing the hill, pincers raised.\nThe half-Gazer stared at it through the back of her head and the hill and the crab’s shell, and the monster froze. It held still and sunk under the stone armor it hid behind as the half-Gazer talked to Erin Solstice.\nThe Rock Crab stayed there, as the two conferred, and didn’t move.

    "text": "At first, the laden cart rumbling through the northern city gates attracted little attention. This late in the day, the traffic going in and out had thinned, but there was nothing odd about two passengers sitting on the back of the cart while a Drake [Farmer] brought his merchandise into market.\nThe expression on the cart driver’s face and the way the guardsmen at the gate reacted when they inspected the bulky objects strapped under the tarp attracted some attention, however. So perhaps one or two [Merchants] made a note to inquire about any unusual shipments, and the extremely bored people-watchers might have drifted that way. But many things passed through Liscor, sometimes objects considered illegal in Human lands or\nvery\nillegal in every land. Those were usually confiscated.\nA wise [Merchant] with illicit cargo skipped Liscor’s annoying gate checks altogether and just sent someone to buy enough food and supplies to continue south or north. This was an odd route, this bridge between Drake and Human lands.\nFor one thing, you could only run it during two seasons out of the year: fall and winter. Spring and Summer were far too dangerous because of the Bloodfields.\nLiscor was definitely no trading city like Pallass, the closest Walled City, but it occasionally got high-profile [Merchants] making a journey that essentially locked them into one part of the continent for a year. Unless they took a sea route to mitigate the High Passes issues.\n“Not a lot of business in Liscor these days, huh? Is this route even worth it?”\nA local Drake [Trader] was commenting idly to a Human busily buying up more hay and bundles of food for his pack animals. They’d have to go just past the Bloodfields…which were probably safe…and it would be a while before they’d reach a settlement again.\n“The Bloodfields run? It’s not something I’d do often, but I have a bunch of ore from Esthelm and Invrisil’s latest fads. It’ll be gold for copper—if the Bloodfields are quiet. I’m bound straight for either Hectval to unload the ore or, if they don’t want what I’m selling, Pallass’ steelworks.”\n“Anyone coming up north?”\nAny important [Merchants], the question meant. The Human resisted saying ‘for what?’ He was one of a few Humans who came to Liscor, and they were all traders, travellers, or adventurers.\nThe city wasn’t exactly fun to be in, and he wanted to be at least cordial with the locals, so he shrugged.\n“Not much call for trade overland. The only one I could think who’d even make the journey is…the Silver Trader. I heard she might be heading north, because of her family.”\n“Oh? Isn’t she from one of your [Lord]-type families?”\n“Mhm. Well, that’s all I need. Can you load them in my wagons?”\n“Sure, I’ll call some [Laborers] over.\nHey! I need eight…\n”\nThe trading area just past the northern gates was fairly busy due to the [Merchant], so the farmer’s odd wagon was unnoticed as yawning Drakes and Gnolls walked over.\nThe two passengers didn’t attract much attention either, at least to begin with. One of the two was a humanoid figure concealing her face with a casual woolen hood. That was normal, although anyone who actually saw the face hiding underneath the hood had a very\ndefinite\nreaction. But because they had to go through shock, denial, and optionally fear/awe, the wake of her passing attracted little notice. Again, at first.\nThe Human was another matter. For many of the Drakes who saw her, she was just another annoying Human arriving as part of the massive influx of adventurers, merchants, and all those seeking to profit from the ruins. At best, she was exploitable and had lots of coin; at worst, the Watch would throw her out if she caused trouble as Humans so often did.\nStill, some of the Drakes recognized the Human girl and remembered that this was the girl who had beaten Olesm in a game of chess and was rumored to have met the Antinium Queen. Not least, the Antinium\nbowed\nto her, which was disturbing. So she attracted the most attention, but only in the form of vague interest at most from Drake observers.\nAmong the few Gnolls in the crowd, however, Erin’s appearance was entirely noticed and significant. Several immediately began walking away through the crowd to find a certain Gnoll shopkeeper, and the rest followed Erin and the mysterious cart.\nThe Human [Merchant] brightened at the sight of another Human face—most of his workers and caravaners for this haul were Drakes and Gnolls, going home. He was about to see what this young woman was doing here when he spotted her companion—and froze. Then he noticed the mysterious cart too.\nWell, mysterious was the wrong word. For the Gnolls, who could smell better than they saw, the contents of the wagon were\ndeeply\ndisturbing. It was only because the contents were also definitely\ndead\nthat they were willing to get near to the wagon at all. Even then, several wrinkled their noses at the burned smell.\nCrowds had a flow and instinct of their own. Despite themselves, passersby felt drawn into the wake of the crowd as they sensed the flow of pedestrians shifting one way. And as a few people in the crowd shouted out the identity of Erin’s companion, and some children peeked underneath the covered wagon and ran away screaming—\nWell, at that point, Erin really wished they would all stop looking at her and Gazi. It wasn’t that she minded the attention…\nActually, she\ndid\nmind the attention. But more than that, she really needed to pee. But she didn’t want to start squirming in front of the nice people, so she suffered in silence. It really was a long way to the Adventurer’s Guild. And it got longer each time more people joined the crowd. She had a feeling that around 10% of the excitement was due to the dead spider corpses packed in the cart, but the other 90% was definitely Gazi.",

    "text": "When Selys saw Erin walk through the doors of the Adventurer’s Guild she couldn’t help calling out.\n“Erin! Thank goodness you’re okay!”\nSelys went from behind the counter to go up to Erin, but she quickly retreated as a flood of people poured into the room behind Erin. She stared at the crowd of pedestrians and then at Erin. Her eyes narrowed suspiciously.\n“…Erin? What’s going on?”\nErin smiled awkwardly.\n“Hi, Selys. Um, I’m here to collect a bounty? That’s how it works, right?”\n“Bounty…?”\nThe Drake stared blankly at Erin until she realized everyone was now looking at her. Then she blushed, or rather, the scales on her face changed color.\n“Oh, of course! You can turn in—you have a\nbounty?\n”\n“Yep.”\nSelys looked Erin up and down. The Human didn’t appear to be carrying anything in her hands or at her side.\n“Is it…Goblin ears?”\n“No…I think they’re called Shield Spiders. Is that right?”\nErin looked at a hooded person standing next to her. Selys’ eye was caught by distinctive features of the half-Gazer as she pushed back her hood. In her mind, an alarm bell went off, but it was temporarily silenced by something Erin had said.\n“Shield Spiders? Erin, that’s not a good—you’re mistaken. Or is this some kind of joke? You can’t be serious.”\nErin shook her head.\n“No, really. There’s a cart of them outside. I didn’t count how many but—”\nErin broke off. Selys was giving her the flat, incredulous look she’d only seen in TV shows before.\n“Shield Spiders?”\n“Uh, yeah.”\n“You. Killed them.”\n“Yeah.”\n“You. Erin Solstice. Killed Shield Spiders.”\nErin felt like she was in a comedy routine, only it was more awkward than funny. She pointed towards the door.\n“Look, they’re right outside. I can go get one if you want.”\nSelys’ gaze shifted over Erin’s shoulder. She appealed to the Drakes in the crowd, many of whom were watching the interchange.\n“\nShield Spiders?\n”\nErin sensed multiple heads nodding behind her. One of the Drakes—this one an adventurer by the sword on his waist and chainmail armor—jerked a thumb at the door.\n“They’re piled up in a cart. I saw them—over sixteen adults, dead and covered in soot. The Watch is trying to get some Workers to unload them, but there’s a huge crowd in the way, and the Workers don’t want to do it.”\nNow that she was listening, Selys could hear the shouting outside. She was still focused on the Erin-factor however, so she kept staring at Erin.\n“\nHow?\nDid an adventurer do it? It can’t have been just you.”\nErin frowned, dignity hurt. Since she agreed with Selys’ incredulousness though, she was only partially indignant.\n“I totally did it by myself. I burned their entire nest. With wood. And fire.”\nShe didn’t know why she felt the need to add that qualifier, but at least it shut Selys up. One of the Drakes—the one with the chainmail—nodded at Erin and flashed her a smile.\n“Fine work. I’ve never seen you around the Guild before. Are you one of the Humans from up north?”\n“What? No. I’m not an adventurer. I’m an [Innkeeper].”\nHe stared. Erin was sort of getting used to that. Selys pulled at the frills at the top of her head.\n“How did you—you know they swarm over anyone that falls into their nest and tear them apart, right?”\nErin nodded.\n“They did that swarming thing—you know, where all of them climb up at once? Wasn’t fun.”\nShe stared at Selys. Selys stared back. After a few moments, Selys threw her hands up.\n“Okay. Okay, I guess—I’ll have to inspect them. And then we’ll need to weigh the bodies. It’ll take all day probably, but if you sign for them, I’ll have your bounty waiting later.”\nShe reached under the counter and pulled out a logbook and handed Erin a quill and inkpot. Erin frowned down at the paper and began scribbling.\n“Do I have to find a place to get rid of them after you’re done? Because I\nreally\ndon’t want to have to dig a hole, and the nest is far away.”\n“No—we’ll definitely take them. Do you even\nknow\nhow valuable Shield Spider bodies are? With the right skills, a [Blacksmith] could create shields, armor…”\n“Really? So the bounty—”\n“Four pieces of silver on average per Shield Spider slain, but we’ll pay you more for their bodies. Especially for the\nbodies.\n”\n“\nI\ndon’t want them. But you might have a tough time getting them down. None of the Workers want to go near them.”\nSelys glanced towards the door.\n“The Antinium\nhate\nspiders. No wonder the Workers are freaking out. I’ll have a few [Porters] do the work instead.”\nSelys put her face in her clawed hand for a second before she looked up at her Human friend again.\n“Erin, how did\nyou\nkill a nest of Shield Spiders? Even if you burned them, most adventurers would rather run than pick a fight with a Shield Spider if they’re not Silver-rank or higher.”\n“Really? They’re that tough?”\nSelys nodded seriously.\n“Incredibly. Steel blades can’t even crack their shells.”\nErin blinked. But then she pointed to the adventurer standing next to her.\n“Well,\nshe\ncut one in half.”\nEvery eye turned towards the Gazer standing next to Erin. Or—as some including Selys recognized—the half-Gazer. A rare species made even rarer by her mixed blood. So rare, in fact, that the odds were if you met one—\nSelys’ scales were usually a good indicator of her mood, along with her tail. Erin watched now as Selys’ tail stiffened like a cat’s, and her light green scales paled until they were nearly gray.\n“Oh. Excuse me.”\nThe half-Gazer looked at Selys and gave her a polite smile. Selys was reduced to nervous stammering.\n“U-um. You wouldn’t happen to be—I mean, are you…?”\n“I am Gazi of Reim.”\nDead silence. If Erin’s comment about taking down a nest of Shield Spiders had inspired quiet hubbub, Gazi’s name brought awestruck silence. Silence—and a kind of fear or intimidation that swept through everyone.\nIn fact, Erin realized she’d been talking to Selys mostly unmolested because the people who had noticed Gazi had turned into virtual statues. Now—at her voice, someone whispered.\n“\nThe King of Destruction’s vassal.\n”\nA shiver ran through the audience. Erin glanced around at the staring crowd. She didn’t get it, but she saw even the biggest, toughest adventurers blanch—and then Gazi\nsmiled,\nand her face was full of teeth.\nErin really wanted to know what all this meant, but she had a pressing concern…and this seemed like a really good time to take care of it. As Selys began stammering something and the adventurers and civilians around Gazi backed up to give her room, Erin pushed her way through the crowd and into the bathroom.\nCuriously, Liscor’s architects didn’t use the stick-man symbols to mark the men’s rooms and the ladies’ rooms apart. Rather, they used tails. A long, straight tail marked the male bathrooms, and a curly tail marked the female bathrooms. It was quite simple when you got used to it. Curly tail, straight tail.\nEven so, Erin peeked inside before she entered. She’d had enough of seeing unwanted genitalia, especially since the equipment the Drakes and Gnolls carried around were\ndefinitely\ndifferent than the ones guys in her world had. Not that she was an expert or anything, but—\nAfter a few minutes of relief and ruminating on biological differences, Erin emerged from the restroom. Thank god for plumbing and soap. She saw Gazi was still at the heart of the crowd of people, fending off questions politely. Her large eye didn’t move from the Gnoll speaking earnestly to her, but one of her smaller eyes swiveled Erin’s way the instant the young woman exited the bathroom.\n“Now\nthat’s\ncreepy.”\nErin muttered.\n“Don’t be rude!”\nSelys hissed at Erin and nearly made the young woman scream. The Drake was heading to the bathroom, probably to relieve tension-induced pressure. She pulled Erin aside, and the two began to whisper furiously in one corner, although only one person in the room was watching them.\n“Erin,\nhow\ndo you know her?”\n“Gazi?”\n“You’re calling her by her\nfirst name?\n”\n“She has a last name?”\n“Pathseeker! And it’s Adventurer Pathseeker! That’s how you should be addressing her. Or Gazi of Reim. Or…\nGazi the Omniscient!\nThat’s her nickname!”\n“That’s confusing. She’s got three different titles? That last one’s sorta cool, I guess.”\nErin was making light of this, but Selys was staring at Gazi in horror, as if afraid the woman would hear them and take offense.\n“Erin! She’s a really,\nreally\nimportant person! I could lose my job if I make her mad!”\n“Really?”\nSelys nodded rapidly.\n“Gazi the Omniscient. That’s what they call her in other continents. She’s rumored to be\nover Level 40.\n”\n“Um.\nWow…?\n”\n“\nErin!\nHow are you not impressed?”\n“Well, isn’t Relc level thirty-something? That’s only a difference of ten levels, right?”\nThe look Selys gave Erin was a mix of incredulity and pure indignation. Not for the first time, Selys wondered if Erin Solstice wasn’t a bit slow or at least\nstrange\n. But she’d said she was from…a different country? Either way, she tried to explain the obvious.\n“Erin, she’s a famous adventurer! You know; the kind people write down if they make a list of the top one hundred adventurers in the world!”\n“Oh.”\n“Don’t you get it? There might be more powerful adventurers, but few of them have ever visited Liscor. And she knows\nyou.\nDid she save you from the Shield Spiders?”\n“No, she only cut one of them apart. But she lent me money to hire the wagon to bring them into the city.”\n“She lent you\nmoney!?\n”\n“Yeah, and I’ll pay her back, so\nstop grabbing\nmy shirt, Selys\n. Look, she just seemed interested in me, but I don’t know her that well. But why do you think—”\nErin got no further because Selys’ claws dug into her arm. She yelped and tried to pry the Drake’s fingers out of her skin.\n“Oh Ancestors! She’s coming\nthis way!\n”\nLike a shark moving through a shoal of fish, Gazi’s presence seemed to literally part the wall of bodies. She approached, smiling at Erin.\n“I fear we must part ways for a time, Erin Solstice. I must greet the master of this guild and the local ruling body. But I hope I may visit you at your inn for your promised meal.”\nSelys’ goggling expression was slightly hard to ignore, but Erin smiled up at Gazi anyways.\n“Sure thing. I’m going back to my inn right away, so you can come over whenever works best.”\nGazi gave her an amused smile that included the petrified Drake at Erin’s side. One of her smaller eyes flipped over, so Erin could only see the light orange-pink of her eyeball.\n“That may be slightly difficult at the moment.”\nSomeone was shouting outside. Or rather, someone was outshouting the shouting already going on outside. It was a familiar voice, too.\n“Hey! Clear the way!”\nRelc’s voice was irate, and he seemed to be yelling at the adventurers and other people trying to crowd into the Adventurer’s Guild. He was also on the verge of losing his temper, which wasn’t usual, but definitely wasn’t helpful at the moment.\n“You lot are causing a disturbance! Clear the street I said!\nMove it!\n”\nEveryone inside the guild heard a\nthump\nand then a shout and a\ncrash\n. For all Gazi was their main focus, their attention quickly turned to the outside.\n“What’s going on? What’s happening?”\nSelys beat Erin to the window and nearly tore her hair-spikes out. Erin still wasn’t sure what to call the crest of hardened…scales or hair each Drake had at the top of their heads.\n“Oh no. He’s picking a fight with the adventurers! That\nidiot!\n”\nErin peered out the window just in time to see an adventurer being lifted off the ground as Relc propped up a guardsman and shoved him into the arms of one of his fellows. It looked like tempers had flared and a guardsman had been knocked down by an adventurer. Possibly it was the other way around, but Erin saw both parties were all-male, so she had a pretty good idea what was going to happen next.\nGazi joined Erin at the window as six of the adventurers squared up and surrounded Relc and the other two guardsmen. Relc glared at them and tightened his fists, but didn’t draw his spear. Gazi stared at him and smiled.\n“Ah. A warrior among civilians. A rare sight in peaceful Izril.”\nOne of the adventurers took a swing at Relc, and he dodged. The Human attacking was nearly as big as the Drake, a muscle-bound giant who looked like the guy who bench-pressed three hundred pounds for fun at the gym.\nErin nudged Gazi in the side. Selys stopped agonizing over the fight long enough to stare at her, but Gazi only looked down. She was wearing armor anyways, so Erin was sure she wasn’t bothering her.\n“Hey, you’re supposed to be strong, aren’t you?”\nGazi nodded. She kept her larger eye trained on Relc while two of the smaller ones flicked towards Erin.\n“Some have called me so, yes.”\n“Why don’t you help him? It’s six against one.”\nErin pointed to the adventurer. He was still missing Relc, but now, another one looked like he was about to sucker-punch the Drake. Relc’s eyes were narrowed, but he seemed to be focused on dodging for the moment.\nGazi smiled down at Erin. She shrugged and indicated the sword at her side. The listeners peered at her, and the half-Gazer’s eye swung around.\n“I do not fight with my fists. If I draw my sword—people die. I would prefer not to.”\nAgain, that shiver, and Erin thought her boast wasn’t much of a boast—but a promise. Gazi nodded at Relc as the big Drake swayed back.\n“Besides—\nhe\nis not the one who needs help.”\nRelc had just jumped nimbly back when the big adventurer’s friend moved forwards. He was another Human not nearly as big, but when he swung at Relc’s back he cut the air with his fist.\nStill, he was far too slow. Even as his fist flew at Relc’s face, the Drake’s bent sideways and hit the adventurer back with an uppercut. Erin thought she actually saw the man’s feet leave the ground before he crumpled in a heap.\nRelc spun around and backhanded the first adventurer, who was still swinging at him. The big guy flipped over and crashed to the ground. Two of his friends came to his aid, but Relc picked one of them up—armor and all—and\nthrew\nhim into the crowd.\nOpen-mouthed, Erin watched as Relc began thrashing the other adventurers. She looked at Selys. The female Drake was covering her eyes and groaning.\n“He\nalways\ndoes this. There’s going to be a\nhuge\nmess because of this, and he’s probably hurt a lot of them badly enough for healing potions!”\n“How—”\nErin blinked and pointed at Relc.\n“I thought—he’s just a guardsman, right? How is\nRelc\ntossing those adventurer guys like flies?”\nGazi studied Relc thoughtfully.\n“He is over Level 30 in the [Spearmaster] class. That would be enough. The highest level among the adventurers is Level 21—the one he has just knocked unconscious. A [Spearmaster] is not an equal to a mere [Warrior], regardless of levels.”\nSelys nodded glumly. She tried to explain to Erin in a way the Human would understand.\n“If we’re just talking about active members of the city guards—then he’s the strongest on the continent, by far. Perhaps the world.”\nErin blinked at her. Twice.\n“The world. As in…all of it?”\nSelys nodded.\n“Most people of his level, well, they either become adventurers, personal bodyguards, or soldiers. Being a city guard doesn’t pay much, but Relc likes it. Probably because it’s so easy.”\nErin paused. She didn’t notice Gazi watching her with one of her eyes. The large one. It studied her with its yellow contents, yellow not white—a shadow-black pupil. But the iris shimmered, blue and green, violet and turquoise, a shifting pattern around the black center. It held Selys’ gaze and hypnotized her a moment, before flicking away.\n“But Klbkch—”\nErin paused and forced herself to go on.\n“He was a Senior Guardsman too, wasn’t he? So weren’t Relc and Klb the same level?”\nSelys shook her head. She watched glumly as Relc threw an adventurer wearing plate mail into the side of the building and\nwinced\nas the outside plaster cracked. Gazi’s head turned, and her eyes focused on Erin. All five of them.\n“Klbkch was the fourth highest-level guardsman in the city. In terms of strength, though, he was probably second to Relc. He was the\nSlayer",

    "text": ", but during the war—look, Erin, both had more levels in other classes, which is why they’re so tough, understand? But even Klbkch was ten levels behind Relc.”\n“Which is a lot, I get it. But how’d Relc get so strong?”\n“He\nwas\nin the army. But he quit to become a guardsman. Thanks to him, we haven’t had to worry about monster attacks for a long while. I’m not sure why Relc quit, though. He was famous as a soldier too.”\nGazi shrugged. Her hand covered the pommel of her sword, and her eyes unfocused for an instant.\n“Many have reasons to leave war. I, too, was a soldier once. As I am sure many know. But I left my position to become an adventurer. It is only worth being a soldier if one has a cause to fight for, a leader to follow, and a reason not to die.”\nBoth Erin and Selys looked up at her. Gazi smiled at them.\n“It is hard to understand, I suppose. But I believe your friend Relc enjoys the quieter moments. Anyone can tire of war. Believe me.”\nThen, suddenly, she looked sad, and Selys gave Gazi another look of awed ‘I know what this is about, and it’s so amazing’. Erin just glanced out the window.\n“Even a street-fight against a dozen guys? Have you done that before?”\n“Many times. That is quite restful compared to war.”\nThe fight was over. Relc planted his foot over a pile of adventurers and raised his fists into the air like a boxer. The cheer he got from the crowd only served to make him preen even more in the spotlight.\nGazi turned away from the window and nodded at Erin.\n“Well, I have not lacked for entertainment since travelling to these lands. I will seek lodgings within the city, then. Good day to you, Erin Solstice. We shall meet again.”\nErin raised a skeptical eyebrow.\n“Oh? You’re so sure?”\nGazi smiled at her without baring her teeth.\n“I foresee it.”\nThe half-Gazer opened the door and strode out. It was so quick that all the tension she’d brought into the room left it in an instant. Selys breathed out hard as she returned to the counter, leaning on it and panting as if winded.\n“I can’t believe that just happened.”\nOne of the adventurers flexed his hand and looked down at it.\n“I shook her hand. And when she looked at me—it was like she knew my\nthoughts.\nThe King of Destruction’s vassal.\nHere.\nNo one’s going to believe I met her.”\n“Amazing.”\nOne of the adventurers agreed. Others nodded their heads as they talked, all in a flurry.\n“What an incredible experience.”\n“We’re not dead. I mean—the King of Destruction’s asleep. But that was—do you think any of the other Seven are here? The Architect? The Lord of the Skies?”\n“No, we’d have heard of it.\nOne\nis bad enough. Two? I bet the Walled Cities would be escorting them everywhere with an army.”\n“Unbelievable.”\n“Eh.”\n“\nEh?\n”\nErin shrugged.\n“I wasn’t too blown away by her. She’s got that ‘mysterious aura’ vibe going on, but it’s all because of her eye, right? I remember seeing this street magician—David Blaine. You ever see—?”\nToo late, she remembered her audience. Selys was giving her an incredulous look along with the other adventurers.\n“What?”\nSelys shook her head slowly. At this point, she wasn’t even that annoyed, just impressed more than anything.\n“You are an amazing Human, Erin. Or an oblivious one. Does nothing faze you?”\n“Lots of things.”\nErin propped her hands on her hips.\n“Why are you all so impressed to see her anyways? She said she was a wanderer.”\n“Yeah, but to see her so far from her home continent—I suppose she really\nis\ndone with war.”\nThe other adventurers agreed. They began talking all at once, arguing, debating in a noisy, confused mess.\n“I wonder what she’s doing away from…? I mean, Chandrar’s still her continent.”\n“I hear she goes through continents looking for challenges. But to come this far—is it because of the new ruins?”\n“Perhaps, but how’d she get word of them so soon? Unless—do you think she was heading to the north already? Terandria, overland? Maybe join in a war as a [Mercenary]?”\n“Doubtful. Adventurers don’t like wars, even the former soldiers. It’d take something truly great to get her to go back to being a soldier. And hey—where’d the Human go?”\nEveryone looked around. The Human, conspicuous because she was a Human, was missing. Selys stared towards the door. It swung closed.\n“\nErin!\n”",

    "text": "Erin heard Selys call her name, but at that point, she was out the door and had no intention of going back in. She appreciated gossip and learning new things as much as anyone, but this wasn’t the time. She was hungry, tired, and\nsore\n. And the last thing she wanted to do was have people ask her more questions and stare at her like…like…\nLike a Human.\nThey were all over the place. Well, not all over, and in fact, there were very few Humans in actuality—perhaps one Human for every four hundred nonhumans, so the odds of seeing any were remote. But to Erin, seeing\none\nHuman was enough to make her stop in her tracks.\nTwo men, a tough-looking adventurer guy in his mid-twenties and a paunchier, richer-dressed merchant, were sitting at an outdoor tavern of some kind, talking to each other. Erin wasn’t sure whether to call it a restaurant. She hesitated and then wandered over, unable to keep away.\n“Uh, hi there.”\nThe adventurer and the [Merchant] looked up. They seemed annoyed to be interrupted, but their expressions cleared as they saw Erin. The man who’d been loading up his wagon smiled genially.\n“Oh—hello! Can we help you, miss?”\n“I’m sorry to interrupt. It’s just—I haven’t seen any Humans in a while.”\nThe [Merchant] raised his eyebrows.\n“It’s a surprise to see anyone but an adventurer or a fellow [Trader] in Liscor. You’re a native here?”\n“Something like that. I thought I was the only Human around here, but suddenly…here you all are.”\n“Ah, well, I’m headed past here, south. On business—Merchant Goeln, a pleasure. Goeln’s Caravans. But I had to see these new ruins before I went off.”\nThe adventurer stood up and held out his hands.\n“Cervial Dermondy, adventurer. Captain of the Flawless Flights, a Silver-rank team. I’m a [Ranger] by trade, scouting out these new ruins that were just discovered. Pleased to meet you, Miss…?”\n“Erin Solstice, um, [Innkeeper]. Mind…mind if I sit?”\n“Oh, of course.”\nThe merchant moved his chair, and the adventurer pulled one close so Erin could sit down. Before she knew it, the merchant had ordered her a drink and they were talking. At first, Erin was surprised, but she fell into the conversation easily. It was just like talking to someone back from her world.\nIt was so\nnormal\nErin could have wept.\nCervial and Goeln had been talking about their grievances with travelling so far to get to Liscor. It seemed everything from wagons breaking down to people getting lost had plagued their caravan, and they’d also found almost all of the inns in the city crowded to the rafters, much to their displeasure.\n“It’s nice to know that there are some Humans living around here. I’ve been dealing with stubborn Gnolls and haughty Drakes all day.”\nThe [Merchant] smiled at Erin while he made a face at the non-Humans passing by on the street. Erin sipped the lukewarm beverage from her mug and made a polite noise to agree with him. The adventurer nodded, chomping down on a baked potato filled with spices.\n“I swear, they’ve raised prices just because they knew we were coming. No love towards us Humans, and the local Watch has been picking fights with the adventurers all week. To make matters worse, it seems there’s a Human [Thief] that came in with one of the caravans.”\n“Really?”\nErin hadn’t heard anything about that. But then she’d been—busy the last few days. The merchant shook his head and made a noise of disgust.\n“Of course, it could be a local Drake or Gnoll, but of course, we Humans get the blame until the culprit is found. Lousy lizards and their damn suspicions.”\nErin blinked at the merchant, but the adventurer was nodding in agreement. She changed the subject quickly.\n“Hey, do you know anything about that new adventurer? Gazi?”\nTwo blank faces were her answer. Erin tried to elaborate.\n“She was getting a lot of attention this morning. She’s, um, she looks\nsort\nof Human, but she’s got one big eye in her head and four small ones…”\n“A Gazer? Gazi? Do you mean…\nGazi the Omniscient?\n”\nThe ball dropped, and then the [Merchant] and adventurer were giving Erin a look as if she had just sprouted wings.\nErin shrugged.\n“She’s a famous adventurer, but that’s all I know—”\n“\nGazi the Omniscient is in Liscor?\nI thought I saw a Gazer, but I didn’t dare believe it was her—dead gods, and I missed her?”\nGoeln leapt out of his chair. Cervial’s mouth was open so wide he could have inhaled an Acid Fly. Ten of them.\n“Adventurer Gazi? I almost missed—did you call her ‘Gazi’?”\n“Well, yeah—”\n“Put some respect on her\nname\n! Adventurer Gazi at least—she’s a\nNamed-rank adventurer!\n”\nCervial looked so horrified Erin began to get a sense that maybe she had been way too informal with the woman. She gulped.\n“I, uh…yeah. She’s here, and I met her on the road. Long story. Is it—is it bad I invited her to my inn?”\nThe two men were practically about to run off to find Gazi, but they turned back at Erin’s words.\n“You have an inn? Here? Really?”\nGoeln was incredulous. Erin nodded.\n“Yep. Well, it’s small, and I just started—it’s just a few miles outside the city.”\n“Really?”\nBoth men leaned over the table. Goeln gave Erin a smile in return.\n“If you’ve got room in your inn, I’d be glad to pay for lodging. It’d be a nice change to see some Human faces rather than all the scales and fur around here. Not to mention the\nsmell!\nAll these non-Humans really don’t know how to wash properly, do they?”\nErin’s smile froze on her face as she stared at the [Merchant]. He hadn’t even tried to lower his voice. She sensed rather than saw the other Drakes sitting at nearby tables slowly glance over at her and the other two Humans. They didn’t seem to notice, nor had Cervial done more than glance at his companion—he hadn’t said a word. Neither had Erin but…\nThe adventurer coughed into one fist.\n“I’d love rooms too; my team’s just here for reconnaissance, but if we come back, a good, friendly inn would be lovely.”\n“Oh. Um, well…I’d love to have you over. But, ah—the upper floors are still under repairs, I’m afraid.”\nBoth looked disappointed.\n“What was the problem? If it’s simple repairs, I could introduce you to some skilled craftsmen…”\nErin waved her hands quickly.\n“No—no need. I’m working on it. It’s just that we had a very bad incident with disappearing skeletons. And—I should get back there to make sure more aren’t missing.”\nHastily, Erin got up and excused herself. The adventurer and merchant bade her farewell and stared after the young woman as she disappeared into the crowd. When she was gone, they exchanged a look. The [Merchant] took a long draft from the fresh mug the Drake had served him and grimaced. Like everything in the city, he could swear the ale they served him was the lowest gutter-scrapings.\n“Disappearing skeletons…?”",

She was not happy.\n“Humans in Liscor? They come seeking the ruins, no doubt, to unearth treasures and seek their fortunes. Good. As for Gazi the Omniscient…she is dangerous. But not a threat to the Hives. She may still be a forerunner of what we desire. Post Listeners on her, but do not gainsay her in any way.”\nThe Antinium addressing her bowed his head crisply. He was perfectly balanced upon one knee as he faced his ruler.\n“Yes, my Queen.”\nShe waved a feeler at him.\n“Such matters are inconvenient, especially at a time like this. Deal with the Council until I have finished. I must not be disturbed at any cost. To complete the project so quickly necessitates all of my attention. Is that clear?”\n“Entirely, my Queen. I will handle all of your affairs with those not of the Hive.”\n“Good. And investigate the Aberration while you are upon the surface. If he is truly Individual, I would speak to him afterwards. If he is not—”\nThe Antinium touched the blades at his sides. The Soldier Antinium standing guard made no move despite his proximity to their Queen.\n“I will dispose of any Aberrations I find, my Queen. Worry not.”\n“I will place my trust in you. Go, then, my Prognugator.”\nThe Antinium bowed and stood. He whirled, and the twin swords at his waist moved smoothly with him as he walked upwards towards the surface. His Queen’s voice rumbled through the cavernous tunnels after him.\n“Go. Ensure that\nHuman\ndoes not bring about further ruin. Protect the Hive and carry out my will.

    "text": "Erin walked down the street, and she felt like sighing. No—she felt like her entire existence was a long, slow sigh.\nShe was tired. Tired and weary in her very bones. But more than that, she was just disappointed. And that was the worst feeling of all.\nHumans.\nShe’d missed them. Really, she had. She’d missed her friends and being back in her home. She even missed the way people said hello as you walked into the supermarket. And she’d been missing all of that so hard that she’d forgotten how nasty people could be.\nThey didn’t like Drakes or Gnolls. Humans. And now that Erin knew that and heard the way Cervial and Goeln talked about Drakes and Gnolls—or at least Goeln—she understood why the feeling was mutual.\nIt was pretty rude to insult an entire species in their own city. Erin wasn’t too sure about much when it came to talking about race, but she was sure of that.\nErin scuffed along Market Street. She wasn’t sure she wanted to buy anything, but she didn’t want to leave the city just yet. Not because she had anything to do here—it was just that the trek back to her inn was too much for her at the moment.\nPoliteness. It was only right to be polite. And that went double for judging an entire species just because you didn’t like their\nsmell\n. Sure, Gnolls could be prickly, but they could also be really nice. The same went for Drakes.\n“There she is! There’s the [Thief]!”\nThen again, there were jerks in every species.\nErin turned around at the voice. It was a familiar voice that set her teeth on edge and made her check her money pouch. Not just because of the thief comment.\nApproaching at a high-speed strut down the street was a Drake shopkeeper. Erin’s eyes narrowed as he barged up to her and began shouting.\n“I know it was you! You couldn’t resist attacking an honest merchant, and you decide to have a bit of revenge, eh?”\n“What?”\nErin blinked at the Drake. He was visibly red with rage. He jabbed at her with a finger, and she stepped back.\n“Enough!”\nAnother Drake pushed his way through the crowd. This one was a Guardsman, and he was visibly harried. He interposed himself between the shopkeeper and Erin.\n“Lism, I’ve told you before. You can’t just start accusing Humans at random!”\n“Ah, but this one is different!”\nLism the shopkeeper pointed at Erin around the guard and raised his voice so more people could hear.\n“\nThis\nis the Human who robbed me of my merchandise! She also cheated at the chess game with my nephew, I’ve no doubt! She’s been nothing but trouble since she entered the city, and now she’s stealing from honest folk trying to make a living!”\nWhat was it about Erin and trouble? It seemed it followed her wherever she went. Erin gritted her teeth.\n“I didn’t\nsteal\nanything. I haven’t even been in the city—”\n“Miss, please.”\nThe guardsman cut her off. He gently moved Lism back.\n“I’ll look into your claims, sir, but I can’t make any arrests. Unless you have proof—”\n“Hey, I said I didn’t\nsteal anything!\n”\n“Hah! Another Human lie!”\nLism jabbed a claw at Erin again, despite the guard’s best attempts to move them apart. Now, Erin was getting mad. She opened her mouth and clenched her fists.\n“I was out of the city all day! I have proof!”\n“Well—”\nThe shopkeeper hesitated, but now he was too far in to back down.\n“It\ncould\nhave been her. You know how Humans get! They’re always sneaking around, going where they’re not wanted.”\n“We’ll investigate your claims. Just please move back—”\n“You can’t trust her word! Get a truth stone! All of these Humans have caused nothing but trouble since they got here! First, they start stealing, and then what? They’ll take our jobs, attack us on the streets—”\n“Please! Move back!”\nThe guard finally managed to pull the enraged shopkeeper away from Erin. He struggled and hollered, but eventually, he let himself be led away. He still shot venomous glances over his shoulder at Erin, which she returned in kind.\nThat was unpleasant. Erin was just about to leave before the jerk came back and shouted some more when the [Guard] returned.\n“Miss?”\n“Oh, hi. Thanks for getting rid of him for me. Was he mad about someone stealing his stuff?”\nThe Drake nodded. He looked out of sorts and tired.\n“There have been a number of petty thefts across the city. Shopkeeper Lism was the latest one to be stolen from.”\n“Well…I’m sorry about that. Good luck finding the criminal.”\nErin tried to excuse herself, but the guardsman shook his head.\n“I’m sorry, Miss, but I’m afraid I’ll have to investigate his claims. If you’ll follow me, I’ll take a statement from you. Just with a truth spell. I’ll also need proof that you were out of the city this morning.”\n“\nWhat?\n”\n“It’s standard procedure—”\n“But I—he—he’s just mad because I beat him at a game of chess! Or—I beat his nephew and—look, I didn’t\ndo\nanything.”\nThe guardsman sighed wearily and raised his hands.\n“I understand, Miss, but I have to investigate all leads. Please, this won’t take too long…”\nErin looked around helplessly. This wasn’t\nfair\n. But who could help her? The other Drakes and Gnolls, well, some of them looked indifferent, others even sympathetic. But some of them were eying her. And none of them would help. What could they do?\nA lot, if one of the people in the crowd was a certain female Gnoll who pushed her way through the throng and marched up to the guardsman. He visibly wilted as Krshia, shopkeeper, Gnoll, and currently Erin’s number one hero folded her arms.\n“What are you doing, if I may ask, guardsman? I hear you are taking an innocent Human away on the word of a petty shopkeeper. But that would be wrong, yes?”\nThe guardsman backed up two steps from the angry Gnoll. He wasn’t a small Drake, but Krshia was big even for a Gnoll, and a few more Gnolls in the crowd were drifting her way.\n“Look, Mistress Krshia, I’m just investigating—”\n“I heard.”\nKrshia sniffed and glanced down the street. Lism, the shopkeeper, ducked back into his stall as she glared in his direction.\n“Lism, the sheddings that he is, talks too much and lies when he knows nothing. Someone broke into his stall, but he saw nothing, heard nothing. But he claims it was a girl who bested him out of spite. And you would bother her without evidence?”\n“That’s not—I’m just doing my job. It’s just a truth spell to make sure she’s innocent. In fact, she can rely on that as proof.”\nThat made sense, and Erin felt it was sorta reasonable, but Krshia’s eyes narrowed.\n“This does make sense—if you had any reason to suspect Miss Solstice. But all you have is Lism’s unfounded claims. She was outside the city most of the day—your colleagues can surely attest to her being at the gates, yes? Why waste truth spells on her? This seems close to harassing her for being a\nHuman…\nmuch like one might question a Gnoll who was anywhere near a crime being committed in another city. But Liscor is not like other Drake cities, no?”\n“I—”\nThe guardsman was torn between duty and not wanting to deal with anything remotely approaching the trouble written on Krshia’s face. He hesitated and then decided as several Gnolls casually walked out of the crowd and joined Krshia. They stood behind her and Erin, not\nlooming\nbut certainly projecting an aura.\n“I believe I’ll continue my investigations into the break-in separately. And confirm with the Watch at the gates before I take up Miss Solstice’s valuable time.”\nKrshia smiled coldly.\n“Yes, that is wise.”\n“Well then.”\nThe guardsman backed off fast. Erin blinked, still confused by what had just happened. The entire moment—well she was grateful for Krshia obviously—but it struck her as slightly wrong that the local law enforcement would back down to a bunch of civilians.\nThen again, when the civilians in question were Gnolls, Erin could see why. Even at their best, they did give off a much more…bestial feel than the Drakes. It wasn’t that Erin expected them to lose their tempers, but she also wouldn’t be too surprised if they did. That kind of feeling.\nKrshia smiled down at Erin as the other Gnolls around her muttered or barked to her. She growled something back to them, and they walked back into the flow of the crowd.\n“Erin Solstice. I have been looking for you. And it is good that I found you just now, yes?”\n“Yes. Thanks for that, Krshia. I didn’t know what to do, and that shopkeeper guy—”\nKrshia narrowed her eyes and snorted.\n“Lism. He causes trouble, yes? Even though you bested him fairly and his nephew is most admiring of you. But enough—I will make sure he causes no trouble. I wish to speak with you.”\n“Um, okay? About what? The thief?”\nKrshia flicked her fingers.\n“Pshaw. It is a cowardly thing that hides and steals from us on Market Street and elsewhere. No one knows if it is Human or another, but the thefts are small. Low-level. No, I do not worry about such a [Thief]. I wish to speak with you privately. I invite you to my home for food and drink.”\nAgain, Erin hesitated. She was grateful but—\n“Um, does it have to be now? I’m really beat, Krshia. I could use a nap—”\n“I have a bed in my home too. You may use it and rest if you wish. Come.”\nGnolls were pushy. Or maybe it was just Krshia. But Erin found herself being dragged down the street before she quite knew what was happening.\n“Look, I’m grateful, really, but this isn’t a good time. I just had to deal with some evil spiders and—”\n“Erin!”\nKrshia ignored Erin and the person calling her name. She marched through the crowd at speed.\n“If we wait for a good time, we will never have time. Come, my home is not far.”\n“Erin! Erin Solstice!”\nKrshia visibly sighed, and her ears\ntwitched\nas the mysterious name-caller drew closer. She halted in the street, and Erin finally managed to extract her hand from the Gnoll’s huge paw. She turned and saw another Drake heading her way.\n“Olesm?”\nThe smaller, younger Drake stopped in front of Erin and Krshia, panting. He was clutching a piece of parchment and a quill and inkpot of all things. For a second, Erin was struck by the sheer inconvenience of not having pens in this world, but then Olesm shoved the paper into her face.\n“Take a look at this, Erin! I just received this, and it’s the most\nfascinating\nthing ever! A new way to play chess!”\nErin blinked, but then the paper disappeared as Krshia gently but firmly pulled Olesm away.\n“Most interesting, but Erin Solstice is busy. I will talk with her, and you will find her later, yes?”\nShe wanted to pull Erin away, but to the Gnoll’s dismay, Erin was already standing next to Olesm.\n“What was that about a new way to play chess?”\nThis time, Krshia groaned, but Erin was already staring at the piece of paper Olesm was eagerly waving about. She tried one last attempt.\n“There is time to play such games later, yes? Erin—”\nBut by that point, Erin and Olesm were already engrossed. Krshia’s ears\ntwitched\nagain, but there was nothing she could do.\n“Just look at this, Erin!”\n“I will if you stop moving. What is it?”\nErin snatched the paper from Olesm’s claw and stared at it. Well, it was a piece of paper. And on that paper was an inked…illustration? Erin frowned, but then she got it. It was chess. Someone had drawn a chess board on the piece of paper.\nShe stared down at a picture—or rather, a drawing of a chess board. Someone had taken the time to draw out the grid and then illustrate—in quite fine detail—each piece on the imaginary board. She stared down at a white king piece, a queen piece in the corner, a knight and a pawn caught in the middle of a game against two black pawn pieces, two rooks, and naturally, a king piece hiding in behind the pawns in the upper left-hand corner.\nOlesm hovered over Erin’s shoulder, chattering into her ear.\n“I just received a long-distance delivery that went out to all the known [Tacticians] and chess players on the continent! From the\nTitan of Baleros!\nOkay, his Great Company, the Forgotten Wing. On Baleros? He can definitely afford it. It was this paper—and it’s a challenge, see? You have to—”\n“Solve it in five moves?”\n“How’d you know?”\nOlesm stared at Erin. She pointed.\n“It’s written right here. And white moves first.”\n“Yes, isn’t it amazing? I would never have thought of that—but someone’s come up with a way to play chess across long distances without a spell! But this isn’t a game at all—”\n“Oh, I know. It’s a chess puzzle.”\nOlesm visibly deflated.\n“You know what it is? But of course—how silly of me.”\nKrshia walked over to stare at the chess boards. She squinted down at the paper and frowned at the pieces.\n“I fail to understand this—puzzle. Why has someone sent it to you, Olesm?”\n“It’s more like a challenge to anyone.”\nErin explained absently as she stared at the chess pieces.\n“It’s a challenge or a problem for players. You have to find a way to win the game in a certain number of moves. It helps people learn to play chess, and this way, you can write it down.”\nOlesm nodded eagerly. He pointed to the paper.\n“In this case, the solution is to checkmate the black king, but I haven’t been able to figure it out yet. I imagine most of the players across the continent are trying to figure it out. It might take some time, but I hope to be one of the first to figure—”\nErin was still staring at the paper. She blinked, frowned, and then snapped her fingers. Both Krshia and Olesm jumped.\n“Hm~! Got it!”\nErin smiled and flicked the chess puzzle with one hand.\n“Done and done!”\n“What?”\nOlesm froze and stared at Erin. She grinned at him.\n“You—you finished it? Just like that?”\n“Yep. It wasn’t too bad a problem. But I’ve seen several like it, so…”\nKrshia glanced sympathetically at Olesm. The poor Drake stared at Erin and then down at the chess puzzle.\n“—I would deeply love to know how you solved it so quickly. But I should—yes, I should solve it on my own. Shouldn’t I?”\nHe looked longingly at the piece of parchment Erin was holding. She grinned and folded it up.\n“You should. It will help you in the long run. Don’t feel bad—I just happened to know how that particular problem goes. But it was quite fun.”\n“Fun.”\nOlesm repeated the word. He looked down at the paper.\n“I’ve been wrestling with this problem for an hour. But—of course with someone of your level I shouldn’t expect this to faze you. Of course.”\n“Do you have any more?”\nOlesm shook his head. He accepted the piece of parchment back from Erin.\n“This was the first—I mean, I suppose we might expect more of the same in the future, wouldn’t we? This puzzle was sent to countless cities. From the Titan. To find good opponents, I bet, and promote his game. I wouldn’t be surprised if more appear soon.”\nErin nodded.\n“Oh, you mean sort of like a magazine, right? Or a newspaper?”\n“A what?”\nBoth Krshia and Olesm looked at Erin blankly. She tried to explain. Olesm nodded his head uncertainly.\n“Yes—yes, that sounds about right.”\n“I’m just surprised. I thought sending stuff was supposed to be costly.”\nOlesm shook his head.\n“It’s not\nthat\nexpensive, especially if you send it with the slower deliveries.”\n“Slower deliveries…?”\nThe Drake nodded. He gestured to the parchment in his hand.\n“This was sent via magic. The Mage’s Guild can print images as well as text—but it’s\nextremely\nexpensive. If it was a letter…again, the Titan can\ndefinitely\nafford magic, but a letter’s a fraction of the cost. And slower. Heck, you don’t even need the Runner’s Guild. You see, Runners deliver things quickly, but merchants and caravans and even ship captains will pass on long-distance deliveries for a very small fee.”\nErin frowned. She sort of got it. It was like snail mail by boat versus sending stuff by plane. And [Message] spells? That sounded like emails! But part of the process still confused her.\n“How does that work if you trade the letter more than once? Do you pay the first guy a lot and have him give the money to the next person? That sounds risky.”\nOlesm scratched at his scales as he tried to explain.",

    "text": "“It’s more like—well, I suppose you could call the letters a form of currency. Travellers will buy them for a few coins and complete the delivery in hopes of earning more when they sell them later or deliver them to their owner. Really, the Runner’s Guild is far more reliable but expensive.”\n“Oh. So it’s sort of a gamble.”\n“Exactly, but it’s fairly certain that the letter will get to your destination in the end. Of course, sending something private is a bad idea, but you can send a message to another continent for only a copper coin or two. It might take a month or two, but it\nwill\nget there.”\nErin nodded. It all made sense. And it reminded her of—well, it reminded her of the post office in a way. Just without stamps. It was useful, it really was.\nIt was just that she was dreaming of email, the internet, and being able to call her family in two seconds at that moment. So she wasn’t that impressed, even though she was really trying to be.\n“I wonder—do you think I could send the answer to the person who sent you the puzzle?”\nOlesm hesitated.\n“I don’t see why not. I mean, I won’t get in touch with the\nTitan\n, just his company. And it costs a bit, but it’s only a few silver for a [Message] spell…I bet he’ll check for answers soon, but not within an hour of sending the puzzle!”\nIt seemed pricier than he wanted, but Erin was getting excited. And so was Olesm at the thought of contacting and impressing this Titan. Was he actually that big?\n“I can write down the answer. Do you have any paper…?”\n“Write it down here. I won’t look.”\nOlesm handed Erin another piece of parchment and averted his eyes as she scribbled on it. She handed it back to him folded up.\n“Okay, so you send it to this person. And then this person will send me something harder?”\n“Perhaps. Or perhaps they might wait until others have sent in their reply. It could take a few weeks or up to a month for a new puzzle.”\n“Aw. That’s a long time.”\n“But it’s so fascinating to play games across such a long distance, isn’t it?”\nErin tried to find the enthusiasm Olesm was giving off, but the truth was this revolutionary idea was small potatoes in her world. She sighed, but then she had a thought.\n“I’ve got a better idea. Here, give me the paper back.”\nShe took the pen and dipped it in the ink pot Olesm held out.\n“They sent me a puzzle, so I can send one back. Let’s see how they like\nthis\n.”\nErin drew out a chess board with every piece in the starting position. She wasn’t an artist, but she did the best she could. Then she wrote in the upper left hand corner:\n‘Black side will mirror white side’s every move. Force checkmate in 4 moves.’\n“It’s a bit elementary, but it should be a good challenge for a beginner. You\ncan\nsend this via letter, if not a [Message] spell thingy?”\nShe showed it to Olesm and Krshia. Olesm frowned at the paper while Krshia shook her head in confusion, but then he smiled.\n“I’m definitely\nnot\npaying for [Messaging] an image. But I could probably send a letter via one of the bulk deliveries! What a fun puzzle! Wait…ah. I actually\nknow\nthis one.”\nOlesm perked right back up and puffed his chest out proudly. Erin’s smile turned upside-down.\n“Wait, what?”\n“Several new players like to challenge me this way. So I grew quite adept at beating them. It is quite a simple solution as I’m sure you know. If you move the queen like so—”\nErin scowled and snatched the parchment back.\n“Give me that.”\nShe flipped it over and began writing furiously on the backside. Olesm blinked, and Krshia grinned in amusement. When Erin showed Olesm the new problem, he blinked.\n“That’s a—a lot of pieces.”\n“Checkmate in four moves. Black moves first.”\nErin grinned evilly at Olesm.\n“\nFour moves?\n”\nHe goggled at the paper. Erin had heard of goggling, but she’d never seen someone actually do it.\n“No. That’s impossible. But—no, it shouldn’t be—”\nHe frowned, his tail lashing the ground.\n“I can’t even begin to—how did you come up with this so quickly?”\n“It was one of the puzzles that gave me a headache back when I was playing a lot. It took me nearly a week to figure it out.”\n“I can’t—may I copy this? Please?”\n“Go ahead. And if you’ll send this back to the person who sent the other puzzle—I’ll pay for delivery.”\n“Oh, of course. Certainly. Um, you can give me a few silver coins and it will get there, but more money means a faster delivery. Sorry, but it\nis\noverseas. Maybe I could get someone to pay for an image-[Message]? But that’s\ngold.\nHow about two silver and I’ll copy this to Baleros for a slow Runner letter—and to Pallass? Maybe someone will send it back to the Titan. They’re all rich in the Walled City. Tons of famous [Strategists]. Heck, the Cyclops of Pallass lives there. Uh, the Grand Strategist of the Drakes.”\n“I get it. Well, not anything of what you just said, but it’s pricey. Okay…”\nErin thought about that and dug in her money pouch. She was feeling generous, so she handed Olesm two silver coins. From what Selys had told her, she’d be rolling in bits of shiny metal soon enough.\nThe Drake blinked down at the coins, but accepted them and promised to send the letter as soon as he copied down Erin’s puzzle. He hurried off, leaving Krshia and Erin behind.\nShe smiled, wondered a bit maliciously how long it would take the mysterious chess puzzler to solve her problem, and then completely forgot about it a minute later.\nKrshia was still trying to get Erin to have a meal with her, but Erin was tired, still sore, and for that matter, hungry. And despite her best wishes towards Gnolls, their food was more than a little raw by Human standards.\n“Look, I’d really love to visit. And I will—how about tomorrow?”\n“But today is quicker, yes?”\n“Yes, but—”\nErin wavered. Krshia enticed her with promises of baked food and meat. And it would be nice, even if she had the feeling the Gnoll wanted to talk to her about something important. Maybe she could relax?\nBut just as she was about to leave with Krshia, someone else called out Erin’s name. This time, Krshia’s ears laid flat on her head, and she turned with a glare. But the Gnoll stopped.\nGazi Pathseeker stood behind Erin in a vortex of attention. She smiled up at Krshia, and the Gnoll stared at her. Erin blinked and sighed as the half-Gazer greeted her.\n“Erin. Is now a good time?”\n“I guess. Did you meet all the important people you were supposed to?”\nGazi shrugged.\n“I have met with various individuals. But I am sure others will introduce themselves when they realize I am in the city. However, I wonder if I might take you up on your offer.”\n“Offer? What offer?”\nErin blinked at Gazi. The adventurer smiled and waved her hand.\n“You mentioned you had an inn. If you wouldn’t mind, I would very much like to see it and have a meal, if I may.”\n“Oh. Of course.”\nErin glanced at Krshia.\n“Sorry, Krshia. It’s just that I promised Gazi—she helped me out earlier today. You don’t mind…?”\nKrshia stood stock still and waved a hand silently at Erin. Gazi smiled in the Gnoll’s direction.\n“Thank you, Shopkeeper Krshia. I apologize for my rudeness.”\nThe Gnoll murmured something, but Erin was already leading Gazi away. Krshia stared at the adventurer’s back and then shook her head. She turned, grabbed the nearest Gnoll, and began speaking quickly with him. She kept casting glances at Gazi’s back the entire time the adventurer was walking away. She hadn’t dared meet the half-Gazer’s eyes, and even now, Krshia’s hair was puffed out.\nShe watched Gazi, but Krshia had no idea—or perhaps she did—that she was being watched right back.",

    "text": "Erin stared in horrified fascination as one of Gazi’s eyeballs slowly rotated to face forwards in her head as the two walked down the street. Apparently, Gazers had 360° vision, which was awesome and incredibly disturbing.\nShe talked to Gazi while the female adventurer’s eyes roamed. She kept her big eye focused on Erin as she walked—out of politeness, Erin guessed, but her other four eyes were all moving in other directions. In fact, it was quite disturbing how Gazi’s big eye didn’t move away from Erin the entire time. Since she had other eyes, she could focus entirely on Erin even while avoiding other pedestrians.\nNot that there were any to get in her or Erin’s way. The other people on the street either knew Gazi or didn’t want to walk in front of the adventurer. She was still dressed like a warrior, and even if her armor looked rusty, she seemed like serious business.\nAll in all—no, Erin wasn’t going to think it. But she couldn’t help it. It really felt like she was talking to a female version of Mad Eye Moody, as wrong as that sounded. A lot less grumpy and with more than one crazy eyeball, but the thought was in her head, and she couldn’t shake it.\nAnd like the Harry Potter characters, Gazi seemed to be a sinkhole for attention. So much so that Erin felt uncomfortable as the two walked down the street towards the gates. She was used to scrutiny, but this time, the Drakes and Gnolls weren’t even bothering to hide their stares. And sure, most were staring at Gazi, but a lot of them were also staring at the weird Human talking to her.\n“You’re really that famous, huh?”\nGazi shrugged, and the armor on her shoulders rolled back.\n“Some might say so. I apologize if the attention bothers you. Do you dislike such things?”\n“Dunno. I’ve never been famous—or popular.”\nGazi nodded.\n“I believe I am more infamous than famous.”\n“I’ve never been that either.”\n“I believe the difference between the two is quite minute in some senses. In others however—well, suffice it to say I appreciate staring as opposed to other reactions. Some cities would not let me past the gates—or even in range of the walls. Nor will I blame them for that.”\n“Right, right. I get you. I think.”\nErin and Gazi stopped at a crowded intersection. Today seemed like a weekend—not that Erin had a good grasp of the week days in this world. She spotted several families out and about, which meant that they’d entered a residential district. She seldom went there, so the sight of children was—\nThey were so small. And\ncute!\nWell, the Gnoll kids reminded Erin of vicious puppies, but the small Drakes were terrifyingly cute. They ran about like normal kids, dragging their shorter tails about as they scuffled, played…did all the things normal kids did, really.\nAs they caught sight of Erin and Gazi, some of the adults stared. But a gang of Drakes and a few Gnolls pointed at Erin instead. One of the children ran up to the two and then away. It was a boy Drake—at least, she thought it was.\nThat was charming, especially the way the group of kids was clearly fascinated with her. Erin was smiling—until she saw the parents.\nTwo Drakes, both with lighter blue scales, watched their offspring run about with his friends with affectionate interest. He ran up to her, and his parents called out, not wanting him to bother Erin. She was caught by the moment and the thought struck her before she could banish it.\nMother, father, and child.\nHer smile flickered and vanished. But then Erin put it back on her face. She bent down towards the young Drake, not looking towards either of the parents.\n“Hi there!”\nErin smiled at the Drake child. He immediately took a step back, but the other children pushed him forward.\n“Can I ask you something?”\nThe boy Drake’s parents waved at him, telling him not to bother the Human. But Erin smiled. She forced the smile, but it was a smile.\n“Go on, I don’t mind. Ask me any question you want.”\nThe Drake grinned up at her. He had\nvery\nsharp teeth. But it was still an innocent smile. A mischievous smile, too.\n“Can you really shoot blood out of your—”",

    "text": "Pisces was sitting at a table in The Wandering Inn, sipping from a mug at his leisure as he put his feet up on one table. At his side, he’d dragged over another table and organized a smorgasbord of cheese, meats, bread, and some sweet pastries Erin had bought for herself last time she’d been in the city.\nHe jumped as the door to the inn smashed open, and Erin stormed in. She was wearing a terrific frown on her face, which contrasted sharply with the amusement on the face of the half-Gazer who followed her in.\nShe didn’t even have to say anything. One look and Pisces’ feet came off the table, and he began industriously polishing the wood with his considerably dirtier robe.\n“Greetings, Mistress Solstice. Ah, are you well?”\nErin stood in the center of the room and glared at everything and nothing.\n“I hate kids. I hate Drakes, and I hate people who don’t understand anything about female anatomy.”\nThat last comment was accompanied by a glare for Pisces. He opened his mouth to protest and then wisely shut up.\n“In case anyone’s wondering, I\ncannot\nshoot blood out of my crotch.”\n“I did not wonder. But it was quite amusing to see your reaction when the child asked you the question.”\nErin glared over her shoulder at the adventurer. Pisces eyed her. There was something familiar—well, unfamiliar, really. He had never seen a Gazer of Baleros. Obviously, he knew the species, but there was only one famous member of them he knew by name.\n…It wasn’t her. Obviously. Erin hadn’t mentioned a name when she wandered into the inn with her guest, but it wasn’t\nher.\nThat would be unbelievable. Pisces was keeping his ear out for a name as Erin ranted. Just because it couldn’t be her.\n“Who\nasks\nthat? Honestly!”\nThe adventurer shrugged. She was looking around the inn—with more than one eye? Pisces’ brows snapped together as he stared at her.\n“Is it strange that other species do not know much about Human reproduction?”\n“Yes! No! I just—”\nErin threw up her hands.\n“Forget it. This is my inn. I’ll get you some food. You can take a seat. Watch out for Pisces, the jerk over there. He steals stuff. Like\nmy food\n.”\nShe glared at the half-eaten pastries on Pisces’ table, and the mage flinched. Then she stomped into the kitchen, leaving him alone with…with…\nAs the adventurer took a table near him, Pisces’ eyes widened as he noticed her armor and sword. Her armor didn’t look magical to him—which had made him certain it\nwasn’t\nher and she was some other Gazer. But that sword…\nA claymore.\nAnd she was sitting there and staring at him…and now Pisces began to sweat.\nThere was no way. There was no way one of the King’s Seven was in this inn.\nStaring at him.\nIf Pisces had been eating food, he would have choked on it. If he’d been drinking, he probably would have sprayed it out his mouth and nose. Since he wasn’t doing either, he just stared, wide-eyed, at Gazi.\nShe smiled at him. And as the last voices of denial tried to obfuscate the truth from his panicking mind, the Named-rank adventurer looked him in the eyes and said the most robe-wetting thing Pisces could imagine.\n“Greetings, [Necromancer].”",

    "text": "Erin rattled around in her kitchen, searching for something to serve up. She put a pot of pasta on the stove, poured out some blue juice—which Pisces had also helped himself to—and sliced up some bread with cheese and sausage. She realized she had no idea what Gazi or her kind ate, but she took it out anyways.\nPisces was sitting in his seat, looking meeker than Erin had ever seen him as he chatted with Gazi. Well, it was more like her asking questions and him replying quickly and nervously. Every few seconds, he would duck his head as if bowing.\nAnother person who recognized the famed adventurer.\n“Here you go.”\nErin put the appetizers in front of Gazi.\n“Let me know if there’s anything you want or can’t eat. Also, this is blue juice. It’s…it’s blue. But it tastes sweet.”\n“This looks delightful. Thank you for allowing me to impose.”\n“No problem. I rarely get visitors—”\nErin stopped as the door opened.\n“I rarely get visitors.”\nShe was expecting the Goblins to enter or perhaps Olesm or even Pawn and some Workers. But instead the last person she expected walked in.\nRelc.\nHe grinned at her and sauntered into the inn, spear over one shoulder. And he wasn’t alone. Four more Drakes—all guardsmen by the look of them—entered the inn, looking around warily.\nErin wasn’t sure what to say. She stared at Relc. The Drake met her eyes and then looked away.\n“Hi, Relc.”\n“Miss Erin. How’re you doing?”\n“Good. Um. You brought friends?”\n“For a meal. Mind putting something on for us? I’m hungry.”\n“Of—of course.”\nFlustered, Erin retreated into the kitchen to double up on her dinner preparations. She reemerged to find Relc and his friends sitting close to Gazi. Since she’d chosen to sit next to Pisces, there was an odd triangle in the center of her inn.\nThere was also dead silence. Awkwardly, Erin put out drinks and appetizers for the guardsmen and Relc. The other Drakes accepted her drinks and stared at the blue juice warily, but they were polite. Relc, on the other hand, was boisterous and noisy, thanking her and gulping down the juice quickly. He looked everywhere—except at her and Gazi, that was.\nThat was Erin’s first clue, but she was so busy running around the inn that she didn’t pick up on it. But as she began draining boiled noodles and mixing it with sautéed onions, she heard Relc get up and walk over to Gazi.\n“So. You’re the famous adventurer entering our small city. Nice to meet you.”\nErin peeked her head out of the kitchen just in time to see Relc leaning over the table. He stuck out one massive hand.\n“I’m Relc. A Senior Guardsman here in Liscor.”\nWas it just her or was Relc…\nbigger\nthan before? But Gazi just smiled up at him and shook his hand with her gauntleted one. She saw the muscles in his arm tense, but Gazi didn’t even blink as she shook his hand.\n“I am Gazi Pathseeker, a travelling adventurer.”\n“Who?”\nHalf the [Guards] looked at Relc, but the Drake pretended not to have any idea who Gazi was. Then he picked at his teeth with a claw.\n“Oh, right. I think I’ve heard the name before. An adventurer? That’s nice. I thought about being one, but it sounded like too much hassle.”\n“The life of an adventurer is not for everyone.”\n“No, there’s all the dirt and mud and monsters trying to kill you.”\n“It becomes occasionally unpleasant.”\n“Right, right.”\nErin didn’t need any special skills to sense the underlying tension in the air. She saw the four guardsmen Relc had brought surreptitiously eying Gazi. Meanwhile, Pisces had scooted around the edge of the table to get away from the two.\nRelc paused. Then he cleared his throat and eyed Gazi.\n“So…mind telling me what you’re doing in\nmy\ncity? And, uh, how long you’re going to be staying around here? Not going to start a war, are you?”\nRelc put a heavy emphasis on\nmy.\nAnd he was leaning over Gazi in a not-so-subtle way. She didn’t seem to be bothered by his looming, though.\n“I am merely exploring this continent. Rest assured, I mean to cause no disruptions while I am here. Reim is far from here, and my liege sleeps.\nI am…peaceful.\n”\nShe said that last part with an edge that made the entire inn go silent. Everyone looked ready to change the subject, especially because Relc’s last comment had gotten on Gazi’s nerves. Her large eye had narrowed ever-so-slightly. However, the big Drake nodded agreeably, or in a way that suggested agreeability while the tone of his voice was anything but.\n“That’s good. I’d hate for any of that. It seems like every other day I have to deal with uppity adventurers causing trouble. It’s because I’m the highest-level member of the Watch, you know. All the guys always call on me for help.”\n“It sounds like you have quite a tough job. I am impressed.”\nGazi’s voice was getting less and less friendly, and the notes of sarcasm…well, let’s just say that Erin was sensing a lot of it in the air. Relc flexed one arm and checked his bicep.\n“Yeah, well, I’m just that good. [Spearmaster], you know? One of Izril’s few.”\n“Indeed? A fascinating class. I myself have killed only a few.”\nThe room became quieter. Relc’s gaze snapped up, and he opened his mouth—but didn’t have a ready retort. Gazi seemed content with that. Relc scratched at his scales. His tail twitched a few times on the floor.\n“Funny person. Anyways. So. What I’m saying is, I’d hate for your visit to get unpleasant, understand? This isn’t a good place for you to cause any trouble like the kind you get up to on your continent. You get—”\nHe was leaning forwards, and Gazi’s main pupil was narrowing to a fine point of annoyance as the [Guards] looked like they were bracing for the worst—which they had come here to\navoid.\nPisces was opening a window and peering outside. The air was turning bad—\nAnd then Erin tapped Relc on the back of the head with a plate full of food. Hard.\n“Ow!”\nHe turned and glared at her. She glared back.\n“Oi. Stop harassing my guest.”\nGazi blinked. Pisces turned back, incredulous, and the Senior Guardsman looked at Erin. He glared—then ducked a second tap of the plate.\n“I wasn’t—”\n“Stop harassing. My guest. And sit back down. The food’s ready.”\nRelc glared, but then he looked at Gazi—and the tense air was lost. He opened his mouth, closed it—stared at Erin, and growled. The Drake stomped back to his table as everyone\nsighed\nin relief. Gazi smiled at Erin, amused.\n“Ah. Pasta? It looks quite delicious. Thank you, Erin.”\n“Yeah, looks good! Have a bite and let me know if that’s an illusion.”\nRelc began digging into his food the instant Erin left it at his table. After some hesitation, the other guardsmen did as well. Their wary expressions changed, and they soon began slurping down the noodles with good humor.\nPisces glanced around. Everyone else was eating—and Erin had even brought out some food for herself. But he was notably bereft of a plate and food.\n“Ah, I believe you missed someone.”\n“Did I?”\nErin eyed him balefully. She quite pointedly stared at the remains of her pastries on his table.\n“Too bad. I guess I only have food for paying customers.”\nHe smirked at her.\n“As a matter of fact, I believe today is the day I will pay off my tab. I have come into quite a bit of money as of late.”\n“Really?”\nErin raised a skeptical eyebrow. Pisces pulled out a bulging pouch and showed her the contents.\n“If you would observe.”\nShe stared.\n“That’s a\nlot\nof gold. Hey! Did you steal that?”\nRelc’s head rose, but Pisces looked insulted.\n“Not at all. I merely performed a complex bit of magic and received remuneration. But I believe this is more than enough to pay off my tab many times over. Allow me to repay my debts in full and tip you for your time.”\nHe reached a hand into the pouch, but before he could take any gold out, the bag disappeared from underneath his hand. Relc pulled it away and deposited the bag on his table.\n“Yoink.”\n“Hey!”\nPisces shot to his feet. He grabbed for the money, but Relc raised the bag out of arm’s reach.\n“Give that back! It is my property!”\n“Nope! Confiscated by the City Watch!”\n“Relc!”\nErin shouted at the Drake as Pisces grew redder and redder. The mage pointed a trembling finger at Relc.\n“This is an abuse of authority! You have no right to steal my property—”\nRelc grinned and waggled a claw at Pisces.\n“I have every right. Or did you forget—you’re still wanted for all those thefts you did earlier. Scaring people—robbing graves—all of that should be nicely covered by this donation to the city, shouldn’t it?”\nPisces turned white and then red again with outrage. He spluttered, but didn’t really have anything to respond with except unrighteous indignation. Relc laughed at the mage—until Erin punched him in the shoulder.\n“Ow. Have you gotten stronger?”\n“It’s a Skill. Stop bothering my customers.”\n“Fine. But I’m keeping this. Necromancer Pisces will be allowed back in the city, and we won’t stab him with all his fines paid off—but I’ll be watching him.”\n“This is unjust—not right—”\nPisces clenched his fists, but Erin managed to get him back to his seat. He sat there in a huff, so she got him his own plate and food to calm him down.\n“Honestly. I have a new guest here. Can’t you two behave for one night?”\n“I am quite enjoying the spectacle. Do not mind me.”\nRelc glanced sideways at Gazi. But then he ignored her and grinned at Erin.\n“Sorry, Erin. I just wanted to say hi—after so long.”\nShe eyed him doubtfully.\n“Really?”\n“Really. I saw you just this morning and thought—well, it would be nice to see a friendly Human again. I had to deal with so many rude adventuring types and annoying mages each day.”\nPisces muttered something darkly. Erin shot him a look, and he shut up.\n“I saw that. You were pretty impressive out there. I didn’t know you were that good.”\nRelc grinned and put his hands behind his head as he leaned back in his chair.\n“I try, I try. I’m not the greatest guardsman in the city for no reason.”\nThe four guardsmen stopped their meal and looked up at Relc. One of them snorted.\n“Greatest guardsman? Sure, one who can’t even catch a Human Runner.”\nThe other three chuckled. Relc thumped back down on his chair and glared at them.\n“I was wearing\narmor\n, and I had my spear, alright? She got lucky!”\nErin blinked at Relc as the other guardsmen made more jokes at his expense.\n“You got outrun by a Runner?”\n“She was really fast! I’ve never seen anything like it! Any other Runner I’d leave in the dust. But her—”\n“Sure you didn’t lose while you were admiring her? Relc, the Gecko, lost to a mere Human. The mighty have fallen.”\n“Too busy panting and not enough breathing while you were running?”\n“Shut up!\nDon’t call me that stupid name!\n”\nRelc glared at the two guards and threw a bit of food at them. That earned him another buffet from Erin. He glared at her, but then switched tone.\n“—By the way, Miss Erin. You…wouldn’t happen to know any female Runners, would you?”\n“Me?”\nErin blinked at him. Relc nodded.\n“Sure, I mean, maybe, right? She was about your age.”\n“What did she look like?”\nThis question came from Pisces. The mage was staring with some interest at Relc. The Drake frowned and shrugged awkwardly.\n“She had…black hair. And she was—tall? Taller than Erin. And, uh, she was fast. Ring any bells?”\nPisces and Erin exchanged a look. Erin planted her hands on her hips.\n“How am I supposed to know someone by all that?”\n“Hey, I’m doing the best I can! All you Humans—you’re sort of similar. Anyways, I just thought you’d know her.”\n“Because I’m Human? And all Humans know other Humans?”\nRelc scratched at the side of his head.\n“Um. Yeah?”\n“Unbelievable.”\nErin began banging together empty dishes as she glared at Relc, and the Drake spread his claws out innocently.\n“Hey, I just wondered—that isn’t the only reason I’m here! I was going to tell you about the thief in the city.”\n“I already\nknow\nabout the thief in the city! And before you cause more trouble, it wasn’t Pisces. If he were the thief, you’d have caught him already.”\n“Oh, we know that. The [Guards] would have spotted him entering the city, his stupid invisible trick or not. No, it’s probably just some Human. But I wanted to tell you to hire some protection around here. You got lucky with those Shield Spiders, but you’re not going to be lucky forever. Hire an adventurer already.”\n“And pay them with what? Adventurers are expensive!”\nOne of the guards nodded.\n“They are. Unless you know one personally, the rates they charge are far too high.”\nRelc glared at the guardsman.\n“Way to help, thick-tail.”\n“I don’t have money for that. Unless—”\nErin reappeared in the common room. She smiled at Gazi, who was observing the argument with urbane amusement.\n“Hey, Gazi, want a job? I can’t pay much, but I’ll feed you if you stay. I haven’t fixed up the rooms upstairs, but I could work on that.”\nRelc, Pisces, and all four guardsmen started choking on their food. Gazi smiled and shook her head.\n“As tempting as your offer is, I must refuse. But I believe you would be wise to invest in some form of defense as you are no warrior.”\n“Once I have the money from the Shield Spiders I’ll see. But I’m not made of coins. I don’t have much gold.”\nPisces had been following the conversation while eating a huge helping of pasta. Now, a calculating look appeared on his face as he glanced at Erin.\n“I might be able to help in that regard. Miss Erin, seeing as how my funds have been confiscated…would you accept—alternate forms of payment?”\nShe glared at him.\n“At this point, as long as you pay me\nsomething\nI’ll be happy.”\nErin paused and hastily amended that sentence.\n“But nothing icky. Or gross. Or—anything I won’t like.”\nPisces was still glaring daggers at Relc, but his eyes had lit up at Erin’s request, and he developed a knowing smile as he tapped two fingers together thoughtfully.\n“I believe I have something in mind that may benefit us both.”\nFor some reason, that struck her as ominous—and she hoped Pisces wouldn’t cause much trouble. It was practically a given he’d cause some. Erin shook her head.\n“If we’re done with talking about stuff I can’t afford—anyone hungry for something else? I have Acid Flies if you guardsmen want to try them. I know Relc eats them.”\nThe guardsmen exchanged a glance while Relc patted his stomach and tried to decide whether he was still hungry. Pisces hurriedly waved away the bowl Erin was offering.\nGazi raised her single eyebrow.\n“Acid Flies?”",

Unlike Erin, however, she was not immediately in possession of either.\nShe skulked in an alleyway, not trying to keep out of sight, but refusing to go out into the street. She wouldn’t be bothered even if she did. Some guardsmen were looking out for thieves, but they would never suspect her. Her attire, and more importantly, her bearing would immediately allay any suspicions to her guilt.\nIt was a shame and a disgrace, then, that she was forced to stoop to such demeaning lengths to survive. Theft was not befitting of her station, but the greedy merchants and shopkeepers were practically inviting her to take their goods. Besides, she had no coin to pay—not that she would in any case.\nWhat was hers was hers. What was theirs was hers too, for that matter.\nShe’d made a mistake in travelling south. The city she wanted to travel to was Celum—not this—wherever here was. But the foolish caravanner had erred in giving her directions—she certainly hadn’t made a mistake! Now she was stranded and forced to even further depths to survive.\nThe girl’s stomach grumbled. She’d snatched some fruit earlier today, but the shopkeepers were on more of a lookout after a few days of her pilfering. She’d have to wait until late that night before she would be able to eat.\nSoon. The girl licked her fingers and eyed the streets packed with hideous dog creatures and evil lizards. She just had to obtain enough coin, and then she would be away from this city filled with monsters. She just had to find Magnolia Reinhart, and then she would be welcomed with dignity befitting her rank and station.\nSoon.\nThe girl’s stomach growled.\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "Running is a peculiar thing. And it’s one of the few things I’m qualified to talk about in any world. For me, running is as close to living as anything I do. I’ve studied it, practiced it, and made it mine. I can’t claim anything else like that.\nBut if running is pure, life is not. My body is not, for that matter.\nFunny thing. Apparently, doing a record-breaking, thirty-mile marathon at my top speed has consequences, especially on a leg that just got healed. Suffice it to say that when the Horns of Hammerad caught up with me, they had to let me ride on the cart most of the way back to Celum.\nLying down in the middle of a field during a complete physical shutdown is actually pretty relaxing. I was so tired I didn’t even think about what would happen if a monster found me.*\n*Not that it’s hard to think about. Apparently, the most common type of monster between the Human cities and Liscor are Goblins or a variety of avian species. I’m told that it would be far better to have the birds start eating me alive than suffer what male Goblins do to women. Next time I see one of those buggers, I’m kicking his head in.\nAnyways, I’m just lucky that one of their team members, Hunt, had an appropriate tracking Skill or something. The Horns figured out what happened pretty quick when I stopped moving. Again, running a marathon on a light meal isn’t a good idea. I’ve tried ultra-marathons, and the key to those runs isn’t speed or even that much practice. All you do is take it easy and eat the entire way through. My kind of fun.\nWhere was I? Oh yeah. Running. Running is simple, but nothing else is in life. Even jobs involving running are way too difficult.\nCase in point and why I’m still standing outside the Runner’s Guild rather than going in. I really don’t want to have to deal with the people inside—or anyone right now. In fact, the only thing keeping me remotely sane is the fact that my leg is better.\nMy leg is better.\nFour words, but it is all the difference in the world to me. From thinking I’d never run again to being able to run wherever I go?\nLife is good.\n—Unless of course you’re an out-of-work bum with no money who has to borrow from other people to survive. Dad always warned me this would happen if I didn’t shape up.*\n*Of course, shaping up for him would be going into politics to kiss ass and tell lies 24/7, so he can go jump off a cliff.\nI am quite literally penniless. Without the Horns of Hammerad, I wouldn’t even have been sleeping in the inn for the last few days, let alone eating. The reason for that is twofold. One—and again, this is my fault—I had to rest up from the stupid marathon I ran right after getting my leg healed. Even with a potion, there was still some rehabilitation necessary. That took two days before Ceria told me I was fine.\nThe other reason?\nPeople.\nEvery head in the Runner’s Guild turns as I kick open the door. Just as quickly, most of the Runners look away.* Looks like half of the regular City Runners are here, plus a few people I recognize.\n*It’s a great look, too. It says that they were clearly expecting someone, anyone besides me, but I’m here now, and they have to put up with me—mainly by pretending I don’t exist. Gods. This is why I hate looking at people’s faces.\nFals is talking to Garia next to the receptionist’s desk. Both notice me, but Fals keeps talking and Garia’s too moonstruck to interrupt him. And watching Fals from a corner of the room with her posse is another charming person of interest.\nPersua.\nPersua, Persua, Persua. Oh, how the mighty have fallen. If I didn’t know what Magnolia had told me, I still would have been able to tell something was wrong.\nShe’s still there, and Toriska’s sitting next to her—Claudeil might be around—but they look like they just were at a funeral. Persua’s sycophants aren’t here—all the Street Runners are normally missing—and she looked like she’s mad enough to cry.\nOr run someone over with a wagon. But guess what? She’s not a City Runner anymore. In fact, I daresay Toriska’s look of wanting to throw up can only get better by the slack-jawed look of horror as I walk in.\nSchadenfreude—a German word for enjoying the suffering of someone else—is my favorite thing right now.\nWhen Persua sees me, I think she might actually faint. Her face doesn’t exactly have much color, but it drains of everything. She sways, actually\nsways\nin her seat, then begins to get up. But Toriska grabs her, and she hesitates—because I’m looking at her.\nOne move. One smart comment. Come over here and I’ll drop-kick you into a wall, Persua.\nAm I going to go after her? I haven’t decided. I want to—and Persua looks for the door as she sees the look on my face. I hesitate—\nI’ve still got to research what the punishment is for murder in this world. For now, I walk past her, just savoring her look of pure hatred.\nThe old Guildmaster is gone, but I never really knew his face. He’s not in the Guild, so I’m mostly focused on the front desk.\nFals and Garia are in front of me in line while the female receptionist deals with a kid trying to turn in a delivery. I normally don’t like to talk to Fals, but I am in the best of moods today. Besides, their conversation sounds interesting, so I put up with Fals long enough to listen in.\nGaria sounds pretty upset. Both Runners are talking about something. Oh, right, that unmarked request she showed me two weeks ago. Seems like ages, now.\n“…Third Runner we’ve lost so far. Pestrom.”\n“What? No. He was an experienced City Runner—Level 19! I—I saw him just the other week. I thought you said no one went—”\n“I didn’t know he was going. He talked about it, and I thought I talked him out of it. I guess he wanted to go in secret. We wouldn’t have known what happened if that [Shepherd] didn’t find his pack. Damn it. The Guild\nhas\nto take down that request.”\nFals shakes his head. He looks genuinely angry and frustrated, but I’ve seen people wear perfect masks of emotion. Garia bites her lip.\n“But he had an enchanted shortsword. He wasn’t an adventurer, and I know that’s not high-level compared to a Courier, not by half—”\nHe breaks in harshly, more agitated than I’ve heard him.\n“None of that matters in the High Passes, Garia. The monsters there—you’d need fighting skills or insanely high levels—something above Level 30 probably to get out unscathed. I\ntold\nPestrom that when he brought it up and he told me…I guess he didn’t take me seriously.”\n“You’ve got to do something about it, Fals. The reward’s gone up to\neighty gold\n. Eighty! A bunch of the new Street Runners—they know it’s dangerous. But for that kind of money…”\nFals nods seriously. The Runner ahead of him is done, so he steps up to the counter and addresses the receptionist. Isn’t she the one I know?\n“Stenei, don’t let any Runners take that open request. Spread the word to the other Guilds. Anyone who tries to take the High Passes request\nwill\ndie. We need it off the requests board.”\nThe receptionist—Stenei, that’s the one who often gives me deliveries—looks distressed. She clearly wants to help Fals out, and she doesn’t notice me as she replies.\n“We can’t take it down, Fals. You know guild policy. Even with the new Guildmaster—it’s still a request.”\nFals nods. He leans over the counter and smiles charmingly* at the receptionist.**\n*I assume it’s a charming smile. The problem is, I’ve seen so many charming smiles that this particular type of charm makes me want to break something every time I see it.\n**Why are they always female? Oh, right. Feminism isn’t dead in this world; it probably never existed to begin with. Unless you count someone like Lady Magnolia, and she’s probably a rare exception due to her influence and wealth. Lovely.\n“I know. But you could, ah,\nsuggest\nto other Runners not to take the request, right? Believe me, it would save lives.”\n“We already do that. I’m sorry about Pestrom, I really am.”\nThe receptionist and Garia both blush when Fals smiles, which only ticks me off more. Fals considers this.\n“Then…what if this request just\nhappened\nto be hidden below other ones on all the boards in the other guilds? It happens. Organization can be bad. It’s not against any rules, is it?”\nShe hesitates, then nods.\n“I could ask about that. Let me just pen a [Message]…I think you’re right, Fals.”\n“In that case, Garia and I will tell the other Runners to spread the word and let everyone know what happened to Pestrom. Thanks, Stenei, you’re a lifesaver. Literally.”\nFals smiles at her again. She blushes and starts fiddling with the delivery Seals on her counter.\n“There’s no need for flattery, Fals. Anyways, don’t you have a lot of work to do?”\n“I always have time to chat with a lovely lady. How’re the kids? Are you—”\nOkay, interesting discussion I can deal with, but flirting/chitchat I’m not waiting around for. I don’t quite elbow Fals out of the way* as I step forwards.\n*I don’t. Really. But I might have stepped a bit on his foot.\n“Hey. Got a request for me?”\n“\nRyoka! You’re on your feet!\n”\nGaria’s exclamation is so loud that anyone not looking at me already—I wince, but she sweeps me up in the biggest hug I can.\n“Garia, put me down—\nGaria!\n”\nTo my huge annoyance, Fals joins in. Which makes Garia let me go—but he gives me a squeeze.\n“\nRyoka.\nIt’s so great to see you! Your legs are healed—that’s incredible! That’s impossible!”\n“Did Magnolia Reinhart do it like she said? She’s so generous!”\n“Totally unlike the rest of her family, no matter what they say about her.”\nFals agrees. I have to actually put a hand on his shoulder and move him back. I think he’s trying to cop a feel.\n“You done?”\nHe blinks, steps back, and flashes me a huge smile which goes unreturned.\n“Sorry—I’m just so glad you’re well. Where did you go? Tenbault?”\n“No, Liscor.”\n“\nLiscor?\n”\n“It’s a long story. I had help from some adventurers, not the Healer of Tenbault. They fixed me up.”\n“Wh—really? There’s a high-level [Healer] in Liscor?”\n“Something like that. Anyways, I just got back. Any interesting running requests around?”\nGaria still looks delighted, and I have to admit, she was there for me.\n“Ryoka, this is\nso great.\nYou have to tell me what happened! Let’s get a drink—or visit my home! I mean—\nyou’re well!\nAnd guess what happened to Persua and the Guildmaster?”\nFals hesitates and gives me the side-eye as I try not to smirk.\n“Oh, yeah. Did you hear about that, Ryoka?”\n“I may have. Persua’s a Street Runner now? Oh, that’s\nterrible.\nWhat happened? Did she get her just desserts? Or did someone realize she’s nowhere near a City Runner’s level?”\nOut of the corner of my eye, I can see Persua freeze up and then turn redder with every word. Fals gives me a cautious look as Garia looks delighted—nervous, but I can see other City Runners snorting.\nThat’s right, everyone knows she did it and she’s being punished.\n“\nSo you did know what happened.\n”\nFals looks at me cautiously, and I give him a bland smile. Maybe he knows Magnolia’s to blame, but I didn’t make her do anything.\n“I heard it on the way here. What, is it a problem? Us runners have to stick together, so if Persua needs some guidance—I’m sure I can give her tips.”\n“Nah, Ryoka. I think it’s all sorted, right?”\nFals looks at Garia and the receptionist for support, but he doesn’t get more than a nod from the receptionist. Garia frowns—and I turn away from him and his shallow politics.\nI plant my hands on the desk.\n“Hey. I’m back.”\n“Miss Ryoka! It’s wonderful to see you on your feet.”\nStenei smiles, and I hesitate. Wow. That’s a good act if it is one. I cough, embarrassed.\n“Thanks…uh, Stenei, right?”\n“Correct! How can I help you?”\n“Um—contracts. Any big ones for City Runners? Or me specifically?”\nI’ve heard that popular City Runners get special orders for just them, which is a sign they’ve made it. I’m mostly asking about emergency runs for adventurers, and I’m curious about what Fals and Garia were talking about.\nEighty gold coins?\nThat’s a fortune! Is that related to…\n“Actually, Miss Griffin, we have\nseveral\nopen contracts for you.”\n“Wh—really?”\nFals and Garia turn instantly. I blink in gratification—but it becomes a scowl as Stenei reads them out.\n“They’re all for Lady Reinhart, and they list you as the only Runner. If you’d like to take a look.”\n“Pass.”\nStenei looks astonished, and Fals’ mouth falls open.\n“But Miss Griffin, these are urgent, and the Guild—”\n“I don’t want a delivery for Magnolia Reinhart. Anything else for me not from her? No? Okay, I guess it’s regular deliveries, then.”\nI shake my head. Stenei is trying to offer me the files she has.\n“But Miss Griffin, it’s very,\nvery\nlucrative and not that difficult—”\nBut I don’t want to talk to Lady Reinhart.\nYes, she helped me, but she made me one of those offers I couldn’t refuse, and I did refuse it. She knows I’m from…somewhere else, and she scares the crap out of me, if I’m honest.\nShe’s dangerous, and I don’t want to talk to her, so I walk over to the cork board with the requests.\n“Nevermind that. I’ll just take this one to Remendia and—”\n“Miss Griffin, I am\nso\nsorry, but the Guild would like you to take Magnolia’s requests. Before you take another one.”\nI stop, one of the pieces of parchment in hand. Stenei is standing there, and she looks uncomfortable as she shakes her head at me. I try to place the request on the counter. She doesn’t look at it.\n“What’re you talking about? This one is open. I’m free. Put me down.”\n“I can’t do that, Miss Griffin. The Guildmaster has orders—and the other Guilds do too. Here’s a quick delivery to Lady Reinhart. Sugar from the north. You can pick it up right in the city.”\nShe offers me a slip, and I look at it. Then push it back.\n“No. Put me down for…”\nThen I see the look in her eyes and realize I’m not arguing with her. All at once, my good mood fades. I look at Garia, who’s confused, and Fals, who’s staring at me as if he’s figuring something out. But I?\nI just looked at the Runner’s Guild, and all my goodwill towards Magnolia fades away as I realize I’ve just been hit with the other side of her power and influence.\nI have to deliver something to her?\nI look at the [Receptionist] and realize she’s telling the truth.\nI am totally conscious of my empty money pouch. So that’s what her game is? She must have the entire Guild—is the entire\nnetwork\nof Guilds under her thumb? And if she does, then how do I earn money?\n“Miss Griffin? It’s not hard to do it. Just one quick delivery and I’m sure we’ll be allowed to give you all the ones you want.”\nI stare at Stenei. Slowly, I look down at the request earmarked for me, and I can see Magnolia just waiting at her door. To invite me in. There’s no one\npushing\nme into doing this. Magnolia never forced me to do anything…but pressure? I can feel it all over, and you know what?\nI hate being pushed.\nSo I push the paper back and step back. Instead of my smile, I’m scowling as I walk away from the desk.\n“Yeah, I’m sure. Forget about it. I’ll try another Guild.”",

    "text": "Celum Runner’s Guild was the one I was just at. It’s not far to other cities—well, it is to run for no pay, but if you’re pissed and still enjoying running, like me, it’s not too far to spite a [Lady].\nOf course, she probably has the power to make Ocre and Remendia not listen, so I’ll go to Wales the next day. It turns out ‘no money’ doesn’t cover a few silver coins in my pack. Enough for a crappy room, and if I eat from my stale rations, that’s breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\nWales is\nway\nfar away from Remendia and Ocre. Fifty miles. She can’t…\nThe [Receptionist] at the desk knows me before I get to him, and he makes the other City Runners step back and offers me the only request he has—take a bunch of letters to Magnolia—\nEvery Guild I try is the same. I even try to pretend I’m not Ryoka, but it’s hard to change skin-tone and my height. Every single [Receptionist] has the same reply, and I’m about to kill everything.\nNo requests. No deliveries, and no pay. That’s the message I’ve gotten every day since I got back. I tried Runner’s Guilds in three of the cities around here, and all of them are doing the same thing.\nIn fact, they’re even making it so I can’t even go behind the Guild’s back and do unofficial work. Someone—and I bet it’s Magnolia—has decided to make the Runner’s Guild fulfill\nevery\nrequest the moment it comes in. Even if it means they have to work every other Runner around the clock to get it done.\nBy the time I get back to Celum, it’s just to see how long they can keep this up. Half of the Street and City Runners in here are practically dead on their feet, but they’re still doing it. And it looks like they’ve called in the better City Runners like Fals to help out.\nIn short, I’m being shut out until I give into their demands. Which I won’t do. What they actually want isn’t hard—\nBut I’m not doing it. I don’t give in to bullies and peer pressure. And the innocent look the receptionist is giving me makes me want to punch her lights out.\nScrew this. It’s time to get unpleasant.",

    "text": "When Ryoka Griffin came back to the Runner’s Guild, Stenei was still on duty. This time—Garia felt for her.\nShe was a nice woman and had really been upset when Persua got away scott-free. But Ryoka was so furious that it was written on her face.\nGaria understood why and was just glad Persua wasn’t here today. Apparently, she was still running as a Street Runner—and furious—but she, Claudeil, and Toriska were in trouble, and everyone knew it.\nThe problem was—Ryoka seemed to be in trouble too. She stomped her way towards the counter, and she looked both hungry and tired. Garia had offered to let her stay at her parent’s farm—they lived just outside of Celum—but Ryoka had told her she didn’t want charity.\nGaria watched Ryoka and sensed trouble. She didn’t have any particular skills like [Dangersense], but she didn’t need to. She\nknew\nRyoka, not just as a friend but as a meteorologist knows weather. And if Ryoka were a storm, then she’d be a shipbreaking hurricane with lightning and hail thrown in for good measure.\nThe tall, barefoot girl leaned over the counter and glared at the receptionist. Garia felt for the older woman. Stenei was nice and helpful to everyone—she was just doing her job, even if Garia herself didn’t agree with it. It wasn’t her fault.\nThen again, Garia wouldn’t have wished Ryoka on anyone when she was this angry. Maybe Persua. Ryoka’s bright green eyes flashed with annoyance.\n“It’s been\nfour days\n.”\nRyoka leaned over the counter and glared at the wilting receptionist.\n“And you’re telling me that there are\nno requests?\nExcept of course for Magnolia.”\nStenei opened her mouth, hesitated, and cast an imploring glance around the room. And who should be there except for…\nThis time, Garia wondered if someone had told him to be here. Because he just\nhappened\nto have run in ten minutes before Ryoka, and that was despite doing seven deliveries in the last four days. He looked as tired as everyone else, but Fals stepped forwards and smiled at Ryoka in a way that made Garia’s heart beat faster. Ryoka turned her glare on him.\n“We don’t want to get in your way, Ryoka—”\n“Oh really? Then stop taking all the delivery requests.”\nFals scratched the back of his neck and smiled again awkwardly.\n“We’d love to. Really. But Ryoka, it would be best if you took one of Magnolia’s requests first.”\nRyoka knew why, but she wasn’t in the mood to be helpful. She crossed her arms over her chest.\n“Why?”\nAnother smile, slightly strained.\n“Lady Magnolia’s refusing to take any other requests until you deliver something in person. That’s hurting Runners in every city around here.”\n“So? Just do the deliveries yourself. She’ll take them if I don’t deliver anything.”\n“We’d like to, really we would, Ryoka. But Lady Magnolia—no one tells her what to do, Ryoka. Take a look at her requests, won’t you? It wouldn’t even be that hard.”\nFrom what Garia knew of Ryoka, an easy delivery would be even less attractive to her. But as Stenei held out one of the requests, Ryoka grudgingly stared at it. She curled her lip as she read the requests one after another.\n“Hot peppers? Cabbages? She could get that in any market.”\n“But she\nwants\na Runner. You, specifically.”\n“So until she gets one, I won’t get any other jobs, is that it? And I’m supposed to ask her to let other Runners take her requests, right?”\n“We wouldn’t say that.”\n“Oh?”\nFals seemed to choose his words carefully.\n“If you’d—\nsuggest\nto Lady Magnolia that she open up her delivery requests for every Runner, things would be—smoother.”\n“Right. And you all get paid so everyone’s happy?”\nRyoka turned from Fals and stared around the guild. Street Runners and City Runners returned her stare countless times over. They were all silently watching Ryoka, and not with friendly expressions either.\n“So until then, you’re all going to keep taking the requests.”\nFals shrugged ruefully as if caught out in a prank.\n“We’re just doing our jobs, Ryoka. But you’re right. We’re working together on this, Runners and the Guild.”\n“I don’t like being pressured. By anyone.”\nFals put a hand on Ryoka’s shoulder, making the other Runner instantly tense up. He flashed her a reassuring smile that made Garia’s stomach do flip flops.\n“Ryoka, I completely agree with you. But please, look at it from the perspective of the rest of us Runners.”\nHe gestured to the other Runners.\n“We’re a team. Okay, sure we don’t all get along, but if every Runner was out for themselves, it’d be a mess. We work together to tackle hard assignments, and we share the wealth so everyone gets ahead.”\nHe tapped his chest lightly.\n“We’re\nRunners\n. We might charge high prices, but we get the job done! And if some people don’t like that, it’s because they don’t understand how tough our jobs really are. We risk life and limb to help others.”\nThe other Runners in the room warmed to Fals’ speech. They murmured agreement as he continued.\n“So if we work together—if we help support each other—we’ll survive. Hundreds of Runners die every year, but the Guilds around here lost the least amount of Runners each year. We don’t take dangerous requests, and we team up if one of us is in danger. Sure, we might not earn as much as other Runners, but we know we can count on each other.”\nRyoka stared at Fals as the other Runners in the room cheered. Then, calmly and deliberately, she grabbed his wrist and plucked his hand off her shoulder.\n“Nice speech. But you’re full of shit.”\nGaria stopped smiling. The mood in the room froze over in a second. Ryoka stared around at the other Runners, unflinching. She looked back at Fals, who was staring at her uncertainty. Then she shook her head.\n“You want to talk about Runners and preach about playing nice and sticking together? Fine. But leave me out of your little party.”\nShe pointed a thumb at her chest.\n“I’m a\nbarefoot\nrunner\n. If I cared about what people thought, I wouldn’t run at all. Runners run. We deliver stuff. It’s a job, not a calling.”\nShe looked around again, and this time, she caught Garia’s eye for a moment.\n“I couldn’t care less whether or not you lot like me. All I’m here to do is deliver stuff and get paid. I don’t want Magnolia’s stupid requests. If you lot want to earn favor with her, deal with it and leave me out of it. You should\nwant\nme to not work with her. You think I’m trying to be her special, personal Runner?”\nFals spread his hands out helplessly.\n“We’d like to believe you, Ryoka, but—”\n“You think I’m lying?”\nThe\nedge\nin Ryoka’s voice made Fals hesitate. She took one step forwards, and he took one step back.\n“I don’t lie. And I hate liars. When you make a promise, you keep it. When you speak, you look someone in the eye and mean every word. When I say I’ll do something, I\nmean\nit. If you want to do deliveries to Magnolia, take the damn requests. I don’t care about your politics.”\nShe poked Fals in the chest hard enough to make him take another step back.\n“But if you get in my way, I’ll kick your face in.”\nFals opened his mouth, but this time, Garia grabbed him and pulled him away. Ryoka turned and glared around the room. None of the other Runners were willing to meet her eyes, but the feeling they gave off—\nShe stalked over to the request board and glared at it. Countless requests were listed, and not a one was for her.\nThere was no point to taking any of the requests, she knew. Even if she took one to the counter, it would be ‘miraculously’ already taken by another Runner. Or they’d refuse to recognize her effort or just not hand over the item she had to deliver. Even if she did the delivery, the funds were already deposited in the Guild, and they wouldn’t be released until Magnolia said so.\nBut—she had a thought. Wasn’t there one delivery that promised payment upon just\ngetting\nto the person? One that no Runner could take. Should take.\nSlowly, she investigated the board, removing requests and tossing them to the floor. The receptionist looked upset, but Ryoka dared her to object. She was looking for something…\naha\n, just like Fals had asked. Right on the bottom.\nRyoka pushed back several requests and selected one at the bottom. She brought it back to the counter and handed it to the receptionist.\n“This one. I’ll take the request for the High Passes.”\n“What?”\nStenei blinked at Ryoka. She stammered.\n“That one’s—but you can’t—”\n“Not a good idea, Ryoka.”\nFals pulled himself gently away from Garia and moved in front of Ryoka again. His face was concerned.\n“The High Passes aren’t a place for Runners or even most adventurers. Whoever put that request in doesn’t know what they’re doing. You shouldn’t take it.”\n“Why not? There’s nothing else for me to do.”\nRyoka snatched the piece of paper back from Fals. Then she grinned.\n“Unless you want to do it? I’ll follow you out to make sure you get it done.”\nRyoka smiled maliciously at Fals. He recoiled visibly, and she nodded.\n“That’s what I thought. I’m doing the request.”\n“You’ll die!”\nGaria broke into the conversation. She flushed as all eyes turned on her, but she continued desperately.\n“Ryoka, Fals is right. This is serious. Just take one of Magnolia’s requests! The High Passes—”\n“I’ll survive. And I’ll complete the request even if it’s dangerous—not just for money. Apparently, that’s all Runners think about.”\nRyoka pushed Fals back and moved past Garia. She walked towards the door and stopped as another not quite barred her way. Persua.\nShe didn’t have her posse anymore, just Toriska and Claudeil. Both glared at Ryoka—but moved back as Ryoka’s hand curled into a fist.\n“\nPersua.\nWhat’re you doing here? Don’t cause a scene.”\nFals raised his voice warningly, and Persua shot him a murderous look—but even the [Receptionist] was giving her a stare. She was red-faced, furious with humiliation, and, Ryoka thought, pinched for coin much in the same way Ryoka was.\nThe two were giving off sparks of hatred as they looked at each other, but Persua just tossed her head defiantly, ignoring Fals’ warning. Ryoka growled.\n“Are you going to try and stop me too? Hi, Persua. I’d love for you to try.”\nShe looked at Toriska, and the girl shifted, a hand on her knife, but Ryoka was ready to punch. Persua’s look clearly said that she would like nothing better than to stop Ryoka, very painfully if possible…but she was standing behind Claudeil. She tossed her head as if her hair were a whip she meant to strike Ryoka with and sneered at her.\n“\nI\ndon’t need to do anything. You’re going to die in the High Passes.”\n“Oh really?”\nPersua’s tone dripped venom as she stared at the request Ryoka held. Contemptuously.\n“Why do you think none of the experienced Runners take those kinds of requests?\nWe’re\nsmart enough not to risk our lives.\nWe\nwork together, not like you. You’ll die alone because you’re a fool.”\nRyoka nodded.\n“You’re probably right.”\nPersua blinked in surprise. Fals and Garia both stared at Ryoka along with the other Runners. Ryoka nodded and looked around the room again.\n“If I do it your way, I probably would live long enough to retire. And maybe I’d even earn a lot of money, who knows? And if I kiss your ass long enough, maybe you’d even like me. If I were like the rest of you, I’d never take this request.”\nShe paused. Then she stared right back at Fals as she delivered her next line.\n“Too bad I’m not a coward.”\nRyoka turned and walked out of the guild even as the stunned silence turned into shouts of fury.",

    "text": "I burn bridges as I breathe. It’s a talent. I’ve done it all my life, and I guess some things you just can’t change. Me and my big mouth. I got kicked out of one school for telling the principal what I really thought about him and the other—\nThey’re pissed. I can hear them yelling as I open the door. But I’m still smiling as I walk out the building.\nOne thing matters. One thing I cling to even in my darkest days. And that thing is integrity.\nI am that I am. I am who I am. And I will not change for anyone except myself. Countries and cultures have their own laws. Society pushes and prods. Everyone has an agenda, and no motive is honest.\nBut I will bow to no one, especially not petty tyrants and liars like Fals. So I smile even as I sever ties. It may be that after this I’ll have to go elsewhere. Actually, not ‘may.’ Probably I’ll have to go or else have both legs broken this time.\nHow far does this group of Runners’ influence stretch? Well, no matter where I go, they’ll probably follow with rumor and lies. And it will be the same wherever I go.\nWhat a crappy, small group of people. But what a wonderful world. If I need to, I’ll run to the very edges of it to find a place to be free.\nIf only everyone weren’t so petty. Well, those that aren’t are like Fals, and he’s worthless in his own way. But one of them—\n“Ryoka—”\nCrap. Garia’s the only person in that group worth a grain of salt. In her case, she’s probably worth a small mountain of salt. A hill, at least.\nShe jogs to catch up. Part of me wants to just keep walking and lose her, but even I’m not enough of a jerk to do that. Besides, she’s helped me so much that I owe her.\nGaria hesitates as she slows to keep pace with me. I’m expecting her to defend the other Runners, but what she says next surprises me.\n“I’ll keep them off your backs if I can. But they’re angry. Really,\nreally\nangry.”\nHuh. But maybe I should have expected that? Garia’s a stand-up kind of girl. That’s why I like her.\n“They’re pissed off because I told them what I thought of their little cult?”\nGaria hesitates.\n“I didn’t—I don’t agree with everything Fals said, Ryoka, but I think he’s right in some ways. I think you’re right too, though. But you’re special. You—you can do deliveries by yourself, but some of us\nneed\nto work together. Without the way the Guild does things, we’d get hurt way more often.”\n“So we work together and drag everyone down who doesn’t agree with us, is that it?”\n“I didn’t say it was perfect.”\n“Pack mentality. And Fals thinks he knows everything. Are we dogs or gods?”\nI thought that was clever. Or maybe it was stupid. Ouch. Garia’s look makes me feel like a complete jackass.\n“We’re neither. We’re just people, Ryoka. And they’re not perfect, I know. But we can’t all be like you. Some of us have to work together to survive.”\n…Damn it. This is getting painful.\n“I’d like to be able to run like you. But I can’t. I’m too slow—I can only carry really heavy stuff instead of fast requests. If it weren’t for the way the Guild works, I wouldn’t be able to run.”\n“…I know. But I won’t answer to them.”\nGaria nods and then visibly braces herself. Here comes her pitch.\n“Couldn’t you—couldn’t you just talk to Magnolia? Would it be that hard to just ask her…?”\nIn some ways? No. In some ways…\n“In some ways, no. But in some ways, yeah. I’m not doing it either way.”\n“I thought you’d say that. I told Fals you would.”\nThat bastard. He\nasked\nGaria to go after me. That manipulative—\n“When are you going to go?”\n“Now. Fals and the other Runners will probably try to stop me if I don’t. I know Persua will.”\n“Okay, okay.”\nSuddenly, Garia seizes me in a bear hug. And she’s—\nstrong\n. Seriously, I think she’s going to break a rib. But then she pushes me back.\n“Go. I’ll try and keep them busy for a little bit. And don’t die, okay?”\nShe turns and runs away. Slowly, by City Runner standards. Her posture really is quite bad. But she’s got heart, and that makes her the best Runner of the lot in my opinion.\nOkay. Okay, that was—surprising or gratifying? Both. Also a bit humbling. But that’s right. I’ve gotta go.\nBody check. I’m all in one piece, and I’ve got no injuries. Plus, since I haven’t been running any deliveries—I’ll call it at least 92% readiness. Perfect.\nMotivation on the other hand—60%. Not good, not bad*. I’d like more, but even though I’m happy about being able to run, the amazement’s worn off.\n*I generally think of a good run at anything about 80%. On those runs, I get into the zone and outperform my best. Obviously, I can still run really fast even when I’m not motivated, but there’s a clear difference between me when I’m feeling good and feeling bad. I could make 40% motivation Ryoka eat my dust and lap her if I were at 90% motivation.\nNormally, that’s good enough for any kind of run. I could do a marathon like this, but as everyone’s said, these High Passes are different. I read up a bit on them with the local literature and—\nYeah, I might die. So I need to prepare a bit before I go, and quickly too. Fortunately, I’m in Celum, and even more fortunately, a certain Minotaur and a bunch of adventurers like to frequent the inn where I stay.\nI pick up my pace as I head towards the inn. Garia might be able to slow the other Runners down, but I really doubt she’ll buy me more than a minute. I’ll make a pit stop at the inn and head out.\nI’ve gotta hurry either way. It’s already midday, and the High Passes are far enough that I should hurry. I’ll be heading about halfway through the pass, so I do need supplies. And the Horns of Hammerad are the only people who’ll lend me stuff right now. Aside from Magnolia. She can go to hell along with the other Runners.\nDamn it. I\nhate\nhaving no money.",

    "text": "Delays.\nRyoka tried not to grit her teeth. She hated delays. But explanations took time, especially when the ones she was trying to explain to weren’t that quick on the uptake.\nGerial blinked at Ryoka again. He, Ceria, and the male magician from the Horns of Hammerad had been eating lunch when Ryoka found them.\n“Let me get this straight. You’re going on a dangerous delivery, and you need our help. And…you want us to take your belongings?”\nRyoka nodded.\n“I’m going to be gone for at least a day, and the other Runners are probably going to trash my room while I’m gone.”\n“Why would they do that?”\nRyoka shrugged.\n“If Persua’s anything like the other girls I’ve known, that’s one of the first things she’ll do. Good thing I don’t have any shoes so she can’t fill them with thumbtacks.”\nAgain, Gerial blinked uncomprehendingly at Ryoka. But Ceria nodded.\n“We’ll guard your things. Runners wouldn’t dare break into the Adventurer’s Guild, and we have our own storage space. But what’s this about help? We could escort you to the outskirts of the Passes, but Calruz isn’t here, and we’re understrength. And frankly, even at our best, we wouldn’t be able to go far into the Passes.”\n“I don’t need an escort. I just need supplies. Healing potions—food—I’d buy it myself, but I don’t have any money. I’ll pay you back—double what I’m borrowing.”\nGerial and Ceria exchanged a glance. He nodded. She reached down below the table and opened a travel bag.\n“I’ve got some healing potions right here. And a few dry rations. Enough for four meals.”\n“That’s enough.”\n“Then take them.”\nCeria pulled out several colored potions from her pack and handed them to Ryoka.\n“These are better quality than you’d buy in the marketplace anyways. And you’ll need them.”\nRyoka hesitated.\n“Are you sure? I can buy some—”\n“I thought you were broke, Ryoka. We still don’t have any contracts, and Calruz isn’t back yet. Take the potions, Ryoka. If everything I’ve heard about the High Passes is true, you’ll need them.”\nShe was right. Ryoka nodded and silently began stowing the potions in her own pack. They were various hues of red and yellow, which Ryoka fastened to the outside of her pack so she could reach them quickly.\nYellow health potions didn’t feel\nright\nto Ryoka, but apparently, color didn’t really matter with most potions. Anyone could toss some food dye in a bottle to make potions whatever color they wanted. She supposed she should just be grateful health potions didn’t look like vomit. They tasted like vomit, but that was an entirely different matter.\nRyoka gently set her pack down on the floor next to Ceria’s.\n“Thanks. Really.”\nGerial frowned, anxious.\n“I’m still not sure I agree with this. Are you\nsure\nyou have to do this? If the Runner’s Guild is giving you so much trouble, why not seek work elsewhere?”\nRyoka shook her head.\n“I’m taking a delivery request. The reward is for eighty gold coins.”\nAll three adventurers whistled.\n“Besides, if I take this request, I should be able to find work even if they keep blocking me. I just need the money.”\n“We could lend you—”\n“No.”\nRyoka stood up.\n“I’ll get my stuff.”\nGerial stared helplessly as she walked upstairs to her room. The male mage patted him on the shoulder.\n“Nice try. But she’s determined, isn’t she?”\n“I never knew the Runner’s Guild was like that.”\nCeria shook her head.\n“It’s the same in every guild. Ours is no different.”\n“But—”\n“Believe me, Gerial. If you look close enough, you see the same things repeated over and over. Humans are just like that.”\nBoth men looked sideways at Ceria but made no further comment. They stared at the stairs, silent in the general hubbub of the inn. They didn’t notice the girl Ryoka would have described inaccurately as sallow-faced sneaking up to the packs on the ground and swiftly rearranging the contents of both.\nA quick few minutes later, Ryoka clattered down the stairs, nearly knocking a barmaid over. She had all of her possessions bundled in her arms, which she dropped on the table, nearly into the adventurers’ meals. Only a quick flick of Ceria’s wrist made the bowls and plates spin off onto another table.\n“Here.”\nRyoka didn’t have much. Just some clothing, the magic bandages, and quite a few books that interested Ceria. She handed them all to Gerial, ignoring his blushes as he handled her underwear and equivalent to a sports bra. Then she paused and pulled one last item from her pocket.\n“Take care of this. It’s very fragile.”\nGerial blinked down at the rectangle of metal and plastic in his hands. He had never seen anything like it—in fact, the smooth casing of the iPhone was completely, unsettlingly alien to him.\nCeria leaned over the table, suddenly fascinated. She and the other mage stared at the iPhone, astonished,\n“What is\nthat?\n”\n“A device. I’ll explain it if I get back.”\nGerial held it at arm’s length.\n“Will it—will it do anything?”\nRyoka shook her head, almost sadly for her. She touched the blank display regretfully.\n“It’s broken. Just treat it carefully—don’t put anything heavy on it and don’t drop it.”\n“If it’s broken, can’t you repair it?”\nRyoka smiled as if Gerial had told a very funny joke.\n“No blacksmith or craftsman in the world could fix this. Trust me.”\n“Then what about magic?”\n“What?”\nThe male mage shrugged. He pushed his plates aside and picked up a faintly shining wand from the table.\n“Would you let me try a spell?”\nRyoka hesitated. She was clearly torn, but then she nodded. Very slowly, Gerial handed the iPhone to the mage. He inspected it, running his fingers delicately across the touchscreen.\n“What exquisite craftsmanship. I can’t detect any faults, but perhaps the issue lies within? Regardless, if it is not of magical creation—”\n“It’s not.”\n“Then this should work. [Repair].”\nThe mage waved his wand in a half-crescent and then tapped the iPhone. The tip of the wand flashed green as it touched the casing—\nAnd then the iPhone’s screen flickered into life.\nCeria gasped, but Gerial’s reaction was even more dramatic. He shot backwards in his chair and crashed to the ground in surprise. Ryoka just stared. She stared and stared at the iPhone.\n“Done.”\nThe mage smiled and handed Ryoka her iPhone. He stared with intense fascination at the brightly lit screen and then at Ryoka’s face. She was just staring at the iPhone in her hand. Staring and staring. But then she touched the screen and swiped it.\nThe display changed. Ceria and the mage were astonished twice-over, perhaps because they could sense no magic in the iPhone despite what was happening, but Ryoka just sighed. She turned to the mage.\n“Sorry, I never got your name. Or maybe I forgot. What is it?”\nHe blinked and then smiled.\n“Sostrom Reidez, at your service, Miss Ryoka Griffin.”\n“Sostrom.”\nRyoka took his hand and shook it. She looked him in the eye.\n“I owe you a great debt.”\nSostrom flushed lightly. He was in his early thirties or his very late twenties but unfortunately bald save for his eyebrows. He tugged his pointy hat lower on his head.\n“It was nothing, really. Just a spell—”\n“Not just a spell.”\nRyoka smiled at him. In the dim lighting of the inn, the iPhone’s glow lit up her face.\n“Not just a spell. Someday, you’ll have to teach me it. If I can do magic, it would be just to cast that. And now—those assholes aren’t going to know what hit them.”\nShe turned and walked out the inn. The three Horns of Hammerad exchanged a glance and then rose to follow her. They couldn’t tell what—but something had changed about Ryoka in the moments after Sostrom had repaired her phone.\nShe seemed different.\nShe was different.",

    "text": "The iPhone is warm in my hand. It glows, and it makes the rest of the world seem different. The vivid colors of this world are quite, quite different from the artificial colors on the display. Both are brilliant in their own way.\nIt is fixed. Completely, utterly. The power bar reads 100% at the top of the screen. It’s the most glorious thing I’ve ever seen, bar my healed leg. And it is fixed.\nI barely even feel my body as I walk outside. It feels as though I’m floating in a world of my own. Legs—fixed. iPhone—fixed. That’s all I need.\nIt’s time. Time to do what I’ve always wanted to do.\nI step out into the middle of the street. No carts are passing by, and the pedestrians are mostly in for lunch. The others ignore me. Some stare at my iPhone, but I am just another Runner. That’s the way I like it.\nExcept of course that there’s always someone watching. Ceria, Gerial, and Sostrom have come out of the inn to watch me, but I can see several Street Runners casually lounging across the street. Ready to follow and intercept? Most likely.\nAnd of course, I can’t see anyone else, but there’s a prickle on the back of my neck. I wonder if Lady Magnolia hires assassins or whether her maids have diverse skill sets. Or maybe it’s someone else. Who knows? Who cares?\nDeath. That’s what everyone tells me the High Passes are. And they’re right. It’s probably the most dangerous spot in this part of the continent. Even if it’s not certain death, it’s more than any sane person would want to risk.\nBut I’m not sane. Nor am I a normal person. Fear and exhilaration share equal parts in my heart right now. I want to see it. People tell me something is deadly and dangerous? I want to see it for myself.\nBesides, what about this world is normal? What about this world is sane? Ever since I’ve come here, I’ve slowly pieced together the real shape of this crazy planet. From the local area, you might think it’s safe, a kind of medieval culture advanced several hundred years technologically thanks to magic. But it’s not. I know it.\nIn this world, the untamed wilds threaten to overwhelm the fragile peace of civilization. Though the thinking races of this world are numerous and possess technology and magic, their hold is tenuous. When the undead rise in numbers or the\nthings\nliving at the far edges of the earth venture out, nations burn.\nThe books I bought tell me different things from people. And that’s because books are written by individuals, while people are quite stupid. People only know what they want to know. The individuals who write books make it their business to know as much as they can.\nPeace and stagnation. War that does not change. This continent is wracked by it. The Human nations fight against the non-Humans to the south, sending armies to fight and die in the Blood Fields each year. A genteel war to fight only in the same place? No. But the cost of a true war where cities fall is too much for either side at the moment. So it’s a long war of attrition and changing alliances. Meanwhile, the natural landscape and monster attacks are enough of a problem for the city-states either way.\nBut this continent is peaceful. Compared to some.\nTo the northeast, far across the seas, the Blighted King wages an eternal war against monster tribes and demons. His continent has seen war for five thousand years, and his is one of the last nations not consumed. Nations send their own armies to support him, but his people have never known peace. Their heroes and soldiers are some of the finest and the most impoverished. He fights a daily war that he is losing over the course of years.\nIn the south of the world lies a continent called Chandrar. The largest desert in the world fills the center of that landmass, and no one lives there; all the countries and kingdoms surround that death zone, fighting for moisture and land in the livable spaces.\nChandrar has more dead nations than any other continent. Poverty is ever-present there too, but the nations still fight over what’s left like starving dogs. They used to be unified, but the kingdom which united another continent collapsed and now everyone’s worse off. A classic story.\nOnce, a warlord unlike any other managed to conquer the whole damn continent and was sweeping through this one when his empire suddenly collapsed. None of the books said why this was. This king did not die—nor was he apparently harmed. But he abandoned his dreams of world conquest. Now he sits in his crumbling kingdom as other countries pick apart his once-great empire. The King of Destruction sleeps.\nThe continent north of this one is filled with Humans. Terandria. They have subjugated their lands and created a peaceful continent, or at least one with fewer monsters. But despite that, they fight amongst themselves in a never-ending battle for supremacy. Their royal families hold mighty artifacts in their vaults but fear to use them in case of mutually assured destruction. It sounds like a bunch of kingdoms of inbred, infighting [Kings] and [Queens]. Europe, essentially.\nOther nations. I have read of them. The western oceans contain the last continent, a jungle in the south, plains and then tundra to the north. The species there are—odd—but Baleros is engulfed by endless low-level conflicts that give rise to an entire culture of [Mercenary] companies. Four of the biggest companies practically rule the entire continent, and a lot of the wilds of Baleros lie unexplored.\nA few other great powers exist, like an archipelago called ‘Drath,’ ruled by, you guessed it, an [Emperor]. Few nations have no monarch. Even Calruz’s homeland, called the House of Minos, another archipelago, has a Minotaur King.\nApparently, they fight against some kind of eternal threat similar to the Blighted Kingdom of Rhir. Some sworn enemy of the world is enough to keep nearly a million Minotaurs in a constant state of war and peace. Well, a million is the number the book I read touted, but it was written using information decades old. But the Empire of Minos has its own strange culture Humans and other races don’t want to learn about for some reason.\nMore continents, more islands and places my books could only hint at, that once existed or have changed—but I want to visit more than anything.\nAn icy arctic shelf with icecaps taller than skyscrapers in Terandria’s north. The ‘end of the world,’ The Last Tide, which has killed more ships and taken countless explorers and armies, never to return.\nA legendary isle where mages gather to learn spells and where anyone is free to study, Wistram, the Academy of Mages. Even continents that once stood that are now buried in the ocean, cities of people who live under the water, Drowned Folk.\nThese are the legends and wonders that shape this world. Yet here I am, in one of the most boring places in one of the safest parts of the world, and people warn me about the High Passes as if they’re dangerous? For all the unrest, this is an era of peace. All the terrible battles happened long ago.\nThe gods are dead, and no one tells me who these gods were or how they know they’re dead. Because I knew to look for them, I found hints of the Elves, but no book of nations and countries lists their race anywhere. They’re long dead, and half-Elves are the only species around who bear their legacy. The Dwarves are hidden in the heart of mountains that make the Himalayas look like foothills.\nThe age of great wars, myth and legends has ended. Magic endures, but those who wield it have faded. Nations fight in brush wars, but the balance of power has been kept. There’s a marker for this era: The Waning World, it’s called. Well, the book claims that Gnolls named it that. Do Gnolls get to decide what each era is called? I like the name.\nThis is not a time of heroes. And that’s fine with me. I am no hero. But I want to see what remains. I want to see what wonders still lurk in this world. For I am certain: they are legion.\nThe world I’ve seen so far—the cities and people here—are so petty. They care only about their small struggles and what they think of each other. Magnolia, for all her cunning, is a small landowner in a tiny part of the world. And that is wonderful.\nThe worst thing that ever happened to my world was globalization. Once we reached the ends of the earth, we lost our curiosity, our drive to\ngrow\n. But I feel it. It calls to me.\nAdventure\n. Pure and simple.\nI can see the other Runners watching me. But I don’t care about them. The iPhone is warm in my hand.\nI tap the screen, and it lights up. Gerial and the other Horns of Hammerad gasp again, and even Ceria looks amazed. But to me, it’s like looking at an old friend.\nAn old friend. An iPhone 4, to be exact. Black, sleek. It used to be full of scratches and dents where I dropped it, but now, the plastic shines in the daylight. It looks like it just came out of the box.\nSlide to unlock. No password. I should probably put one on, just in case. If I lose my iPhone, I deserve to let it get hacked. Not that there’s too much on there. A few books, saved files, an empty contact list, basic essentials like Safari, which is useless here…only one thing takes up nearly all 32 GB on my phone.\nMusic.\nIt’s all there. Thousands of songs, some great, some only mediocre. But every song I ever liked and bought—or more often downloaded illegally—is here. All here.\nI can’t help it. I start laughing. Laughing for the pure, joyous salvation of magic. It’s given me everything I’ve ever wanted. My wings, and now my music. With it—with this—\nI am free.",

To the confusion of everyone watching, she plugged them into her iPhone and then into her ears. Then she turned and began to jog.\nThe Street Runners left their positions and began to follow, but Ryoka’s jog turned into a fast run in an instant.

Did it resemble anything you saw in Wistram Academy, Ceria?”\nCeria raised an eyebrow at Sostrom.\n“I’ve no idea. Besides, that thing had no magic in it. How strange.

    "text": "I’ve run races, marathons, even an ultra-marathon once. I’ve run through snow, rain, hail, through thunder and lightning and even hurricanes. But I’ve never run like this.\nMotivation. After so long of running in silence, the instant I heard the guitar’s first chords, my legs churn into overdrive.\n“Sweet Home Alabama” thunders in my ears as I race out the city. Lynyrd Skynyrd’s lyrics blast through my ears as I pick up speed, shedding Runners left and right. The music’s not the best for running—but far from the worst. And it’s not the song that matters so much right now. It’s just the music.\nRunning. Music. Running music. The greatest thing ever to be invented in the history of ever. It takes away the pain of running and puts me right into the zone. I could run barefoot on nails and—\nThat’s a terrible idea. But I\ncould\nprobably dodge highway traffic and run a six-minute mile forever while listening to music. How is it that it can take away your focus on running and at the same time focus my mind even more on running? I don’t know.\nIt’s just\nmusic\n.\nSweet home Alabama, where the skies are so blue.\nI’ve always wanted to go to Alabama just to run around listening to this song.\nMotion. A bunch of Runners are ahead of me. Fals and some of the highest-level City Runners. They want to cut me off, and they’re sprinting as fast as they can. And it might be a skill or a Skill, but they’re quick enough that they could actually catch me.\nOn any other day.\nI don’t even have to look down. I’ve memorized the exact placement on my iPhone so that my fingers can immediately find the next button. It’s not that I don’t love a good country rock song, but if I’m going to go full-throttle, I want faster music. The shuffle god works his magic. And then I hear it.\nOh. Hell yeah. I can tell when the first bell tolls which song it is. “I Will Not Bow” by Breaking Benjamin. Then the guitar and drums blast in, and everything disappears. I run like I’ve never run before.\nI catch one glimpse of Fals’ stunned face before I blow by him and the other City Runners. They can’t even turn fast enough to see me. The landscape blurs and disappears underneath my feet. I’m running just as fast as I did when I got my leg back. Fast as that. Faster.\nI am heavy metal. I am death and rock. I am running, and running becomes me. I will not be stopped.\nThe vocalist screams in my ears, and I run on. The High Passes await. A mysterious delivery request, deadly monsters, and mystery. I leave behind intrigue, angry Runners, and petty infighting with every step. Onwards, ever onwards. I run with music taking away the pain of the world and run to keep death from catching up.\nAt last.\nI am free.\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "I slow down after about twenty minutes of sprinting. Not because I don’t feel like running faster, but I know I’ve got a long way to go.\nSo I reduce my pace from record-breaking speed to a sustainable jog. A bit faster than normal, but I can’t help it.\nI’ve got the music.\nCurrently, I’m running to the not-so-fast-paced song, “Heathens” by twenty one pilots. I love it. And the movie it was written for—Suicide Squad—I really wanted to watch it, even though I thought it might not be as insanely horrific as I hoped. PG-13? Really?\nGreat concept, though. It came out just a month before I came to this world. I always meant to see it, but I kept putting it off. Guess I’ll never see it now.\nHm. Thinking of home or the world I came from hurts a bit. But it’s more like a thorn that I’ve pulled out of my foot* a while ago. It still hurts, but the place I’ve come to makes up for it. In some ways. In other ways, it’s just as crap, but at least—\n*More than once. Painful, and way worse than stepping on glass. Actually, barefoot runners rarely step on glass. Everyone thinks we do, but if\nyou\nwere running around barefoot, would you step on glass? Seriously. Think about it. It’s not hard to spot most of the time.\nYeah—At least the view is great.\nAn open landscape of rolling hills and an open dirt road stretches out before my eyes, punctuated only rarely by inconveniences like rocks or, in the distance, small buildings. It’s the most glorious sight for a runner. I can see wavy stalks of flowering plants in one field, bright and colorful. I’m assuming they’re there for harvest.\nEven the occasional animals sometimes delight, like the little rabbit with faintly purple fur that sprints out, sees me coming, and then\nblinks\nout of existence. Did it teleport? I look up, and a bird that glows flashes across the air, almost as if it’s laughing at me for being so slow.\nA Creona Flashbird—rare and prized around these parts. And up, higher and higher, lies my destination, that mountain range that ascends into the sky. Epic and wonderful and free of people.\nActually, the geography reminds me a lot of Mongolia. I used to stare at pictures of the endless grasslands there and dream of running by myself for days. But this place, this makes Mongolia look like a cramped hipster coffee shop in the middle of a city.\nThis world is big. And even that word is too small to encompass the land around me. Endless is probably a better word for the scale of this planet. Even the sky is larger, or at least that’s how it feels. But how would gravity work if that’s the case?\nMagic. Probably. Anyways, I’m not thinking about this again. Focus, Ryoka. Think about your job.\nHm. Let’s see. I’ve ditched Fals and the rest of the jackasses that call themselves Runners. That’s a good first step. Now, Celum is a ways away from the High Passes. Only two cities are actually\nin\nthe High Passes, Esthelm and Liscor, although they’re in the safe route with roads and far fewer monsters, not the untamed wilds.\nIn any case, I can relax. I’m running at a quick pace, but it’ll take a few hours to get there. So I relax and let my mind wander.",

    "text": "Run. Run and eat. Run and stop to pee. Run and slow to a walk for a while. Normally, I’d be busy thinking all this time, but instead, I just listen to music. It’s been so long every song is fresh and amazing to listen to.\nIn between that, I do stop the music to concentrate. As a Runner, it’s important to be aware of my surroundings. And a few things have been bothering me.\nFirstly, I know the local landscape. Around here—around most of the northern part of this continent, the geography alternates between relatively flat land and the mountainous passes that lead to the southern continent. True, there are heavily forested regions further northwest, and from what I’ve heard, several large rivers that create a transportation network that makes Runners slightly obsolete. But that’s north, and I haven’t travelled that far.\nThose Five Families I heard about are largely in the north—Magnolia’s the one too far south. Five houses of influential people doesn’t sound fun—but they have gigantic pastures of land I want to see. That forest? Apparently it was one of the last ‘great forests’ of the world, the Vale Forest. Sounds like fun—if not for my feet.\nIn the same way, I haven’t gone past Liscor to the south. That’s where the landscape gets nasty apparently. What people call the Blood Fields separates the north from the south, a kind of battleground that changed the very ecosystem. No wonder Humans don’t go down there. But it is home to the largest plains in the entire world where Gnolls live…\nWhere I’m running—the plains north of the High Passes—is one of the better parts to be in this region. The only threats around here are Goblins and a few weaker examples of monsters. But the closer I get to the High Passes, the more likely I am to run into something nasty. Exactly what monsters live in the mountains I don’t know, but they make the ones living in the Human lands look cute by comparison.\nThat’s the first problem. The second is that there are a bunch of fireflies following me.\nFireflies. Or—animated sparks of light? That’s the closest thing I can think of to describe them. It’s like—well, it’s like some kind of magic maybe? These…symbols keep flashing around my head, and I swear I can hear something whenever I look at these flashes of color that are whirling around my head. They keep trying to get a lock on me, but whenever they do, I speed up and lose them.\nIt’s probably some kind of curse. I don’t know if Persua has enough money to hire a [Mage] or if it’s possible to call down lightning on me, but I’m not dealing with whatever it is.\nKeep running. I just wish whoever’s casting the spell would give up. It’s getting annoying. But I can turn up the music, and the garbled speech tunes out. Okay, what else?\nI’ve got the details of the open request memorized and written down, for all the good that does me. It’s a request to deliver a package, but what the package might be or who’s requesting it isn’t clear. That’s the uncertainty of an open request and the reason why few Runners want to accept them. But the pay’s extraordinary, so that’s enough.\nWith open requests, I go to the location marked and I’ll receive my pay in advance. The sender tells me where to go, and we can negotiate a second fee, or I tow the delivery back to the Runner’s Guild where someone else can finish the job.\nIt’s not the greatest system, but it works when dealing with areas where identity and safety can’t be assured. Apparently, all deliveries used to work more or less like this, but the new system in the Runner’s Guild is safer for Runners.\nI could be walking into a trap. Please don’t let me be walking into a trap.\nAnyways, I’m looking for a cave down the main road* of the High Passes. It will be marked by a yellow banner of some kind.\n*I use the word road only in the loosest sense. Rather than a road, you could call it the only vaguely flat terrain that winds through the mountains and through stone passes and the network of caves.\nThat’s all I have to go on, and I’m only a few miles away from the High Passes. Now I can see the mountains looming ahead of me, rust-colored rock towering in the sky. And they are\nhuge\n. I can look up and not even sense a mountain getting smaller before it disappears into the foggy, clouded sky overhead.\nA mountain taller than Everest? Perhaps not, but it’s probably close. And that’s just one mountain of the countless ones here. Together, they form an impenetrable barricade, save for the small gap that winds through the passes.\nWell, a small gap here is a road about as wide as two football fields placed side by side. And again, if it’s a road, it’s the most crap road in the world. This one has boulders scattered throughout it taller than fully grown oak trees. But it is semi-flat, and that’s enough.\nI really hope I don’t cut my feet on the rocks. I should be fine; my calluses are really tough, but—\nSomething flashes past my face and hits the grass. Instinctively, I duck, and that’s when I see them. A horde of little green men, except these ones ain’t aliens.\n“Shit.”\nI guess listening to loud music really isn’t a good idea when you’re supposed to be watching out for trouble. That’s probably why I never noticed the group of Goblins until they were right on top of me.\nThey spread out around me, a mob of Goblins. Not too many, at least by their standards, but a lot. I can’t spare time to count. Twenty—thirty of them? Some have bows, like the one who just shot at me, but most are carrying weapons. Rusted swords, daggers, and even a buckler or two. But they’re unarmored, ragged.\nThey could dice me up in seconds. And they’ve got me flanked this time.\nThis is bad. But I raise my hands and make fists. I haven’t needed to fight before, but it’s not because I couldn’t. And today, I’m at the top of my game.\nThe Goblins grin. They only see a Human female, alone, separated, and unarmed. Not a threat. That’s fine by me. I see a bunch of guys who I can hit as hard as I want and who have way less muscle and reach than a normal group of thugs. And I know kung fu*.\n*I do\nnot\nknow kung fu. I practice a version of Muay Thai geared towards MMA, although I didn’t do any actual mixed martial arts. Damn overprotective parents.\nWiden my stance, tilt my body forwards and down, hands up and loosely clasped into fists. I put more weight on my front leg. I bounce up and down, ready to move at a moment’s notice.\nI’ve been in fights. Not many; definitely not the kind of straight up bloodbaths you hear about in inner cities, but I’ve had to defend myself more than once. More than that, after my first fight, my parents had me learn martial arts to defend myself. I studied how to fight.\nThe Goblins are still spreading out around me, waiting for one of them to make the first move. Maybe they can tell I’m not like a normal girl because I’m not screaming or trying to run. Instead, I dodge back and forth, keeping my distance, trying not to let them get my back.\nOne of the rules of fighting a group is never to let them surround you. Lead them on in a line if you can. Second, never let an opportunity to attack slip by. Be sure you know when they’re about to come at you.\nAnd striking first is good. So as the first Goblin decides it’s time to get the ball rolling and darts forward with a shrill cry, I step forwards.\nStep in, rotate hips, and put all that motion into a punch. I catch the Goblin in the head right as he charges. It’s a satisfyingly solid punch, and I feel it go right through the bugger.\nHe folds up. No confused blink, no comedic pratfall. The Goblin just falls down and doesn’t get up. That’s what a proper punch does.\nThe other Goblins blink in consternation. That shouldn’t have happened. But they’re fighters. They look cute in an evil sort of way, but they’re all killers. Probably even normal street thugs aren’t as vicious as these guys. So when they see the first guy go down, seven come at me at once.\nI back up. And then I turn and punch. Not to really hit a target, but to get the other Goblins behind me to back up. They were about to rush me, but they flinch away, and I dash past them. Okay, now my back’s safe. So I turn and let the others come at me.\nA line. They’re doing the stupid tactic of rushing me without doing it all together. So I jump forwards, punch once, twice. Two Goblins fold up, and I hop back, letting them trip up their friends.\nA Goblin leaps over his friends, and in the air I hit him in the stomach. He starts throwing up even as he lands. Another comes around the side, and this time, he’s smart enough to start swinging before he gets to me. I wait. Swing, swing…\nAs his knife goes too far left, I step in and hit him. I’ve got a longer reach if I extend, way longer than his short arms. Another unconscious Goblin.\nThe last three Goblins slow, but one of them is dumber than the rest. He keeps coming, and I decide to get fancy. Instead of punching, I back up and then do a roundhouse kick.\nMuay Thai is a martial art that emphasizes really strong kicks. And one of their famous kicks is the roundhouse. Naturally, it was one of my favorite moves to practice.\nThe Goblin lets me set it up. He’s watching my hands, so he never sees my leg flash up. I can kick nearly as fast as I punch, and I catch him right across the head. Short as Goblins are, my kicks are more head level than at their side or chest like normal Humans.\nMy foot connects with his head, and I feel his flesh\nsquish.\nAnd then I feel something give way and hear a\ncrack\n. The Goblin tumbles, flies, and rolls to a stop in the grass. He doesn’t move. And my heart stops.\nThe other Goblins look down at their fallen friend and up at me. I know I should be watching to see if they’ll rush me, but my eyes are fixed on the Goblin. I—I didn’t mean to hit him that hard. Not in the head.\nHe’s too still. The fallen Goblin doesn’t even twitch. He—he’s—\nHe’s dead. I killed him.\nI’ve never killed another creature before. I’ve hunted for fun, but I don’t shoot animals. Even in fights, I only broke bones. I don’t kill.\nBut he’s dead. And it was so quick, too.\nI stare down at the Goblin and then see a black shape speeding at my head. I duck, and the arrow misses my cheek by a few inches. The Goblin archer lowers his bow and shouts something at his friends.\nI—what do I do? The Goblins are moving again, trying to surround me. They don’t want to get close this time, but the archers are all pulling out their short, stubby arrows.\nI need to run or fight. I’ll—I’ll blitz the Goblin archers, hit them, and then run for it. I start weaving and dodging left and right, giving them less of a target.\nI just killed—\nThe archer in the back, the one who shot twice at me, is their leader. I need to hit him and maybe the Goblins will give up on me. He’s got a few Goblins in front of him, but if I rush the group…\nThe Goblin pulls an arrow and sights at me. My body tenses—\nAnd the Goblin archer’s head disappears. Not disappears in a cute way like he ducked down or he fell over. No. The entire neck and skin pulls away as a massive jaw closes over his head and\nrips\nhis head clean off.\n“\nHoly—\n”\nThe Goblins turn. One screams, raises his sword, and a claw cuts his stomach open. I back up. The Goblins back up. The gigantic wolf casually grabs another Goblin, bites down, shakes him around, and tosses him to one side like confetti.\nA wolf. A huge, giant wolf. Not the kind from my world; a proper, Big Bad Wolf of the plains, nearly as big as I am. Bigger. He’s got more mass.\nThe wolf sniffs and eyes me. The Goblins are already running, but he’s not interested in them. He’s looking straight at me.\nCalm down*. It’s not the same as a Dire Wolf from George R. R. Martin’s books. Those things are big as horses, right? This one’s—this one’s only twice as big as a normal wolf. Only twice.\n*\nCalm down! Don’t panic! Holy gods, it’s\nhuge!\nIt has rust-red fur. Why the hell—is it because of the blood? It paws the ground, sniffs again, and then slowly begins to circle me. It’s so big, and unlike the Goblins, I can see muscles rippling under its fur.\nNo time to run or even think. I raise my hands again. Wolves can outrun Humans, just like bears. And running makes me prey. I need to get it to back down or leave.\n“Bring it.”\nTrouble is, this wolf isn’t like normal ones. Wolves from my world don’t hunt Humans in general. But this one just ate a Goblin’s head. So maybe the ones here have a taste for humanoids.\nIt sniffs at me again. And then the wolf lowers its head. Oh shit. It’s gonna—\nI barely see the wolf move. It launches at me, and I throw myself sideways. The wolf lands, turns, and I run forwards and punch it in the head.\nNo thinking. Just action. I’ve practiced these moves enough that my body overrides my panicked brain. Punch, punch, step back. The wolf snaps at me and I twist. My leg flashes up and sideways and catches the wolf in the wide of the head. A solid strike.\nRoundhouse kick. I once watched a documentary about the power behind Muay Thai kicks. Getting hit by one by a world champion is like being hit by a car at 35 MPH. Well, I’m not the world champion, but the giant wolf still blinks and shakes its head. It wobbles on its paws, and I step forwards.\nAnother kick that’s illegal in MMA is hitting your opponent with your knee when he’s down. That’s a lethal move. Actually, all of Muay Thai moves are meant to kill, but knees and elbows are really nasty. I was taught a hundred times not to hit anyone in the head with a knee unless I wanted to kill them.\nI just hope my teacher wasn’t exaggerating. I run forwards and knee the damn dog as hard as I can in the face. I heard something\ncrunch\n. It feels like my knee.\nThe wolf blinks, backs up a few steps, and then snarls.\n—Ah.\nIt’s funny. Back in my world, I thought I was pretty hot stuff. Certainly, I’ve never lost a fight with the other stupid kids my age. And I was talented.\nI practiced in an actual contact gym, and I got good enough that my instructor said I might have a future in the ring…until my parents vetoed that idea. At that level, I could teach martial arts myself if I didn’t want to be sexually harassed and laughed at all day long. Reaching that level at my age is extremely rare*, and I know how to fight.\nI’ve been in street fights, or at least, school fights and being jumped while running. There’s a difference between knowing martial arts and having a black belt at a McDojo**.\n*Having a personal gym and near-perfect memory helps, though. Also, parents who let you practice martial arts as much as you want if it keeps you out of trouble.\n**McDojo. Great term. It describes every cafeteria and gym for kids who just want to show off rather than learn actual techniques. I kicked a black-belt ‘expert’ once and broke two of his ribs. Good times.\nI know how to fight. And even if I’m not nearly as good as someone who walks in and out of brawls or has trained longer, I’d put money on me beating most of the adventurers below Gold-rank. Because they’re Human, or humanoid. And martial arts don’t exist in this world, at least as far as I know.\nBut martial arts from Earth weren’t designed to fight monsters.\nThe wolf I just roundhouse kicked and kneed in the face gets up and shakes itself like nothing happened. Then it looks at me and\ngrowls.\nIts nose looks wet, but I don’t think I hurt it much. In fact, I think I just pissed it off.\nIt advances fast. I punch, but the wolf snaps at my hand, and I nearly lose it. It dashes around me, and I spin to keep up. It’s so damn\nquick!\nThe wolf snaps at my leg, and I back up, kicking. But it’s too fast, and the fur on the wolf is like armor. It rushes me again, and this time, I can feel its hot breath on my front as I leap back.\nMuay Thai was never meant to fight a creature that fights with its teeth. I try to get my distance, but the wolf advances.\nFuck. It’s not gonna let me get away. And I don’t know what to do. If I were faster, I’d try to poke its damn\neyes\nout. But the wolf is dodging left and right.",

    "text": "I try to punch the wolf, but again, the fur takes all the force away. And then the wolf twists its head and closes its fangs over—\nAaaaaaah!\nFireworks. I hammer at the wolf’s face and then mash one of its eyes. It lets go then and howls in agony. I do too.\nMy\narm!\nIt bit down for only a second, but I think it cracked the bone! I stagger away from the wolf, and mercifully, it doesn’t follow. It’s shaking its head, and I can feel something wet on my fingers. I think I destroyed its eye, but I have to get away.\nI start running. From a standing start to a sprint, I’m running. Behind me, I can hear the wolf howling. In agony? No—this sounds worse.\nIt sounds like a call to the pack.\nJust as I think that, I hear more howls, this time in the distance. But they start getting louder, so I run on. My arm is bleeding freely, but I run on. No time to stop.\nGlancing over my shoulder. I can see the wolf following, but only to keep me in its sight. It wants to gather the pack. And here they come. Blurring shapes race over a hill, fast,\nfast.\nMy arm!\nI can’t—the wolf tore away a huge chunk of flesh. I need a potion.\nThey’re in my pack, strapped to the outside for easy reach. I grab one, pop the cork, and down it, choking on the liquid. Then I hurl the bottle at the nearest wolf, making it dodge away.\nThe foul liquid goes down, and I wait for relief as I sprint desperately for the High Passes. The landscape changes beneath my feet. Suddenly, I’m running across what feels closer to clay, and the soil and even rocks turn a dark orange-red. And the mountains are right in front of me.\nThe wolves follow, howling even as more of them race out of the plains. They’re coming.\nI’m never going to lose them on the open ground. I hear a growl and run left as a wolf jumps. It hits the ground, and I scramble up the rocky ground. Up the slope. Aren’t wolves supposed to have a harder time climbing or something?\nIt works. The wolf packs slows, and I can see them having a harder time scrambling up the rocks. But they are coming. And they’re still\nhowling\n, making my blood run cold.\nGotta run. Must keep moving. I scramble up the incline, cutting my legs and hands against the jagged surface. And I feel sick? Why? My arm still burns. It should—it should be healing.\nUp. I see a ledge and leap for it. It’s high, but I grab the edge and hoist myself up. The wolves charge, but they’re too late. I’m above them, safe for the moment.\nOn the ledge, I back away from the wolf pack and lean against the rock face, breathing heavily. I feel sick. Sick, tired, and the adrenaline in my veins is making me shake. And I’m still bleeding? Why?\nAnother potion. I fumble at my pack, pull out the bottle of red liquid, and down it in one go. I wait for relief. Nothing.\nConfused and sick as I am, I down another potion before I realize something is seriously wrong, and at that point—\nI throw up. Something is—the potion I drank is\nburning\nin my veins. What the hell? It’s not a healing potion. What is—\nSomething hops down from the rocks above me. I shout, hurl the potion bottle, and nearly slip in my own vomit. The goat stares reproachfully at me and\nbahs\nloudly even as the wolves keep howling and snarling below.\n“A goat?”\nA goddamn goat. It scared the crap out of me. But it doesn’t appear frightened of me or the wolves. In fact, it takes one look at the wolf pack trying to make its way up to where I am and\nbahs\nagain, loudly.\nThe goat has two wide eyes on either side of its head. It looks stupid—or insane, and this one has to be brain-damaged because the snarling wolves and I are both bigger than it is. It’s clearly wild and has ragged fur, oddly damaged. It looks like it’s survived mauling before, but this is the day it dies. Because it, like me, is stupid.\n…Or is it just me?\nBecause that first bah suddenly gets an answer.\nMore\nbahs\n. This time, they’re all around me. I look up and see goats lining the cliffs and rocks on the High Passes. They hop up and down the cliff faces easily, making for me and the pack. What the hell? Are they not afraid of the wolves? But now the wolves are backing away from me and snarling at the goats.\nWhy—\nThe goat near me\nbahs\nagain, loudly. In fact, it sounds more like a scream at this point. A scream, and now it gets real close. Suddenly, I have a really bad feeling. I back up, and the goat advances.\nThe goat opens its mouth, and I see its teeth. Goats should\nnot have pointy teeth\n. And its mouth is unnaturally wide.\nThe goat’s jaw dislocates, and I see a gaping maw coming my way. It’s running and shrieking like a demented monster\n. It\nscreams,\nand I\nscream and run, and the Carn Wolves are running away. I try to follow, but they’re all around me and—",

    "text": "“The High Passes.”\nLady Magnolia breathed the words as she stared at the man standing in her foyer. He was—well, knowing what he did, Magnolia would have expected the man to be wearing pure black clothing and armed to the teeth, but then, he wouldn’t be very inconspicuous, would he? [Assassins] were supposed to be stealthy.\nBut this man was so ordinary looking he was forgettable. Magnolia was sure it was some sort of Skill, just as she was sure that she was\nnot\nhappy with the current situation.\n“Please explain to me, Assassin Theofore, how it is that Ryoka Griffin was able to not only evade you and the others of your group, but that she is now, as I understand it,\nalone\nin the High Passes being chased by a group of Carn Wolves?”\nThe [Assassin] named Theofore clearly did not like being addressed by his name, but he was also wise enough not to take issue with Magnolia using it. He spread his gloved hands out and bowed his head.\n“My associates and I were fully prepared to guard Ryoka Griffin against attacks within the city and even outside of it. But we were unprepared for her to accept a request to the High Passes, let alone move so quickly.”\n“I did warn you she was quick. And the wolf pack?”\n“We were unable to do more than slay a few of the wolves gathering before they noticed our scent. And our group was not equipped for combat against monsters, milady. We assumed this would be a protection mission against other Humans and armed accordingly. We were forced to retreat, and for our failure, you will be fully reimbursed. But the Guild cannot take further responsibility for this, Lady Magnolia.”\nLady Magnolia pursed her lips, but the [Assassin] was right. No one could have predicted—\nWell, actually she could have predicted this if she’d known about the unmarked request beforehand. Magnolia knew Ryoka’s personality well, both from experience and her Skill. It was a slight oversight that cost her now and cost Ryoka—possibly her life.\nShe studied the [Assassin] and tapped her lips, glancing towards the window where the mountains loomed in the distance.\n“If I were to pull strings and send several teams of adventurers to the High Passes, would they get there in time?”\n“Perhaps to collect what remains of her corpse, Lady Magnolia. But even that is likely to have been devoured by now.”\nAgain, Magnolia had to suppress her vexation. Well, vexation was one word for it. She was considerably more than vexed, but a [Lady] took care to hide her emotions. Still, she had to give vent to it.\n“I was assured of the highest quality in hiring your guild. I believe I made it quite clear how important Ryoka’s life was?”\nThe [Assassin] was not in a good spot. Technically, he was a veteran of his Guild and perfectly able to take most lives with a single flick of his concealed blades. But he was standing in front of a woman who was definitely able to take any life she wanted, including his. Perhaps not directly, but the [Maid] standing behind Lady Magnolia was setting off all of Theofore’s warning bells. He eyed her warily as he chose the best words to respond with.\n“Had we known the Runner would venture into an area like the High Passes, we would have charged ten times the cost and sent our best agents. And even then, we would not have guaranteed her safety. Practically speaking, we would have attempted to subdue Ryoka Griffin long before she entered that area. Countless monsters abound there, Lady Reinhart. The wolves would be just another type of prey, there.”\n“Really? And here I was about to order you to go into the High Passes with your associates and get her out. Although your presence\nhere\nmeans, even with my carriage, you’ll be too late. Still, I may well order it after all.”\nMagnolia brightened at that. Theofore—hesitated.\nSend them into the High Passes?\nHe knew they were just Ranks, lowly members of the Guild, but she couldn’t do that! That was a death sentence.\nBut she was Magnolia Reinhart, and the Guild…\nhe began to sweat as Magnolia tapped her lips.\nWhat Theofore didn’t know was that she was only making an idle threat. Magnolia…her eyes flickered to Ressa’s face, reflected from one of the polished doorknobs, and the [Maid] grimaced.\nIt was him. It had to be.\nRyoka had a chance, however slim, and the [Assassins] could not be deployed. She sighed, and the [Assassin]’s sweat turned into imminent dehydration as Magnolia looked at him.\n“Is there any hope these other monsters would devour the wolves and leave Ryoka alive?”\n“Doubtful, Lady. They would try to kill anything that disturbed them. And it is likely that even if Ryoka outran the wolves, she would not be able to evade the most prevalent type of monster in the High Passes.”\n“And which would those be?”\n“Gargoyles.”",

    "text": "Gargoyles!\nI think I’m screaming. I’m definitely running, but I can barely feel my feet getting cut on the rocks between my nausea and the terror electrifying my body.\nThe nearest oddly shaped stone unfurls its massive stone wings and seizes the first goat trying to rip me to shreds. The goat tries to break free, bleating in panic, but the Gargoyle just reaches up and pulls the goat apart. Blood rains down around me as more of the deceptively innocuous rocks spring to life around me.\nI’ve just run straight into a nest of Gargoyles. That would normally be terrible by itself if it weren’t for the\npack of wolves and goats trying to eat me\n.\nThe rocky slope behind me is already filled with wolves and goats tearing each other to shreds. And the worst thing is that the wolves are\nlosing.\nThe goats came out of the cliffs in a horde and started\neating\nthe wolves, ripping them apart and fighting over the scraps.\nI ran uphill to get away from the ones chasing me, but instead, I just ran into worse trouble. For the Gargoyles, it’s like I just offered myself up on a plate and brought a lot of\nhors d’oeuvres.\nThe Gargoyle that just tore apart the goat tosses the pieces up. Its curved beak-mouth snaps, and it\ncrunches\nhorribly. The goats swerve and immediately retreat, but the other Gargoyles lumber forward. Half of them leap down towards the goats and wolves now in full retreat. The other half go after me.\nI run on. I haven’t stopped running, but I find some more juice and tell my legs to go even faster. I don’t know how they’re doing it.\nI feel sick. It’s like my body is shutting down, but at the same time, it’s like someone’s hitting me with a taser*. Even though I want to sit down and throw up, I’m running as fast as I ever have. It’s like I can’t run out of energy, and I need every drop.\n*Never been tased. Run!\nA huge Gargoyle unfolds in front of me. It looks vaguely like a bird crossed with an ogre, a hulking giant beast with skin that looks like stone but slides around like flesh. It opens its mouth, and I see a dark opening before something shoots out.\nI feel something spin me around and then stumble forwards. My hand goes up, and I feel at my shoulder. Sliced flesh. Deep slice. The Gargoyle fires again, and I stumble sideways. The stone fragments it spits miss me and eviscerate the wolf behind me.\nThe hell was\nthat?\nIt’s like a shotgun! And the sound the Gargoyles are making—a roaring warble that makes rocks tumble down. I can feel it in my bones.\nI can’t fight. I don’t even think of trying. Muay Thai doesn’t have any moves that teach you how to dodge bullets or break stone.\nSo I run. I was born to run. I was born to fly.\nThe nest of Gargoyles is high up. It’s a relatively open area, looking down on the high pass. Fifty—sixty feet below? It’s not a straight drop—more like a sharp incline. Normally, I’d descend with the utmost caution, but the Gargoyles lumber towards me,\nfast\n. So I dash towards the edge even as a Gargoyle charges me.\nMy feet leave the ground as I leap. I jump over the Gargoyle’s lashing stone tail and touch down on a rocky outcropping. Even as my feet find purchase, I look and move. Another jump, and now I’m aiming right for the rocky slope.\nStone cracks and deceptive crevices leap up at me as I fall in slow motion. The slope is a maze of places to twist or break my ankles. But I can see every fault in the rock face. My foot hits the edge of the cliff, and then I plunge down, sprinting down even as several rocky monsters lumber after me, spitting stone shards.\nLeft foot, stone spot. Right foot avoids the fragile green moss. I’m leaning forwards as I run down. Right, left, jump, pivot—\nI lose my balance and slam against a rock. I’m tumbling down, but I correct my footing and push off. I’m in the air for five seconds and then land and transfer the force of my fall into descending.\nFast. So\nfast\n. The slope is blurring beneath me, and I can see the open pass below. I’m going too fast to stop. So I\ntwist—",

    "text": "The almost vertical slope leading up to the Gargoyles’ lair crumbled away in the wake of Ryoka’s descent. Small stones bounced wildly down the uneven landscape, dislodging larger boulders and causing a minor earthquake. But even the avalanche was too slow to catch her.\nRyoka’s feet were a blur as she sped downwards, on a collision course with the ground. She was moving too fast. Even if she tried, the strain of taking all her momentum aimed downwards and transitioning to the flat ground might break her leg. So instead, she threw herself into a roll.\nRyoka hit the flat ground and tumbled fifteen feet before she landed on her back. She stared up at the cloudy sky, winded. But in another second, she was up and running. She was being chased.\nThe stony, half-avian, half-hulking forms of the Gargoyles launched themselves off the cliff. They did not fear breaking any body parts. One\nsmashed\ninto the ground behind Ryoka, making the earth shake around her. She ran on as the Gargoyle surged upwards and chased after her.\nHer body was electric. She felt like she was dying of the flu, yet more alive than she’d ever been. Ryoka was bleeding from her torn up feet, her bitten arm, and the places where the Gargoyle’s shrapnel fire had cut her flesh. Her clothes were torn, and she was bruised from countless impacts.\nThe ground\nshook\nas more Gargoyles launched themselves off the cliff and hit the earth like bombs. They couldn’t really fly, heavy as they were—but they could angle their descent. Ryoka ran on as stone monsters twice as tall as she was landed around her.\nBirds shrieked in the sky, except they weren’t birds. Razorbeaks, the prehistoric avians with leathery wings and beaks full of teeth, swarmed down out of the sky. They dove down, seizing carcasses and entrails from the fighting monsters. Others dove at Ryoka, biting, tearing at her. She flailed at them as she ran on.\nDeath was everywhere. Ryoka felt it in every bite, every scratch. She was bleeding from a dozen wounds, and she felt like she was dying with every step. And she was confused. She was afraid—terrified out of her mind, and in pain. So why? Why—\nWhy was she smiling?\nThis was it. This was the end, and it was a stupid, pointless, and painful end. It was all her fault, and yet—there was a relief there.\nAt last.\nShe felt like…\nShe was bleeding.\nShe was leaving an actual trail of blood like movies.\nThe young woman laughed, but coughed and stumbled again. Her feet didn’t hurt.\nYou idiot.\nThis was all her fault. Just because she was so stubborn—at least someone was taking her to account. She kept stumbling forwards, just to spite the monsters. Spite was all she ran on. Not love of her family, not hope for anything in particular. Not family, not friends.\nGaria was going to be sad. Ceria had done so much for…\n—She got up. She thought she’d broken her nose, but the angry Gargoyle made her\nstand.\nShe kept running as another piece of stone embedded itself in the ground.\nShe had no friends nor purpose. Just forwards. One more step—\nA wild grin covered Ryoka’s face, twisting away into a grimace as she dodged left, a flicker of surprise as she saw the small, ragged piece of yellow cloth waving at the entrance of a massive cave. Her eyes were alight with life, and as she ran into the cavernous entrance that a Boeing-747 could easily taxi into with plenty of space to spare—\nShe was smiling. The Gargoyles turned and fled, the Razorbeaks peeled away, screaming in distress, and the remaining wolves and goats fled for their homes. Ryoka stumbled into the cave.",

    "text": "The Runner staggered into the cave, bleeding, injured, and sick.\nRyoka stumbled forwards and found the rough ground had suddenly changed. She was suddenly walking along…\nmarble?\nMaybe not marble, but some smooth, glossy stone had replaced the dark rocky ground. She left footprints in blood as she walked forwards, almost numb to the competing agonies in her body.\nThe monsters were gone. They’d stopped chasing Ryoka all of a sudden. She could barely process that, though. She was staring around. Around and\nup\n.\nThe cavern she’d entered had appeared large to begin with. But as Ryoka walked further into it, it was clear that rather than calling this place a cave, it was more as if someone had hollowed out the inside of the mountain. She walked into a massive auditorium filled with…stuff.\nThat was the word for it. Stuff. Huge, carved pillars flanked Ryoka as she walked further in. They gave way to tapestries hung from the walls, important-looking people and epic landscapes. Rows of\nbookshelves\nsuddenly appeared on her left, and then tables and countless pedestals holding things that glowed with magic and mysterious light. A huge table as long as a bus sat piled with pieces of paper and bubbling liquids. An alchemy lab, sitting next to a mirror that didn’t show Ryoka’s reflection as she passed, only a shimmering mist of strange colors.\nArmor and arms stood against another far wall, an armory among armories. Swords and maces shared places with plate armor and weapons Ryoka didn’t even have a name for. The cavernous room was filled with wealth. It was a treasury of everything and anything expensive.\nAnd standing in the middle of all of it was a man. Not just a man, though. Ryoka stumbled towards him.\nHer mind—\nWas failing. She felt herself losing blood, but she had to keep moving. If she stopped, she’d collapse. Ryoka squinted. It was so far to walk, but she kept going.\n…\nWho was he? Ryoka squinted. She felt like she was far away and close at the same time, so she lurched forwards. She saw—\n(A massive Dragon sat in the cave, staring down at Ryoka. His brilliant yellow and gold scales glinted in the half light as he raised a claw—)\n“What?”\nRyoka blinked. Her head—she staggered towards the man in regal clothing, clutching at her side. He was an old man, one with a veritable mane of silver-gray hair. But for all that, he was tall—taller than she was even. And his clothing looked like it was the most expensive stuff she’d ever seen, on par with Lady Magnolia’s attire.\nBut his face caught Ryoka. He was lined like an elderly statesman, but his features could have been used as a template for sculptures. He looked like the most handsome old guy she’d ever seen, and she was\nnot\nattracted to older men. But she was to him.\nHe looked like an archetype of humanity, only one aged well into his sixties or seventies. He was magnificent—\n(He was a Dragon. Yet his illusions showed only the man, and the Dragon’s head rose with the simulacrum’s, wary and alarmed.)\nThe figure had been resting on a reclining couch long enough to accommodate even his long frame. Eyes, sleeping. The head rose—\n(and so did the Dragon’s, eyes fluttering awake with alarm and fear. Then anger.)\nRyoka blinked. She was lying on the ground. She picked herself up and saw the blood. It dripped onto the expensive stone. She couldn’t feel much, but she saw the man walking towards her.\nShe wavered on her feet. The occupant of the cave looked at her: a bleeding, dying Human. In a state of shock, even as he seemed to wake from a long nap.\n“\nWho dares—\nwho are you?”\nHis voice echoed through that grand chamber, furious and startled, then surprised as he took in the blood trailing behind her. The holes in her flesh. The man looked up, and the young woman smiled at him, fearless and dying and…young. Like many such people her age.\nShe grinned at him and raised her hand. Ryoka held out the bit of parchment in a bloodstained grip.\n“Delivery.”\nThen she fell to the ground, unconscious. The elderly man looked down at the unconscious Ryoka Griffin and blinked a few times. How surprising.\n—Upon closer inspection, his ears were pointed upwards. If Ryoka had been in any state to inspect anything, that was. The ‘man’ sighed and muttered a few words that were loud and quiet at the same time. Ryoka’s bleeding stopped. He flicked his fingers, and the trail of blood she’d brought in slowly flowed together into a crimson orb that floated towards him.\nHe caught it and tossed it on Ryoka’s body. The blood flowed towards her and\ninto\nher. She stirred and sighed. He sighed too.\n“Humans.”\nIt was probably best to let the magic work. She was suffering from mana poisoning, which was far more difficult to cure than mere blood loss. Meanwhile, he could investigate this strange Human on his own. His spells weren’t showing her level or class for some reason.\nThe occupant of the cave turned and strode away. He made it five steps before he tripped over a goblet and fell on his face. Quickly, he got up and made sure the Human was still asleep. The elderly man scowled, kicked the golden chalice, and winced as it crashed into something in the distance and shattered it. He scowled at nothing in particular.\n“Rot.”\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "Erin left her inn three times over the course of the next two days. The first time she went out, she visited Selys, and the two had a long chat—lecture, really—about not going out and fighting monsters alone. Then they visited a bathhouse, helped Erin pick out more clothing, and went to see the ruins.\nThe ruins were about ten miles out from the city, but such was the traffic going to and from the ruins that it was easy to hitch a ride on a cart. Erin wondered why the mysterious ruins were safe to visit until Selys pointed out the countless adventurers of various levels congregating around the ruins.\nThere were at least a hundred mostly Human adventurers now in the city and in the makeshift tent city that had already appeared around the ruins. ‘Mostly Silver and Bronze-ranks’, according to Selys, which seemed to suggest that this wasn’t too impressive despite the numbers. But for all the shanty town’s size, it was dwarfed by the size of the excavated ruins.\nThey were massive. The excavation site itself was a giant pit in the ground—three times as large as a football stadium—that had unearthed a dark stone opening, a massive doorway into a crypt, or so Erin and Selys were told.\nThey didn’t go anywhere near the building. Few of the adventurers did either, and the [Traders] offering goods had parked their shops on the edge of the crater.\nApparently, the ruins were still filled with dirt and dried mud from years of being buried. Thus, adventurers were digging while fending off the monsters that lived within. Apparently, the place abounded with giant, burrowing rats—which Drakes did\nnot\neat, according to Selys—various types of the undead, varieties of spiders, and other low to mid-level monsters.\nThat was slowing up the adventuring teams, along with the sheer size of the ruins. But the main truth of it was that none of the diggers hired wanted to dig far in case they found something, and most of the adventuring teams felt the same. True, several had found small caskets of valuables, like silver and jewels, indicating this was at least partly an old crypt, but several of the more adventurous teams had advanced further in and never come back.\nOr they’d come back shuffling and moaning, trying to eat the flesh of the living.\nThat was the first visit, and Erin was lucky enough not to see any dead zombies—especially because she had a lovely lunch with Selys as they watched everyone mill about and not do anything much around the ruins. She attracted quite a bit of attention herself, being known as the innkeeper who slew Shield Spiders and, more notably, the Human innkeeper.\nSeveral Human adventurers came by to talk to Erin, but didn’t get very far with Selys glaring at them. They promised to visit her inn later, a promise Erin didn’t know if they’d keep when she told them she wasn’t serving alcohol yet.",

    "text": "The next day, Erin went out and visited Selys again, only this time, it was for business. The business of being paid, to be exact.\nErin happily held up the cloth bag and shook it. It made a dull metallic sound. She frowned, but the lack of any satisfying jingle wasn’t enough to get her down.\n“Money~!”\nSelys smiled at Erin as she put away the signed receipt under the counter in the Adventurer’s Guild.\n“Just don’t spend it all in one place, okay, Erin?”\n“Sure, sure. I’ll just spend it on important stuff. Like—\nfancy\ndust rags! Or alcohol! Or…a dress?”\nSelys eyed Erin sternly and shook her head.\n“How about a weapon? You could probably afford a good one with that much money.”\nAll told, the bounty on the Shield Spiders plus the fee she earned from selling their carcasses earned Erin just over eleven gold coins, reduced some because some of the spiders had been burned too badly to use. That was generally agreed to be a lot of money, but not a lot for the bounty on the carcasses.\nOne of the more senior Drake adventurers not currently staring at the Ruins leaned over the desk to talk to Erin. He was friendly and yellow-scaled, and Erin couldn’t remember his name.\n“You could have gotten a far better deal selling the spiders’ bodies elsewhere. Probably half again as much, especially if you went right to the right merchants. The Guild charges far too much for its service.”\nSelys glared at the Drake who had spoken.\n“The Guild pays a good rate for monster parts! If you’ve got a problem, Ylss, take it up with the guild master—or the council.”\nYlss flicked out his tongue dismissively.\n“The Guild won’t listen, and the council won’t either. But I’ve been talking to the Human adventurers, and they say their guilds pay them far better than ours does.”\n“That’s because\nHuman\nadventurers go out and fight monsters instead of their city Watch. If you want to negotiate prices, go slay a Shield Spider nest yourself. Erin here—”\nSelys glanced around. She spotted Erin with her hand on the door.\n“Erin, are you going already?”\nErin waved and smiled and opened the door before Selys asked if she wanted to stay. She did not, especially if it meant listening to another argument. Drakes were surprisingly—or was that unsurprisingly?—hot-headed.\nIt was time to go back to the inn before she splurged on everything. Erin only bought a few essentials from Krshia, a few more from other shops, fended off the Gnoll’s attempts to get her to have a cup of tea, and went home for lunch.",

They hadn’t ever been neatly organized in the first place, but the person—or people—who had visited her inn while she was away had tossed everything onto the floor and trampled it.\nThey hadn’t taken much. Erin didn’t have much. But they’d taken quite a bit of food, spilled the rest on the ground, and taken other of Erin’s vital necessities.\nLike her toothbrush. When Erin realized that was gone, she finally flipped. She grabbed the bag of her money—noting that the rest of the money she’d hidden in the inn was also missing—and stormed back towards the city.",

    "text": "Selys had to half-jog to keep up with Erin as the other girl stomped through the market.\n“So let me get this straight. You don’t mind monsters attacking you, but the instant someone steals from your inn, you want protection?”\nErin glared at Selys.\n“Yes!”\n“But they didn’t even steal anything important. Some food and a few coins—”\n“One gold coin and three silver coins!”\n“Why didn’t you hide it better? Or put it under lock and key?”\n“I don’t\nhave\na lock. Or a key!”\n“We can buy a vault or an enchanted lock and key if you want. I know a good shop—”\n“No. I want a weapon.”\n“Suit yourself. Here’s a good shop the adventurers talk about.”\nSelys pointed, and Erin made a beeline for the store manned by a burly Gnoll. He bared his teeth at Erin and nodded silently at her.\n“Erin Human. Greetings.”\n“Hi there.”\nErin smiled back at the Gnoll, showing her teeth as well. It was a Gnoll thing that she had learned. Selys just nodded at the Gnoll without showing any teeth.\n“I’m looking for a weapon.”\nThe Gnoll nodded and spread one hand to indicate his wares. Erin stared at a veritable armory of weapons on display. Most made sense to her, but only in the sense of having seen them in movies. They all looked sharp.\n“For a friend of Krshia, I will do my best to oblige you, yes? Do you fight with any weapon besides your hands, Erin Solstice?”\n“Um. No. No…in fact, I’ve never held anything larger than a knife.”\nThe Gnoll paused as he unhooked a devilish-looking scimitar from a weapon rack. He put the weapon back and nodded.\n“We have many weapons for beginners and self-defense, yes? Daggers, clubs…these weapons would be best.”\nErin stared at the dagger he carefully offered her hilt-first. It looked pointy, and the metal was polished until she could see her vague reflection in it. But that was about all she knew about weapons.\n“I’m not too sure a dagger would help against most of the monsters I see wandering around my inn.”\nThen again, she doubted even the battleaxes would help if she were fighting a Rock Crab.\n“…How about a crossbow? Do you have one of those?”\nSelys snorted.\n“Erin, those fire once. Ever tried reloading them? Not exactly fast—”\n“But they are good for amateurs. I do not stock them, but Drake cities make use of them. We Gnolls—less so.”\nThe [Shopkeeper] grinned, indicating racks of bows. Erin hmmed.\n“I can’t shoot arrows well. I’d like a crossbow. Would anyone sell them for…”\nShe showed him how much she had, which was a bad business move, but the Gnoll just peered at the coins and shook his head.\n“They are pricier than a cheap bow, Miss Solstice, due to how they are made. Especially good ones from the House of Minos or Noelictus. For what you have, an ordinary crossbow is possibly out of reach, let alone an enchanted one.”\n“Okay, no crossbow then.”\nErin sighed and stared at the racks of weapons. Selys tapped her shoulder and coughed discreetly.\n“You don’t\nhave\nto buy a weapon, you know. I keep telling you our adventurers will guard your inn.”\n“For eight silver coins a day per adventurer? And that’s for the lowest-level ones, right? No thank you.”\nErin shook her head. She had a better idea than Selys’ option in mind, and fortunately, it didn’t involve her learning to poke people with bits of metal.\n“Do you have any good short swords? Is that a shortsword? It looks short.”\nThe Gnoll nodded. He pulled a bronze sword that was indeed short off the display and placed it on the counter. Erin poked the hilt gingerly before picking it up. Selys hovered beside Erin, making sure the Human’s hands were well away from the blade. Both she and the Gnoll seemed more anxious than Erin was around bladed weapons.\n“You know buying a sword won’t immediately give you any classes? You need weeks—months of practice before you’ll learn any Skills. And I wouldn’t try swinging it around by yourself Erin, I really wouldn’t.”\n“I’m not stupid.”\n“No, but—”\n“How much?”\n“For you, two gold coins and three silver.”\nErin looked at Selys. The Drake nodded cautiously.\n“That’s expensive. But it\nis\ngood craftsmanship.”\n“Fine steel. You will not find better in the city.”\nThe Gnoll nodded and tapped the blade. He seemed honest, at least in that Erin hadn’t met a dishonest Gnoll yet. They were a bit more straightforward than Drakes, while Drakes were more like Humans.\n“Okay, how about a shield? A, uh, buckler? Is that what they’re called?”\nShe pointed, and the Gnoll brought out a metal shield rounded in the center. It was a tiny shield, meant to be held in the hand to deflect weapons rather than arrows.\nSelys objected.\n“It’s too small. Look, you need a larger shield if you really want to equip yourself. Which I still don’t recommend, by the way. And even if you have both, you’re not a trained warrior, Erin.\nI\ncould beat you, and I don’t even practice.”\nErin, the vanquisher of Shield Spiders, gave Selys a slightly indignant look. The slim [Receptionist] seemed serious, too.\n“I know what I’m doing, Selys. Anyways, it’s not for myself. How much for both?”\n“We do not sell many bucklers. I will sell both for four gold coins, Erin Solstice, so long as you promise not to use either without first being instructed.”\nShe grinned at him, her hands already going into her money pouch. It was a lot of her remaining coin, but Erin forked over the four fat coins at once.\n“Deal. But like I said, these aren’t for me. They’re a gift. Or maybe a bribe.”\nSelys was shaking her head as the coins changed hands and the Gnoll found a sheath for the short sword.\n“A bribe? For who? Who’d use something as small as—wait. You’re not thinking of—\nErin\n! No!”\nErin lifted both weapons into her arms. Even with her [Lesser Strength] Skill, they were\nheavy\n. She turned to Selys and copied the Drake’s exasperated expression.\n“Why not? They’re cheap, I know them personally, and they live around my inn.”\n“They’ll stab you in the back when you’re asleep!”\nErin walked away from the Gnoll shopkeeper, arguing with Selys as he watched them in bemusement.\n“They haven’t done it so far. Besides, these are the good ones. Well, sort of good. I already feed them.”\n“This is a terrible idea, you’ll see.”\n“No, it’s a great idea.\nYou’ll\nsee. And I could beat you in a fight, Selys. No offense.”\n“Erin, you really couldn’t. I had to take [Soldier] training—every Liscorian citizen has to be at\nleast\nLevel 1 for the army. Plus, my grandmother and my uncle gave me lessons. You’re good in a fight, but no soldier.”\n“That’s a joke, right, Selys?”\nThe Drake put her claws on her hips as Erin tried not to look amused.\n“Want to stop by the training grounds on the way to your inn?”",

    "text": "Half an hour later, Rags stared down at the shiny weapons Erin offered her and then up at the Human smiling at her. Well, sort of smiling.\nErin was wincing—mostly because of the bruises on her butt and sides. And scratches. Selys had given her a bit of healing potion, but even with that—\nWho knew [Receptionists] could fight dirty?\nLet alone fight with their\nclaws.\nNot just claws like a cat would scratch you, but a set of steel claws you wore over your hands, like brass knuckles. Apparently, Selys sometimes tested Silver-ranks, and she had given Erin a lot of scratches.\nThen again, she wasn’t here because Erin had kicked her in the stomach hard enough to make Selys lie down. Erin felt bad and good about that. Anyways, now Erin was proferring her new gear to Rags, and she was smiling expectantly.\nRight up until Erin realized the Goblin wasn’t taking the gear. Slowly, the small Goblin shook her head.\nErin’s face fell. She thrust the sheathed short sword at the Goblin, and the Goblin backed up into her bodyguards.\n“No? Why not? Come on, it’s a great deal!”\nRags shook her head again, and the other Goblins following her moved in front of her and barred Erin’s way. The far taller [Innkeeper] scowled at them, and they quailed a bit, but there were seven Goblins including Rags in the inn and only one Erin. If it came to it—\nThey’d probably run. But strangely, Rags was confident Erin would never try to hurt them. She was a strange Human, possibly a good one. She just had terrible ideas, like the deal she was offering the Goblins.\nShe was no longer the smallest Goblin. She was now Rags—and her tribe was no longer really a tribe.\nSome Goblins ate and slept in the cave, but most had left or wandered off. Rags was finding them and making them come back and eat in the cave—and gather blue fruits and hunt. The Chieftain was dead.\nSomeone had to be a Chieftain. Rags had kept the Goblins who listened to her fed. Gather blue fruits, make a fire, steal eggs, get the fish—Erin’s meals fed more Goblins. This…\nThis was hard. But Rags was now\nRags\n, and she had a new class.\n[Chieftain]. So long as she was one, her tribe would not attack the inn.\nHer\ntribe. But that did not mean…she shoved the hilt of the sword back, but Erin kept waving it in her face.\n“Look. It’s really simple, okay? I’ll give you these weapons and feed you guys as much as you want. In return, you guard my inn. Keep thieves and monsters away. It’s not a bad deal, right?”\nIt\nwas\na bad deal. While Rags was no eloquent orator, her own train of thought was quite clear. Her splintered tribe had been small even before the Chieftain had been killed. Now, it was in a power struggle, and Rags was leading the smaller breakaway faction who didn’t believe all Humans should be eaten on sight.\nMore than that, the small Goblin knew the Floodplains and was sure that defending the inn was a death sentence. What the strange Human girl was offering was a terrible deal. The magnificent weapons tempted Rags greatly, but even they couldn’t outweigh the massive disadvantages of Erin’s proposal.\nNow, how to explain that to an idiot? Rag’s brow furrowed, and she tried her best. She gargled a few syllables in her own language at Erin and then tried the language Erin spoke in. Neither worked. Erin just stared at her blankly, like one of the grazing animals—cows.\n“You don’t want the sword?”\nRags nodded. She pointed at the other Goblins and at the ground and then shook her head. She held up a claw, pointed at the sword and her chest, and nodded vigorously—then repeated pointing at the ground and shaking her head. Erin worked this out.\n“Okay, you\nwant\nthe sword. But you don’t want to guard.”\nRags nodded again.\n“Why? Is it because there aren’t enough of you?”\nNod, nod. At last, Erin was getting it.\n“Well—you could be tactical about it, couldn’t you? What if I got you a bow and arrow? That might be better than running around in a huge mob like you guys do.”\nThis time, all the Goblins glared at Erin. That was a valid, traditional Goblin tactic. Rags had improved on the formula by swarming in controlled bursts and incorporating devilishly cunning tactics like feints into their strategy, but swarming was what Goblins did best.\n“Fighting in a huge mob just doesn’t seem that smart is all I’m saying. But what if you all had bows or something?”\nAgain, Rags shook her head. She mimed shooting an arrow and then poked the Goblin in the head next to her gently.\n“Oh, not strong enough? Really?”\nNod. Rags really wished she could speak other languages or, barring that, only one Human could understand her. It was just as well she was a genius and Erin was bright enough so they could communicate this way.\nAnd it seemed like Erin got it. Bows were useful, but not as good as having many knives. Goblins’ shorter reach and weaker strength meant that they couldn’t fire as far or as hard as a Human or Drake archer anyways.\nErin wondered how strong you had to be to pierce Shield Spider armor.\n“I get it. Small arms and small bows, right? Size does matter. Too bad you don’t have any crossbows.”\nRags’ ears perked up at that, but the Goblin didn’t react in any other way, letting the Human girl muse on, oblivious.\n“I guess—well, yeah, anyone in armor wouldn’t be killed by a few arrows. But crossbows and longbows can pierce that stuff, right? But longbows—”\nErin eyed the Goblins. They were around four feet tall on average, and only the special ones like the former Chieftain got any taller. And even he would have had trouble stringing the massive longbows that could reach up to seven feet in length.\n“Life is tough, huh?”\nThis time, all the Goblins nodded. Life was tough. They were at war—well, Goblins were always at war, but this time, they were at war with each other. The tribe was small, food was scarce because winter was coming, and they only had a weird Human in an inn to feed them food in between running from the countless adventurers pouring into the region.\n“Well, I guess I could return these things.”\nErin sighed and placed the short sword and buckler on a table. She noted how all the Goblins’ eyes were drawn covetously towards the weapon. Drat. She’d thought it was a good idea, but when she really thought about it, she understood Rags’ predicament.\nBesides, when Erin stood in front of the tiny Goblin girl, she felt like she was still speaking to a child. Perhaps—perhaps she was. How long did it take for Goblins to grow up? How could you tell how old they were anyways?\nErin eyed all the Goblins as they seemed to confer with their leader, Rags. They were injured, most of them. They came into her inn every few days and ate as much as they could before waddling out, and they paid. But Erin had the distinct impression the battle that had started at her inn hadn’t ended with Klbkch. The Goblins’ faces were hard to remember, but some changed every few days. And Rags had her own cuts and scars on her body.\nThey were—well, they were evil, some of them. But the ones in front of Erin struck a chord with her. A sense of shared suffering, perhaps. And Erin had an idea that would help them and maybe her a tiny bit.\nShe stood up. The Goblins immediately looked up at her. Erin pointed.\n“Stay there. And don’t steal the sword or I’ll flatten you, got it?”\nShe walked back into her trashed kitchen that she still hadn’t found the time to tidy up. She walked to the back of the kitchen and opened a cupboard and stared at the jars inside. The thief who’d ransacked her inn hadn’t even gone near this cupboard or tried to drink what was inside. Very wise, given the contents of the jars.\nThe Goblins were all crowded around the short sword when Erin lugged the massive jar of Acid Fly juice back into the room. They were gingerly touching the blade and cutting their fingers on the edge when they looked up. When they saw what Erin was carrying, they immediately fled for the door.\n“Hold it!”\nRags paused and tripped up the Goblins behind her. They crashed into a pile, and she stared suspiciously at Erin as the Human groaned and set the jar on the floor. Glowing, green acid sloshed about in the too-thin glass walls of the container. A massive jar! Erin had heard this was for pickling fish or something, but she had a different use in mind that had horrified everyone who saw it. She rubbed her back and beckoned at the Goblin.\n“I’ve got an idea that’ll help us both out. And I’ll give you the sword and buckler, okay? I’ll put it on your tab.”\nThat did the trick. Rags was over caressing the blade in a second. Erin pointed to the acid jars.\n“You know what this is, right?”\nRags nodded. She kept a very respectful distance from the green, glowing acid sloshing in the jar and made the other Goblins stand even further back. That made Erin feel better too. She wouldn’t put it past one of them to trip into the glass jar, and\nthat\nwould not be a pretty sight.\nShe patted the glass jar.\n“Dangerous stuff. And I don’t want it. But what if I gave you some smaller jars? You could sort of throw this stuff at people, right? Not on Shield Spiders, though. It doesn’t really work on them. But other things—yeah. What do you think?”\nShe pulled out a small, Human-fist-sized jar and showed it to Rags. The Goblins blinked down at the small jar, and they looked at the bigger glass jar in sudden comprehension.\n“I’ll sell you these acid jars, and you can pay me, okay?”\nErin waited. Rags studied the green Acid Fly liquid mixed with the occasional fly body. She knew full well how dangerous the acid was. She was also impressed Erin was brave enough to harvest the Acid Flies, especially given how big some of them got. And the deal she was offering?\nThat\nwas a good deal.\nThe Goblin looked at the jars and saw a thousand different tactical options, not least of which was letting other Goblins drink the deadly acid if she left it out in the open. Erin looked at the Goblins and saw a convenient recycling machine that might pay her.\nBoth Human and Goblin smiled.",

    "text": "It was weird making a deal in sign language, but Erin had played chess players from other countries before. Even a deaf chess player and two mute ones. One of them had kicked her ass twice in a row, and she’d had a great time laughing with him over a stupid move she’d made—\nThe point was that she could communicate more or less with Rags. The small Goblin was extremely smart, and that was before you compared her with the other Goblins following her. They’d contented themselves with picking their noses and wiping their fingers on each other while Erin and Rags ‘talked’.\nEventually, the deal had been for Rags and her Goblins to pay several bronze coins per jar of acid. It wasn’t much, especially since Erin would have to buy newer, smaller jars for the Goblins to carry. But it was better than her pouring the acid out on the ground like she’d been doing. There was a huge scar in the earth outside of her inn that testified to how smart that idea was.\nBut it was a good deal. A great deal, even. It brought new revenue into Erin’s inn, especially since Rags bought all the jars Erin had in the inn and filled them up with acid. It helped her get rid of something she didn’t want, and it might help Rags and her band of Goblins survive a bit longer.\nIt was a good deal. It just wasn’t the deal Erin wanted.\nShe stared at the jar of acid. She could make her own acid flasks if she wanted. It was a handy weapon, even if some things like the Rock Crabs and the Shield Spiders were mostly immune to the acid. She had her fists and that [Bar Fighting] Skill as well as [Unerring Throw]. It was enough for self-defense against most of the monsters she’d seen, and she could run away from the rest.\nBut none of that helped protect her inn. Someone could walk in and steal as much as they wanted if Erin were gone, or they could hide and attack her when she got back. She had no defense against mobs of enemies, and she was sure a Rock Crab could level the inn if one got close. Seed cores wouldn’t scare away a swarm of the stupid crabs if something set them off.\nShe needed protection. Without it, Erin was truly screwed. And—and she needed to clean up her trashed inn, buy replacements for all of her supplies, and hope that she had enough money left over for—something. And that the mysterious thief wouldn’t come back when Erin was out again.\nNone of it was overwhelming, but for Erin, it was too much to deal with at the moment. She rested her head on the table, exhausted.\nKnock. Knock.\nErin didn’t raise her head off the table.\n“Come in.”\nKnock. Knock.\n“I\nsaid\n, come\nin.\n”\nNo response. The knocking continued. Erin waited for it to end, but the person at the door was persistent. First one minute, then five, the knocking continued rhythmically, without stopping. At last, Erin stood up, growling.\nShe stalked over to the door and yanked it open.\n“I\nsaid—\n”\nA skeleton stood in the doorway, tall as Erin—taller. Just a skeleton. Its yellow-white bones were devoid of any flesh, and yet it stood upright, denying biology and physics. Erin looked into twin burning blue-white flames that flickered in the skeleton’s eye sockets. The skeleton opened its jaw and\nclattered\nat her.\nErin shut the door. Then she screamed. Then she turned to run for the kitchen knives.\nOnly when she had turned did Erin realize she hadn’t locked the door. It opened, and she turned to see the skeleton walk silently into her inn.\nErin backed up. The skeleton advanced. It wasn’t attacking. It\nwasn’t\nattacking, but Erin was about to have a heart attack. It stepped towards her, and Erin nearly tripped over the acid jar still sitting on the floor.\nSuddenly, the skeleton raised a hand. Erin flinched and raised her hands, but the undead creature wasn’t attacking. It didn’t have…any weapon? And yes, it wasn’t striking at her. Instead, it held something in its hand.\nErin blinked. The skeleton held the scrap of parchment out to her silently. She took a step back, and it advanced. Not too close to her, but it wasn’t letting her get away either.\nShe hesitated. The skeleton was just\nstaring\nat her, although it had no real eyes, just the burning sockets in its skull. That was worse. It was waiting. She had to do something. So Erin took a few deep breaths and then reached out.\nShe took the piece of paper from the skeleton with a shaking hand. Erin edged away from the skeleton and swiftly glanced down at the paper, reading while keeping an eye on the undead monster. She blinked at the messy script, looked up at the skeleton, and then around. She glanced back at the skeleton and then got mad.\n“\nPisces!\n”\nHe appeared in the room, wavering into focus as his [Invisibility] spell ended. Perhaps he’d meant it to be a dramatic entrance, but Erin wasn’t impressed. It wasn’t nearly as cool as an invisibility cloak.\nPisces opened his mouth, and Erin stepped forwards and punched him in the face. Hard. He fell down, barely missing the acid jar. Quickly, Erin grabbed the jar and towed it into the kitchen before she or he knocked it over.\nThe mage, or rather, [Necromancer], looked up at Erin reproachfully as she walked back into the room. She didn’t give him a hand up, so he reluctantly picked himself off, brushing the dirt on his robes onto the ground.\n“That was most unkind to a faithful patron, good Mistress.”\n“Jerk. What the\nhell\nis that?”\nErin pointed with a shaking finger to the skeleton. It had watched everything silently.\nSulkily, Pisces pointed to the piece of paper on the ground.\n“I assumed my explanation would quell any questions you had.”\nErin seized the mage by the robes and dragged him face to face.\n“What. Is. That?”\nHe looked into her eyes and chose his words carefully.\n“It is a skeleton. An undead, animated skeleton to be precise.”\n“And why is it here?”\n“To protect you, of course. And to pay off my considerable tab.”\nErin let Pisces go. She stared at the skeleton and pulled at her hair.\n“Why is—\nwhy did—\n”\nHer hands twitched as she tried to stop from strangling Pisces on the spot. He backed up and straightened his robes, looking huffy.\n“Is it not what you’ve been seeking?”\n“You’re lucky I don’t throw acid on your face.”\n“Please, Erin. I am only acting in your best interests—and mine. Consider this undead warrior.”\nPisces indicated the silent skeleton.\n“Affordable, competent protection that needs neither sleep nor sustenance. I would say it is you who should be tendering your gratitude to\nme\n, Erin.”\nHe smiled, self-satisfied. Erin didn’t smile. She eyed the skeleton.\n“It’s for me? What, does it obey orders?”\nPisces looked mildly insulted.\n“Of course. I attuned it to you already. This skeleton will obey all commands and faithfully guard you and your possessions. Give it a command and see.”\nErin really didn’t want to. But the skeleton was standing too close for comfort. So she pointed to a corner.\n“Go over there.”\nImmediately, the skeleton turned and walked to the corner, navigating around the tables and chairs. There it stopped and swiveled its head, watching for Erin’s next command.\nSomehow, having a skeleton standing in a dark corner staring at her was even worse than having it right next to her. Erin shuddered.\n“I don’t like it.”\nShe ordered the skeleton to come back. It obediently walked closer, and Erin walked around the skeleton. She had to order it to stand still first, and then the skeleton stood, like the creepiest statue, in place.\n“Why did you think this was a good idea, Pisces?”\nPisces glanced at Erin, put out by the continued questioning.\n“I\nhave\nheard your repeated complaints about inadequate protection. And when I noticed the, ah, state your inn was in this morning—”\n“Oh, yeah! Did you do that?”\nHe raised his hands and backed away.\n“Not I. The culprit had already departed when I arrived.”\nThe mage’s eyes shifted. Erin wondered if he’d been the one to help himself to her coin—or more food. She growled, and the skeleton moved. It jerked into a low, fighting stance and faced Pisces of all people. He looked as alarmed as Erin.\n“Call it off.”\n“You’re the [Necromancer], you do it.”\n“I made it so it would only obey\nyou\n. Call it off or I’ll have to dismantle it.”\n“Hey, stop!”\nErin smacked the skeleton on the back of the head. She immediately regretted it. The feel of smooth bone on her hand was—\nThe skeleton swiveled around to stare at Erin as she wiped her hand on her shirt. She pointed at it shakily.\n“Don’t attack him. Unless I tell you to. Understand?”\nIt nodded. That was creepy. Erin shuddered.\n“It is a competent warrior that will fight for you. And I do believe that is what you need, unless I am completely in error.”\nHe was right, but the way he was right was completely\nwrong\n. Erin just didn’t know how to explain that to Pisces.\nHe\nclearly thought he’d done Erin a favor, and he was getting snippy in the absence of her unconditional gratitude. But then she noticed something else that was wrong.\n“If it’s some kind of warrior, shouldn’t it at least have a sword?”\n“Swords are expensive, Miss Solstice. And I am—regrettably—short on funding at the moment. Surely you could afford to equip your new bodyguard yourself?”\nAnd she’d just given the short sword and buckler to Rags. Erin ground her teeth.\n“Okay, fine. You’ve given me a pet skeleton. What does it do, exactly? Besides fight and scare me to death, that is?”\nPisces shrugged.\n“Whatever you wish. It will obey any command you give it, but, ah, its capacity for thought is quite limited at the moment. That may improve with time. I have made several improvements over the traditional undead animation spells—”\n“So it’s a special undead skeleton monster. Wonderful. And what happens if it breaks or goes nuts?”\n“The spell will not wear out. The body might in the course of normal combat though, it is true. I would be happy to repair any damage done for a nominal fee—”\nErin shook her head.\n“Skeleton repairs. That’s how they get you every time.”\nGlumly, she stared at the skeleton. Was it because she’d gone nuts or just gotten used to this world? She wasn’t half as freaked out by the skeleton as she felt she should have been. And what was worse, she was even considering keeping the thing.\n“And this is supposed to pay off your tab? All the gold you owe me?”\nPisces cleared his throat awkwardly.\n“Well, the price of an advanced reanimation spell such as this is traditionally worth—”\nHe cut off fast as Erin turned her head slightly.\n“I suppose a full repayment of my debts and some credit towards the future would not be too much to ask?”\n“It might.”\nErin stared glumly at the skeleton. It stared back, waiting patiently for orders.\n“Okay, let’s say I accept this. Won’t the Watch get mad?”\nNo response. Erin sighed.\n“And this wouldn’t happen to be a body belonging to anyone in Liscor, would it? But no—it’s a Human skeleton. Except—”\nShe frowned. Now that she looked, the skeleton didn’t look\nquite\nright. Sure, it had a Human head, but its ribs looked a bit different than the books she’d read in biology class. Come to that, some of the bones around the pelvis looked subtly different.\n“Hey, you didn’t rob a bunch of graves for this, did you, Pisces? Because if you did—hello?”\nScowling, Erin looked around. She saw no unhelpful mage, just the skeleton. Just an open door and a very noticeable absence of mage. He was gone.\nErin stared at the open door. Then she wondered if Pisces were still in the inn. Invisibility spells and all that. Quite deliberately, Erin walked around the room with her arms spread, trying to hit anything invisible and listening for sounds.\nNothing. He was probably gone. Probably. But Erin would be changing under a towel from now on.\nShe sighed, turned, nearly ran into the skeleton, and bit back a scream. It stared at her expectantly.\n“Go over there!”\nObediently, the skeleton walked away, but it turned its head, waiting for orders. Erin tried not to freak out. She could\nnot\ndeal with this. Even if it did seem like an answer, it was the most back-handed, slap-to-the-face answer she’d ever found.\nWhat to do? What to\ndo?\nThe first thing to do was get the skeleton out of the room, possibly out of her life. Erin stared grimly at the skeleton and realized she was going to lose any staring match.\nShe had an idea. Erin pointed at the skeleton.\n“You. Skele-thing.”\nIt stared at her expectantly.\n“Follow me.”\nErin walked into the kitchen, grabbed a few items, and shoved them at the skeleton, who had followed her.\n“Carry this. And follow me.”\nThe skeleton walked behind Erin, silent as a ghost. Its bony feet clicked silently on the floorboards as she made her way upstairs. It was a part of the inn Erin seldom visited for one real reason:\nThe dirt.\nIt was everywhere. And while Erin could keep the bottom floor of her inn mostly clean thanks to her [Basic Cleaning] Skill, she hadn’t even bothered to take on the upstairs.\nIf cleaning the common room of the inn had been akin to a short jog in terms of effort, the upper floor would have been like summiting the Himalayas back-to-back. Even the skeleton seemed impressed by the layers of dirt in the room Erin led it to.\n“Give me that.”\nErin pulled the bucket and old rag out of the skeleton’s hands. The days-old water slopped onto the floor, instantly dissolving several years’ worth of accumulations in a moment. She dipped the rag into the water, squeezed it, and then handed it to the skeleton. It took the rag and looked at it blankly. Erin pointed to the room.\n“Clean this.”\nThe skeleton stared at her. Erin waved at the dusty rooms and mildewed boards.\n“All of it. Clean it. Understand?”\nSlowly, the skeleton looked at the rag. It looked at the floor. It tossed the rag on the floor and began wiping weakly with its foot. Erin shook her head.\n“No! You take this—”\nShe grabbed the cloth and scrubbed energetically at the floorboards, removing a layer of dirt, dust, and black stains, which immediately turned the dustrag black.\n“—And clean up. See? Just like that.”\nThe skeleton paused and then tried to copy Erin. She watched, correcting, pointing out errors.\n“Scrub harder there. No—don’t move the rag like that. A smooth, circular motion. Like this. See?”\nAfter a few minutes, Erin was begrudgingly impressed as the skeleton revealed a shiny patch of floorboards underneath the carpeting of detritus.\n“Good.”\nThe skeleton paused and looked up at her. She waved her hand at it.\n“Don’t stop! Keep going!”\nIt stared around the room, confused. Erin shook her head. She walked to the doorway and showed the skeleton the other rooms.\n“See this? This entire floor. Clean it. Clean the floor, the walls, and the windows. Don’t stop until you’re finished!”\nErin stomped down the stairs, leaving the skeleton upstairs in the half-light. It stared down at the dustrag. Then the skeleton stared around the room. It was covered in residue left by moisture, open windows, dust, animal excrement, and rot. Even the ceiling was speckled or sometimes splashed with unfortunate stains. And this was one room of many.\nSkeletons couldn’t sigh. It was a lung thing, as in, skeletons didn’t have them. But the fires in this undead’s eyes dimmed ever so slightly. Then the skeleton bent down and got to work.\nIt didn’t level that night. Skeletons couldn’t become innkeepers. But it did have something in its mind. Something unique to it. Words that had echoed when it was first created. Words that no undead had ever heard before.\n[Unnamed, Level 1 Skeleton Warrior]\nIt wasn’t sure how it felt about that.\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "[Innkeeper Level 12!]\nSomeday, Erin was going to hear that annoying message in her head and jump off a cliff. But at least she’d gotten eight solid hours of sleep afterwards.\nBlearily, Erin got up and wondered if she leveled because of the skeleton. Something to do with the skeleton? Did [Innkeepers] level up from getting bodyguards? Or…bouncers?\n“Can skeletons bounce? Figuratively or literally?”\nErin blinked around at the room for several minutes. It was too early to think about complex things. She wanted a few things in no short order. Bathroom, food, and…that was about it.\nThe bathroom issue was hard. There were no real toilets in her inn. Erin had no idea why, but some shattered pottery upstairs and a terrible staining around the general area in each room made her think chamber pots had been in style here.\nErin wasn’t about to use a chamber pot. So she had gotten into the practice of digging (and then covering with bits of sawdust and dirt) a latrine around the back of her inn. It was messy, disgusting—and she really wasn’t happy about squatting in the open.\nSomething had to be done. That was what Erin decided as she finished her mercifully quick business and grabbed the roll of toilet paper. At least this world had something like toilet paper, if not as fluffy and easy on the skin. But the bathroom issue was bad. Someday, someone was going to walk up, and then Erin would die of shame or possibly stab them to death.\nOnce the bathroom issue was finished with, Erin could then wash her hands with what water she still had in one of her buckets and get breakfast. She was running low on water, too. That meant another trip to the stream, possibly combined with dodging flying fish if they were in a bitey mood today.\nAt this point, the thought of ducking a several-hundred pound monster full of teeth barely even bothered Erin. It was just another chore. She mechanically opened the shelves in her kitchen, wishing again she had the preservation runes. But they were expensive, and she ‘only’ had just under ten gold pieces.\nNot a bad amount of money to have, really. Most families might have that much stored if they were lucky, according to Selys. If a week’s pay could be a single gold piece for some—well, it turned out fighting monsters was very profitable. If exceptionally dangerous. Erin supposed that checked out. Regardless, it was a good amount for food—a low amount for anything magical. She wondered how much it cost to build an outhouse.\nAnother thing to worry about later. She’d put it on her list.\nErin turned, jar of milk in one hand, and nearly tripped over her sleeping area. She grabbed a counter to steady herself and added moving her sleeping area to the list. She really,\nreally\ndidn’t want to trip someday and splash boiling water all over herself.\nBut it was such a\nnice\nsleeping area. And it would be so much…some work to move it. Plus, there were all the handy knives and weapons close-by if trouble came calling again.\nShe had a lovely little blanket and pillows she’d used to make a semi-permanent bedspread in a corner of the kitchen. True, it would have been nice to have a mattress, but Erin had been counting her coins until recently. Now that she could spring for one, Erin dreamed of a queen-sized bed with silk sheets. She’d never tried silk sheets, but maybe Krshia had them…? Probably not.\nStill half-asleep, Erin walked around her kitchen, assembling a breakfast of sorts. There was actually a quite acceptable cereal that went well with the rich cow’s milk Erin bought. Sprinkle a little sugar in there and it would be delicious.\nSince sugar was too expensive for that, Erin instead sliced up some blue fruit into the bowl. That was nearly as good.\nFood, done. Erin walked out into the common room and set her bowl on the table. She pulled a chair out—and then noticed something was standing behind her. Slowly, she looked around.\nTwo glowing, blue flames in empty eye-sockets illuminated a fleshless head. Erin stared\ninto\nthe back of the skull and yellow teeth magically fixed into a permanent, deathly smile. A skeleton grinned at her, inches away from Erin’s face.\n“\nAaaaaaaaah!\n”\nErin screamed even as she punched. The skeleton caught a fist to the head and staggered backwards. It fell down. Erin clutched at her fist.\n“Ow! Ow, ow—go over there!”\nObediently, the skeleton got up and walked over to the corner. It watched as Erin waved her hand around and cursed for a while. When she was done, Erin marched up and poked the skeleton in the ribs.\n“Hey! I thought I told you to stay upstairs!”\nIt shook its head. Erin blinked and then got mad. She poked at the skeleton again, and her finger went straight into the rib cage. Shuddering, Erin pulled her finger back.\n“I\ndistinctly\nremember telling you to clean the rooms upstairs.”\nThe skeleton nodded. Erin glared.\n“Well? Why are you down here?”\nIt stared at her. Erin supposed it was just as well the skeleton hadn’t responded. She glared at the staircase.\n“Okay, wise guy. Let’s see just what happened while I was asleep.”\nShe stomped up the stairs, the skeleton following her close behind. Erin walked into one of the dirty rooms—\nAnd stopped.\n“Whoa.”\nSomething had changed. It was like one of those spot the difference games in newspapers, except that the difference here was\neverything\n. Erin blinked around at the spotless room and wondered if she was hallucinating. If she was, she preferred not to wake up.\nSlowly, she stared at the walls, the floors, and the windows. All were spotless. All were\nclean\n. She could even see the original color of the floorboards. Instead of their dirty grey-brown, they’d transformed into a lustrous golden brown that was actually pleasing to look at.\n“Okay. Okay, that’s, um—”\nErin turned and blinked at the skeleton.\n“Did you do all the rooms like this?”\nIt nodded. The skeleton walked over to a corner of the room and picked something up. It brought a bucket over to Erin and a scrap. She squinted at it. It looked—it looked like a piece of a dustrag. A tiny piece.\n“Where’s the rest of it gone, then?”\nThe skeleton shrugged. Erin wondered where the rest of the dirt and grime had gone. There was a sludgy substance in the bucket, but it looked like the skeleton had just tossed the grime out the window for the most part. Erin could get behind that cleaning style.\nAnd each room\nwas\nspotless. Well, there were some spots. Despite the skeleton’s best efforts, it still couldn’t clean away mildew. Some of the rotted boards still needed replacing, but Erin had [Basic Crafting] and a hammer. She was a god of minor repairs.\nThe entire upper floor was suddenly, miraculously habitable. Erin wandered around each room in a daze. She returned to the first room and wondered if the floors were softer here than in the kitchen. Well, the skeleton had done a good job after all. Erin wasn’t sure what to make of that. But the rooms\nwere\nclean.\nThen she had a thought. Erin looked up.\n“Hey! You missed the ceiling!”\nThe skeleton stared at her and then up at the still dirty ceiling. Erin scowled at it.\n“I said clean everything. The floor, the walls, windows…\nand\nthe ceiling. I said that, right?”\nThe skeleton shook its head. Erin scowled at it.\n“Well, I thought it. And you should have done it anyways!”\nThere was no way to tell if the skeleton was angry, sad, or…skeletons didn’t have emotions, right? But the flames in the skeleton’s eyes dimmed for a second as Erin glared at it.\nShe felt bad. Not because she cared much about the skeleton’s feelings, but because Erin could at least tell when she was being a jerk. She relented.\n“Okay. You did a good job.”\nThe skeleton seemed to brighten at that. It followed Erin downstairs. She sat down with a sigh at her breakfast and then paused. The skeleton was standing right next to her. She pointed.\n“Go over there.”\nIt walked over to one corner. Erin eyed the skeleton and spoke again.\n“Turn around.”\nIt did. At last, Erin was able to enjoy her meal without twin glowing eyes watching her every bite.\nBreakfast came and went, fairly quickly too. Erin was hungry, but she wasn’t savoring her meal like she normally did. Instead, she was thinking. When she was done, she pushed her bowl back and stared with narrowed eyes at the skeleton. Well. What was the saying about lemons and life? If life gives you lemons…burn down the lemon factory? Something like that.\nAnyways, it was time to get to work. Erin cleared her throat.\n“Hey, you.”\nInstantly, the skeleton turned around. She shook her head.\n“Get the bucket and follow me, okay?”\nShe got up and walked into the kitchen as the skeleton immediately ran upstairs. Erin was rich enough now to have more than one bucket, and so both she and the skeleton were equipped as they left the inn and walked to the stream.\nIt was a quiet walk. Erin told the skeleton to follow her further back, and she tried to ignore it mostly as she strolled along. Maybe she could have talked to it, but—no. The day Erin started holding conversations with skeletons was the day she finally snapped.\nThey got to the stream. Erin told the skeleton to thoroughly wash its bucket out first before they filled both up with water. It was just as well she had a bucket for drinking water and a bucket for washing water anyways. She’d deliberately marked both buckets with some paint to avoid drinking…whatever was still clinging to the bucket the skeleton was lifting.\n“Okay, let’s go.”\nErin reached for her bucket, but the skeleton got there first. It seized first the handle of its own bucket and then hers and tried to lift both. It strained and pulled, but it could barely move either full bucket more than an inch. Erin shook her head.\n“See, that’s just\nsad.\n”\nThe skeleton clattered its teeth together. Erin shuddered. She grabbed her bucket and lifted it up. It was heavy, but she was stronger than the skeleton.\n“Don’t do that. Take\none\nbucket and follow me.”\nAwkwardly, the skeleton hefted one of the full buckets of water and staggered after Erin. She walked quickly, trying to balance speed with avoiding losing too much water over the sides.\nShe was used to the trek from the stream to the inn, but her arm still vaguely ached by the time she got back. But ever since she’d acquired the [Lesser Strength] Skill, the trip had become far less painful. And this time, she didn’t even have to make two round trips.\n“Okay! Water’s done. Now, let’s get some food.”\nErin left the two buckets inside the inn, grabbed a basket, and walked off. The skeleton followed her obediently as the two walked across the rolling grassy landscape. They walked for about six minutes before Erin threw her arm out and stopped the skeleton in its tracks. It stared at her, confused.\n“Watch it. Rock Crab.”\nShe pointed. The skeleton looked and saw, about two hundred meters away, a large boulder slowly moving across the landscape. Underneath the large shell of rock, the skeleton could see massive legs slowly propelling the boulder around.\nWhen the skeleton realized what the Rock Crab really was, it immediately raised its fists and tried to charge the slow-moving monster. Erin had to grab the skeleton by one bony arm.\n“Hold it! What are you doing?”\nThe skeleton fought to run at the crab. Erin ordered it to stay still.\n“Don’t try to fight that thing! It’ll eat you. Or—snap you in two like a bunch of twigs.”\nReluctantly, the skeleton subsided. It stared hard at the Rock Crab, which ignored both Erin and the skeleton as it wandered off. When it had disappeared over a hill, Erin let the skeleton go.\n“Don’t be stupid. Come on and follow me.”\nThe skeleton walked after Erin. Eventually, they came to the blue fruit orchard. Erin showed the skeleton how to gather fruits.\n“See the basket? Fill the basket.”\nSo saying, Erin handed the skeleton her basket and sat down. Instantly, the skeleton began running around the orchard, gathering up fallen fruit and kicking trees to make the fruit fall. Erin sat under a tree and took a quick nap.",

    "text": "Having a skeleton was quite useful. In a few minutes, the skeleton had filled Erin’s basket to overflowing. It carefully walked back to Erin, trying not to spill the ripe fruits.\nErin didn’t react as the skeleton approached. She was sleeping. The skeleton hesitated and then placed the basket at her feet. It stood and waited, but she slept on. She was truly asleep.\nThe skeleton hesitated. It seemed to be thinking. At last, it turned and began scanning the landscape around Erin. Was it checking for threats? Erin couldn’t tell.\nOne of her eyelids had been cracked open ever so slightly as the skeleton approached. Now that it was looking the other way, Erin sighed inaudibly and sat up. Well, at least the skeleton wasn’t going to try killing her in her sleep. She’d had a terrible night last night worrying the same thing. But Pisces seemed to have done an okay job on the skeleton. Still, she’d keep an eye on it.\nIt was useful, but she still didn’t quite\ntrust\nit.\nErin clapped her hands together. The skeleton whirled around and then relaxed when it saw only Erin.\n“Okay, good job. Show me the fruits—actually, I’m gonna teach you how to sort them. Then we’ll go back to the inn.”",

    "text": "Erin showed the skeleton where to place the basket of blue fruits and then stretched.\n“Alright. Chores are mostly done. Now what?”\nThe skeleton stared at Erin. It certainly wasn’t going to come up with ideas on its own.\n“I could go to the city.”\nErin mused, eying the skeleton. She really didn’t want to leave it alone just yet, but there was a lot more to do in Liscor than here. She was wondering if she could give the skeleton a simple task—like gathering Acid Flies from the traps—when she heard the door open.\nShe and the skeleton looked around. Erin saw Pawn and two Workers step through the doorway. She smiled and waved at them. The skeleton had a different reaction. It opened its jaw, and the twin flames in its skull flared.\n“——!”\nThe skeleton charged Pawn and the two Antinium with a wordless, rattling whisper-shout. It was a sound that sounded like someone sighing, only far louder.\nPawn and the two Workers froze, uncertain. They backed into one another, but they were too big to slip out the door. The skeleton leapt at them—\n“\nHey!\n”\nErin’s fist caught the skeleton in the head and knocked the skull clean off the rest of the body. Pawn and the Workers stopped. The skeleton flailed around wildly. Then it stopped. Erin stared at it and groaned.\nOh no, she’d just broken the only magical tool she had! Again!\nShe was about to curse when she saw the skeleton hadn’t collapsed like she thought it would. The body was still flailing its arms, and Erin saw it twisting about. Searching for…the skull?\nIts head had rolled beneath a table. The skeleton’s body seemed to know where it was. Erin watched as it blundered over to its head, knocking over chairs and running into tables.\nThe skeleton picked up its head and placed it back on its neck. The lights reappeared in its eyes, and it stared at Erin.\n“Bad!”\nErin didn’t know why she was talking to the skeleton like it was a dog. She pointed at it.\n“You do\nnot\nattack them. Got it?”\nThe skeleton hesitated and then nodded. The light in its eyes dimmed. Erin stared at it another second and then turned to Pawn.\n“Sorry about that. I’ve got, uh, a skeleton problem.”\nPawn inclined his head.\n“I bear no offense, Erin. And I thank you for protecting us.”\nThe two Workers bowed their heads as well. Erin waved her hands.\n“No, it’s my fault. I just got this skeleton-thing, and I—sorry. Um, come on in.”\nAwkwardly, she stood aside to let Pawn and the other Workers file into the inn. They glanced at the skeleton, who was still watching them. Erin stalked over and poked at the skeleton until it moved away.\n“Right, how can I help you guys?”\n“We have come to play chess if you are willing, Erin Solstice. We would also purchase flies for consumption.”\n“Sure. No problem!”\nErin moved towards the kitchen and stopped. She pointed at the skeleton.\n“Stay. There. Don’t do anything.”\nWhen she returned with a heaping bowl of dead flies and blue juice, the Antinium had already chosen a table and set up a game of chess. Erin sat with them and began playing Pawn. It was a quick game as he’d tried a new move, which failed spectacularly. But Erin helped show him a better way to attack the enemy with the knight piece and let the other two Workers challenge her one by one.\nAs she played, she talked with Pawn.\n“What’s happening with the Antinium? Are you guys bothered by all the Humans in the city as well?”\nPawn shook his head, watching as Erin started collecting the Worker’s pieces one by one.\n“We work. We live. We die. All is unchanged among the Workers, Erin Solstice. But we hear of—things. Something happens below.”\n“Below? You mean where the Queen lives?”\nPawn hesitated. The two Workers looked up at him and then down at the board.\n“Yes. Our Queen moves. She is doing—something. We do not know what it is, but we sense it. And there is another Prognugator.”\nErin’s hand froze over a piece. Then she moved it.\n“Really? Another one? This Prog—this guy, he’s taken over Klbkch’s old job?”\n“Yes. He guards the Hive and watches. But no Worker has seen him yet. He walks above.”\n“Right. Um. Right.”\nDistracted, Erin lost a knight before she got back on track. She quickly crushed both Workers and then sighed.\n“Okay. Good game, guys. You’re getting better.”\nPawn nodded.\n“We level quickly. It is rare for Workers to level. We owe you a debt, Erin Solstice.”\n“Really? I didn’t do much.”\n“You teach. You help. You care. We know, and we learn from you how to be Human.”\nErin grinned mirthlessly.\n“Being Human isn’t\nthat\ngreat. But I’m glad I can help a bit.”\nShe suddenly had a thought. She glanced sideways at Pawn.\n“And maybe you could help me? I’d like to hire you and the other Workers—if you’ve got time. I know this is your break day, but—”\nPawn shook his head.\n“We would be happy to assist. What do you desire?”\n“Bathroom.”\nPawn tilted its head.\n“Bathroom?”\n“I mean an outhouse.”\nErin tried to explain. She pointed outside.\n“Right now I, uh—I have to dig a hole. Which isn’t fun. I don’t know if the Antinium have to go to the bathroom, but us Humans like a nice toilet seat.”\n“Toilet seat?”\n“…Never mind. How do Antinium, uh, excrete? Do you have anything like a bathroom?”\n“We have designated areas where waste is accumulated. We recycle such products within the Hive.”\n“Ah. Um. Humans\ndon’t\ndo that. Ever. And I’d really like a bathroom. Nothing fancy.”\nPawn and the two Workers nodded.\n“We are familiar with the construction of such facilities. It would be a simple task to construct one for you. I am a [Carpenter]. Level 1.”\nShe recalled him saying that. But hadn’t he told her he was Level 1 a while back? He hadn’t levelled up since? Erin had passed her first level on, like, the second day of the job. Antinium really didn’t level. Erin blinked and then smiled.\n“Oh. That’s—great. I’ve got some wood around back and nails and stuff. I can get more if you need it. Do you, um, need anything special?”\n“We are Antinium. Building is in our nature.”\nSometimes, it was really hard to keep the conversation flowing with Pawn. Erin cleared her throat awkwardly.\n“And how much will I owe you?”\nPawn hesitated.\n“We would not wish to charge you for this service.”\nAgain, Erin wasn’t sure what to say to that. She thought for a moment.\n“Tell you what—I’ll feed you and your friends for the rest of the week if you build it for me, no charge.”\nSince there were four days left in the week, Erin thought this was a fair offer. Pawn apparently did too, because he nodded.\n“It is agreed. We will begin at once.”\nAs one, the three Antinium stood up. They marched over to the door. Erin got up and then remembered. She turned her head and saw the skeleton still standing where she had left it.\n“As for you—”\nErin glared at the skeleton. It didn’t quite flinch back from her.\n“Do\nnot\nattack my guests, got it? Not unless they’re attacking me or doing something dangerous. Otherwise, I’ll have the Workers toss you in the outhouse and bury you. Got it?”\nThe skeleton meekly nodded. Erin turned away.\n“Okay, let’s get to work. Try not to get in the way.”",

    "text": "No matter how many times Erin saw it, she was always impressed by how efficient the Antinium were at…well…anything really. As soon as she’d chosen a good spot for the outhouse—just a little ways away from the inn where untoward smells wouldn’t be blown towards her—they immediately began excavating dirt and laying the groundwork for the outhouse.\nFortunately, Erin still had quite a bit of spare wood left over. And Pawn knew a good place to buy quality wood, so she gave them some money and let them go at it. She might have had a [Basic Crafting] as a Skill, but that didn’t mean she was good at constructing things. An outhouse was a bit beyond her capabilities.\nAnd apparently, the Antinium didn’t need Skills, at least not for something like this. They were just good at building things, and their bodies were naturally suited for tasks like digging and machining. Four arms were better than two.\nThe outhouse was a simple affair, at least by modern toilet standards. A solid wood building stood upright, shielding its sole occupant from weather and prying eyes while a small pit caught whatever fell down through the toilet hole. It was functional, sturdy, and that was all Erin needed at the moment.\nIt took them all day, but Erin supposed Workers didn’t need to be fast. Then again, was building an outhouse from scratch really hard? Pawn and the Workers kept talking about a foundation whenever she brought them Acid Flies for a snack.\nThe skeleton scurried around, pushing dirt out of the way for the Antinium, refilling Erin’s water buckets, and checking her Acid Fly traps. She had to explain to it how to do everything the first time, which was a major pain, but once she had, the skeleton remembered how to do it.\nErin had to admit—grudgingly—that the skeleton was quite useful. It was efficient, in that it didn’t stop to take breaks or complain like a certain Human. Thanks to it, her inn was fully ready when the sun started lowering in the sky and the evening rush began.\nToday, Rags and eight Goblins visited Erin’s inn. Then Pisces came by, full of his self-importance, the Antinium walked in and announced they were done with the outhouse, and Gazi appeared out of nowhere.\nIt was a record-breaking crowd that sat in The Wandering Inn. They barely occupied more than a fifth of the common room, although you wouldn’t know it, spread apart as they were.\nWell, it was only to be expected really. The Goblins might not be too afraid of Erin, but Pisces was just another Human to them, and Gazi was bad news walking. They stayed away from her and the skeleton. Erin thought they’d all run when the skeleton opened the door for them, but Rags had kept them from fleeing into the hills.\nThe Goblins’ reaction had been the normal one. Pisces obviously hadn’t batted an eyelid at the walking skeleton, and the Antinium just treated the skeleton with a certain wariness. When Gazi had seen the skeleton, she’d just blinked her massive eye and frowned for a bit without comment. Now she kept staring from the skeleton to Pisces as she ate, but she didn’t directly engage the [Necromancer] in conversation.\nSo all of Erin’s guests sat more or less in their own bubble. The Antinium played more chess, Pisces scarfed down food, Gazi watched, the Goblins ate and chattered amongst themselves, and none of them talked with each other.\nBut they all spoke to Erin. Or at least—the Goblins grunted at her, and Rags nodded or shook her head when Erin talked. But everyone else talked to her.\n“I noticed your new building. I take it is meant to act as a bathroom?”\nErin grinned at Gazi. She pointed at Pawn and the other Workers.\n“Yeah. They just put it up today. Isn’t it great? Now I don’t have to keep squatting in the grass. Ahem.”\nGazi smiled as Erin coughed and blushed a bit.\n“It is useful. Although I would warn you that maintaining such a spot can be difficult. You did well to build it away from water and your inn. I’ve seen many killed over fouling water, accidentally or not.”\nErin blinked a few times before nodding. Pisces seemed to be developing a third ear in his corner, but Erin just gestured to the Antinium.\n“Pawn told me about all the problems an outhouse causes. They smell. And they attract flies. But I think I can solve that problem with the world’s greatest cleaning fluid.”\nGazi raised her single eyebrow, smiling slightly.\n“And what would that be?”\n“Acid. I have more than I can use, and it eats through anything that’s not stone or metal or glass really fast. I toss a bit of that in there every morning and voilà! Problem solved!”\nGazi blinked again. From his table, Pisces looked up and shook his head.\n“Once again, your fascination with such a dangerous substance is alarming at best, Miss Solstice. I trust you at least have a few healing potions prepared for the day when you drop the acid on your person?”\nErin glared at him.\n“\nI’m\nnot going to be the one carrying jars of acid around. Too dangerous. I’ll make that guy do it instead.”\nErin pointed at the skeleton, who had just returned with another basket of blue fruit. She gestured to the kitchen, and it speedily walked inside.\nPisces stared at the skeleton incredulously.\n“Are you—making it gather\nfruits\n? And you want to make it clean your outhouse? You do realize it is here for your protection, do you not?”\n“Sure, sure. But it’s more useful helping out around the inn.”\nPisces scowled at Erin as she swept around with a refill of blue juice.\n“That is a\nwarrior\nskeleton, designed for combat.”\nShe glared back and filled his glass up with water.\n“It’s weaker than I am! I punched it this morning, and its head came clean off!”\nPisces turned red and gave Erin what she recognized as his prelude-to-sulking expression.\n“My creation is a work of art, but it must grow to its full potential first. It is not meant to be used for menial labor.”\nErin rolled her eyes.\n“Menial labor is about all it’s good for. If I sent it out to try and kill one of those Rock Crabs, it’d get squashed in a heartbeat. You’re a hotshot [Necromancer], aren’t you? Can’t you raise a Level 15 skeleton or something?”\nPisces shook his head.\n“I could certainly create a stronger undead—but not a higher level one. Do you—do you not understand the significance of this skeleton?”\n“No. Is it that special?”\nHe blinked at her.\n“Ah. Well, it is.”\nGazi spoke up. Her eye strayed towards the skeleton, which paused as it brought bowls of Acid Flies out for the Antinium. She murmured into her drink.\n“A Level 1 [Skeleton Warrior].”\nPisces nodded. Gazi blinked at him and tipped her cup in some sort of acknowledgement. Erin didn’t get it, but Pisces appeared incredibly smug and self-satisfied all of a sudden. Right up until he saw Gazi staring at him. Then he went white.\nYet all Gazi Pathseeker did was lift a cup to her lips. She addressed Pisces and Erin at the same time.\n“I would not mention that fact ever again were I you two. Either of you. Even that Drake would behead the [Necromancer] for this.”\n“And you won’t? I thought you were a famous adventurer…”\nGazi’s smile was pointed, and her large eye flickered to Pisces, who looked ready to run. Yet she just shook her head slightly, sending her braided hair swaying.\n“I do not care. If anything…it may suit me very well. Nor am I of this continent or Terandria. Mine is a different land, and I have known [Necromancers] and their kind. An accomplishment is an accomplishment.”\nThis time, Erin had to ask. She leaned over the table.\n“You said you saw people stabbed over fouling water? So your place is like—desert-y?”\nPisces snorted, and Gazi gave Erin a frown as if trying to tell if Erin was making fun of her.\n“Chandrar is not entirely desert, but my adopted homeland borders a vast desert, yes. Hence my familiarity with what this young [Necromancer] has done. But even Khelt’s King would call it extraordinary. If he did not behead that one for the deed.”\nPisces looked uncertain whether or not he should be sick or pleased, and Erin decided she should drop the topic.\n“Fine. It’s great. But I still wish it was stronger.”\nShe grumbled her way around the room, topping off glasses with her pitcher. Pisces looked relaxed enough to focus on his meal. Only after a good few minutes had passed and he was engrossed in wolfing down pasta did Gazi stop Erin again. She murmured to her as Erin passed by her table, and Erin saw her twisting a brooch that had been hidden in her armor.\nThe air\ndulled\nor felt heavy, and Erin felt a strange hush in the air. Pisces didn’t seem to notice, though Rags frowned at Erin and picked at one ear with a claw. Gazi spoke louder, then, gesturing to her meal, though her words didn’t match her actions.\n“So, how did you meet that young man? Where does he hail from?”\n“Pisces?”\nErin glanced at Pisces. He was smiling at his skeleton as it moved about the room.\n“Oh, he’s just this weird guy I met a while ago. He’s—well, I guess he’s a good mage. Does necromancy stuff, but the skeleton is the first undead thing I’ve ever seen him do. He also does other spells. Why?”\nGazi stared at Pisces, and then her eye moved away as he looked towards her. She nodded imperceptibly at him as she let Erin fill her glass.\n“He is—talented.”\n“Oh.”\nGazi nodded. After a moment, Erin shrugged and walked away. Really, what were you supposed to say to that?",

    "text": "About an hour had passed, and Erin was continuing to innkeep while her patrons ate, chatted, and, occasionally, used the new outhouse. Gazi didn’t do much from her seat, but her main eye kept following Pisces, the skeleton, and Erin.\nThen, as the sun began to touch the mountains and the light truly began to fade from the sky, Gazi’s main eye swiveled towards one window. She tapped her lips and then smiled again.\nErin noticed the half-Gazer getting up and leaving coins on the table. Gazi nodded to her as Erin bustled over.\n“Pardon me, Erin, but I must attend to some business. I will return shortly.”\n“Oh, sure. Have fun?”\nGazi smiled and left quickly. Erin shrugged and went back to serving. About ten minutes later, she heard someone knocking at the door.\n“Come in!”\nThe door opened. Erin turned with a smile.\n“Hey, welcome!”\nThe male, Human adventurer who opened the door smiled broadly at her.\n“Thank you. Me and my friends were looking for a place to stay and—”\nHe caught sight of Rags and the Goblins first. The adventurer swore and grabbed at this sword.\n“\nGoblins!\n”\nErin’s stomach lurched. The adventurer fell back, and his two companions—two other burly adventurers in armor—immediately seized their weapons. Rags and her crew looked up, suddenly tense. Pawn and the Workers froze in their game. Pisces was already gone.\n“No, no, wait! Don’t do anything!”\nDropping her pitcher of juice on a table, Erin ran forwards, putting herself between the adventurers and the Goblins.\n“They’re friendly! Don’t attack!”\nThe first adventurer stared at her. He was wearing a metal helmet that made his head look vaguely pot-shaped.\n“What are you, crazy? They’re\nGoblins!\n”\nHis two friends shifted behind him. One exclaimed as he caught sight of Pawn and the Workers.\n“It’s the bugs! And—a\nskeleton?\n”\nThe first adventurer was white in the face, whether with rage or fear it was hard to tell. He glared at Erin, hand tight on his sword hilt.\n“What’s going on here?”\n“Look, everyone chill! Calm down! These Goblins are peaceful. Didn’t you read the sign—?”\nThe third adventurer, a huge man who dwarfed the other two, turned red in the face. He growled at Rags and her Goblins, all of whom were standing, weapons raised.\n“Shut up! Those creatures aren’t\npeaceful\n. They’re monsters! I’ve lost good friends to them!”\nHe went for his axe. Erin grabbed his hand.\n“No, wait—let me—”\n“Get off!”\nThe burly adventurer growled and threw Erin off him. He shoved her back, and Erin crashed into a table. She blinked stupidly up at the ceiling as the world spun for a moment. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw a flash of movement.\nThe adventurers were moving towards the Goblins, weapons raised, when the skeleton leapt over a table, charged the first adventurer, and smashed into him. The undead skeleton was unarmed, but it just raised one bony fist and sunk it straight into the helmeted adventurer’s head.\nThe metal faceguard caught the skeleton, but it couldn’t protect the man from being bowled over as the skeleton rushed him. The undead kicked, and the sword flew out of the man’s hands. He cursed as the two other adventurers spread out. One of his friends pulled out his sword, but suddenly Rags and the other Goblins covered him.\nThe big adventurer roared and raised his axe, but Erin tackled him. She tried to pull his arm down, but he was like a piece of granite. He punched her in the side, and Erin fell off him. That\nhurt\n. Not as much as being stabbed, but she couldn’t breathe. He snarled at her, and then Pawn was in front of him. The Antinium swung two fists on his left side, and the adventurer stumbled backwards.\nThe adventurer on the floor cursed and swung at the skeleton, trying to get to his feet. The skeleton leaned back as the adventurer swung wildly. When it punched the man in the side of the head, he didn’t shift much. But the skeleton punched and punched and\npunched—\nThe helmeted adventurer caught the skeleton’s foot as it swung at his head. He growled and heaved upwards, and the skeleton toppled over. Then he reached for his sword.\nHis hand had just closed over the hilt when Erin walked over and kicked him in the side of the head. Down he went again, considerably harder than when the skeleton had hit him.\nShe looked around. The second man was fighting with the Goblins, slashing at them while they danced around the chairs and tables. He didn’t have any room to swing, but they had a lot more freedom. They lunged at him, cutting his legs, battering him with clubs, throwing plates at his face—\nA Worker crashed into a table next to Erin. It lay on its back, stunned, before it got up. She looked over. The big adventurer was fighting all three Antinium at once as they surrounded him.\nHe swung at Pawn, but Pawn caught both fists and then hit back with two more. The big adventurer blinked and then shoved the Antinium back. Pawn went flying, but two more Workers closed in. He battered at them, but the Antinium were far tougher than they were strong.\nIt was all a mess. Erin didn’t know what to do, but when one of the adventurers grabbed Rags and threw her to the ground, she moved. He stomped on her stomach once as the Goblin cried out in agony. Erin raised her fist, and then the skeleton smashed the adventurer in the back of the head with a chair.\nDown he went. Now only the biggest adventurer was left, but he was somehow managing to take on all comers by himself. He hit one of the Workers in the chest so hard the Antinium’s carapace\ncracked\nand then punched the skeleton into the ground before kicking the undead in the chest. Two ribs shattered as the Goblins swarmed around the man.\nErin hesitated and then ran inside the kitchen. She came out with a heavy object in her hands, just in time to see the skeleton crashing into another table, the axe buried in its chest.\nThe biggest adventurer kicked a Goblin several feet, backhanded Pawn, and snarled. He turned, and the flying frying pan cracked him straight in the forehead. Erin felt like she’d wrenched her shoulder with that throw, but her Skill had placed the pan right where she wanted it to go.\nThe fight was over. Erin still had to call the skeleton back and stop Rags and her Goblins from knifing the downed adventurers. The skeleton was trying to stomp on the helmeted man while Pawn and the other two Workers picked each other up and assessed their injuries.\nErin stared around the inn. She looked at her skeleton, with the axe hanging out of its shattered rib cage, the injured Goblins, the downed adventurer trio, Pawn and his injured workers, and then at her common room. Half the tables and chairs were splintered beyond repair, and all of her food and dishes had been strewn about the room.\nShe felt like crying. But the first adventurer was starting to wake up. Erin stared at the groaning men on the floor and pointed at the skeleton.\n“You. Bucket.”\nIt hesitated and then marched into the kitchen. Erin looked around. She walked over and picked up the frying pan.",

Instead, they were on the floor of an inn.\nThe three adventurers stared up into the face of justice. In this case, it was the back of a cast iron frying pan. Erin stood over them, flanked by a group of Goblins on her left and a Skeleton and three of the horrific ant-monsters known as Antinium on her right.\n“You wrecked my inn.”\nErin stared down at the three men. She was trembling. Half with nerves, but the other half was sheer rage.\n“You—”\nThe helmeted adventurer hesitated. He struggled to get to his feet, feeling for his sword. He saw it in the skeleton’s hands. He pointed a trembling finger at the skeleton, backing away as his two friends got to their feet.\n“What kind of inn\nis\nthis? It’s full of monsters!”\n“They’re not monsters! These Goblins are my\nguests\n, and no one hurts them here! Didn’t you read the sign?”\nThe biggest adventurer lumbered to his feet. His fists were clenched, and he was red down to his neck. Rags and the other Goblins retreated from him, but Erin saw Rags pulling out a jar full of green liquid. She shook her head at the Goblin.\n“You’re crazy! You—you freak! You’re feedin’ these freaks that kill Humans! And you’re feedin’\nbugs\nand an undead monster! We oughta burn this place down and turn you in to the City Watch!”\n“Burn down my inn? I don’t think so.”\nErin gripped the handle of the frying pan tighter. The Antinium loomed behind her, and the two smaller adventurers stepped back.\n“You\nbitch!\n”\nThe big adventurer shouted at Erin. His spit practically covered the skeleton interposing itself between Erin and him.\n“This ain’t over! We’re gonna round up all the adventurers in the city and come back here. Then we’ll see if you want to protect these freaks!”\n“I don’t believe that will happen.”\nSomeone tapped the big adventurer on the shoulder. He whirled around, threw a fist, and nearly screamed as a grip like steel crushed his wrist.\nGazi the Omniscient stared at the adventurer she had caught like an entomologist studying an insect caught in their backyard. Without much interest, she flicked the man’s hand away. When she turned to look at Erin, she smiled slightly.\n“Erin Solstice. You are full of surprises.”\nErin blinked.\n“Oh. Gazi.”\nThe two adventurers behind the big man reacted to the half-Gazer’s name—and her eye—but the bigger man was still caught up in his rage.\n“If yer gonna protect this monster-loving b—”\nGazi didn’t move. She didn’t move, but her eye\ntwitched\n. Its yellow pupil seemed to widen and glow for a moment, and Erin felt a flash of unease. Gazi was suddenly terrifying for no real reason. And she wasn’t even looking at Erin. The effect on the adventurers—particularly the big man—was immediate. They shuddered, paled, and backed away from her.\n“No one will attack this inn. Or I will find you and you will suffer. And you will all leave now.”\nHelmet adventurer shuddered. His eyes flicked to his sword, still in the skeleton’s hand.\n“But—”\nGazi’s eye swiveled, and her large yellow pupil fixed on the adventurer’s face, and the words stopped.\n“In the name of Reim—\nbegone.\n”\nThe adventurer stared for one second into Gazi’s large eye. Then he ran. He didn’t say a word, and his friends ran after him, legs and arms pumping. Erin watched them race down the hill so fast one tripped and went flying, but they got up and kept running even after slamming into the ground. Gazi just turned to Erin and smiled with her lips closed as if nothing had happened.\n“I am glad that you are unharmed.”\n“What?”\nErin blinked at Gazi stupidly and then realized she was still holding her frying pan. Lamely, she put it on a table.\n“Um, thanks. Really. You saved us there.”\nGazi flicked her hand dismissively.\n“I merely prevented them from causing more trouble. But you would have handled them most admirably had I not been here.”\nHer smaller eyes moved around the room.\n“Still, I see that they have caused much damage. I apologize. I should have forced them to repay you for the damages.”\n“Oh, it’s nothing—”\nErin broke off. Rags limped over to her, clutching at her stomach and poked her in the side. The Goblin offered Erin a bag of coins.\n“Oh. Oops?”\nRags shrugged at Erin and then winced. She clutched at her stomach where the adventurer had stomped on her. Erin immediately forgot about the money. She bent down, staring anxiously at the Goblin.\n“Are you okay? I have some healing potions I could split—”\nRags shook her head. Clutching at her ribs, she pulled something out of her pouch. A healing potion. The Goblin pulled the stopper out and drank a mouthful of the purple, brackish liquid.\nErin was sure the Goblin didn’t own any healing potions. She was also sure that it wasn’t her healing potion or Gazi’s. She looked at the other Goblins and saw they were doing the same with a few healing potions as well. She knew exactly where they’d come from.\nThe adventurers had come here with belt pouches and carry bags along with their armor and weapons. And while they’d left with their armor, it seemed someone had cut away their belts and bags of healing potions while they’d been downed. The Goblins were already fighting over the spoils.\nErin had a feeling that she was going to get the blame for most—all of that. But right now, looking at the injured people in her inn, she didn’t really care.\n“Here.”\nShe righted a table and made Pawn and the injured Workers sit down. Erin found some bandages in her packs, helped pull the axe out of the skeleton’s rib cage, and let Pisces get to work on the skeleton. It seemed he had been invisible during the entire confrontation.\nShe was so busy attending her friends—saying thank you and feeding them a second dinner—that she never noticed that Gazi had left the inn.",

    "text": "Gazi the Omniscient travelled back to Liscor, the ground blurring beneath her feet. She had no further business at The Wandering Inn at the moment. Erin Solstice was too busy attending to her wounded patrons for conversation, and Gazi had seen all she needed.\nMore importantly, she had found one. At last, she had found one. And not just one.\n“Two.”\nShe smiled to herself. She’d searched far and wide for individuals worthy of waking up her lord and liege. For years. And she had despaired. But now she had found one. Not just one; two.\n“A mysterious child with a unique Skill, and a [Necromancer] who can create new undead.”\nErin Solstice. She was unlike any Human Gazi had met before, save one. She had met only one other being who could unify so many races outside of her own. And that she had stepped in to protect them against her own kind only made her rarer in Gazi’s opinion.\nBut there was more to her than even that. Erin’s origins, her ways of thinking, and yes, even the [Immortal Moment] Skill Gazi had never seen on an individual before were all unique. She was worthy. The mage was also worthy, but in a different way. He was simply a genius.\n“But she is different.”\nGazi frowned, letting her single eyelid droop over her central eye. Yes, Erin Solstice was different. She passed through the city gates, nodding at the guard who stared at her and slowed to walk idly through the streets.\nErin Solstice. She was the one, and if Gazi had to choose, it would be her. But it was better not to choose. Better to wait and lay plans. Gazi could act now of course, but if she wanted to do this properly, it would take time.\nTime and patience were both things Gazi did not have, but she did not want to ruin things now, right when she had found not one, but two worthy beings. She yearned to begin, but patience—patience was a virtue she had learned to practice.\nYes, perhaps it was better to wait. She had come far over the course of thousands of miles and countless years. Her King still slept; he would wait a while longer to be woken. Those she brought must be truly worthy of his attention. Yet she had a good feeling this time.\nAt the very least, Fetohep of Khelt alone would pay a king’s ransom for Pisces—a [King]’s ransom a hundred times over. Whether he made the boy rich or had him executed—that alone might be enough to wake her King. Perhaps. Perhaps…though Fetohep had every reason not to want her King to wake.\nAs Gazi walked through the streets, she noticed she was being followed. She kept her main eye straight ahead, but her lesser eyes could detect movement around her. Gnolls. Two shadowed her at a distance, pretending to be late-night shoppers and pedestrians going home.\nNo doubt they were courtesy of a certain Gnoll [Shopkeeper]. She had doubtless organized them to tail Gazi, unaware perhaps of the half-Gazer’s ability to see all. Or perhaps she knew and was letting Gazi know she was being watched. Either way, it mattered little. The Gnolls were the least experienced of Gazi’s watchers, but they were hardly the only ones keeping an eye on her.\nPallass had sent their observers…for a time until they realized the cost was too high. They had their own kind of watcher, the Cyclops, though his role and Gazi’s—and their natures—were far different. She had passed through his realm mostly quietly. He knew better than to make unnecessary foes.\nBut it was the Gnolls’ presence that decided Gazi. Not because they were dangerous, but because it meant there was more to Erin than even her eyes could uncover. She would wait. Wait, and learn more about this strange Human. Perhaps there was another worthy one. Three was better than two.\nAs Gazi passed by the market street, she noticed a flicker of movement. A small Human grabbed several items from a stall while the shopkeeper was looking the other way. Gazi pretended not to see, but one of her lesser eyes tracked the female Human as she darted away.\nThe thief ducked out of sight in the alleyway, but Gazi’s eye wasn’t weak enough to be stopped by mere objects like walls at close range. Her large eye moved, and she saw not only the thief’s figure, but her name and nature. Such was the power of Gazi’s eye.\nBut in this case, Gazi was disappointed. She shook her head.\n“Ah. Just a [Princess].”\nShe turned her eye away. She had no time for Human royalty. Petty lords and princesses of small nations could not arouse her ruler’s interest.\nGazi cast her eye upwards. She saw the changing winds and, miles overhead, saw the cold front sweeping in at speeds even her eye had trouble tracking. Yes, winter was coming. And quickly too. This land had few seasons save for the rainy one, but the fell chill would still freeze the land for a week at least. Time, then, to wait and observe both Humans.\n“Yes, time.”\nThe adventurers had been a stroke of good luck. Their foolishness had given Gazi plenty of insight into Erin’s nature. She would ensure no reprisals came—at least in the form of a mob—but she would continue watching Erin Solstice.\nShe wanted to know\neverything\nabout her.",

    "text": "Erin sat in her inn, staring at the recently cleaned room. Half of the tables and chairs were now fireplace fuel, but at least the spilled food and broken dishes had been cleaned up. She’d buy new ones from Krshia tomorrow.\nEveryone was gone. They’d limped off or walked back to the city or, in Pisces’ case, done his disappearing act. They were gone, and Erin was left alone.\nWith the skeleton, of course.\nIt was fully repaired and sweeping up dust. Erin stared at it as it worked. It paused as it glanced up and saw her staring.\n“Yeah. You don’t like it either, huh?”\nAfter a moment, the skeleton got back to work. It stood up, dustpan in hand, and walked outside to dump the dust. Then it came back in and stood to attention, staring at Erin.\nShe sighed. The skeleton looked at her expectantly.\n“Skeletons. You know, I hated biology class in school. The skeleton there creeped me out, and it didn’t move around all the time.”\nNo response. Well, Erin was getting used to that.\n“I don’t like dead things. And I don’t really trust you.”\nThe light in the skeleton’s eyes dimmed for a second. Erin sighed again.\n“\nBut.\nI guess you’re alright.”\nThe flickering sparks in the skeleton’s eyes ignited. Erin nodded to herself.\n“I’ll keep you after all. You’re useful, and you can fight. Sorta. Just don’t do anything stupid, got it?”\nAfter a beat, the skeleton nodded obediently.\n“Cool. Now I guess—I guess you’ll need a name?”\nNo response. But the skeleton seemed expectant. Erin scratched her head. She really needed to sleep, but this was important.\n“What would be a good name for a skeleton? Papyrus…? Nah. You’re not nearly cool enough for that.”\nThe skeleton didn’t react. Erin tilted her head, thinking hard. She snapped her fingers.\n“I guess I’ll just call you Clatter. No—Claptrap! But even you’re not half as annoying as that…thing.”\nErin scratched at her head as she began pacing around the room. The skeleton’s fiery, blue eyes followed her as she began throwing names out at random.\n“Mr. Bones? Way too generic. How about Carnage? But that sounds horrible. Silent Steve…? No. Smitty Werbenjagermanjensen? Too long.”\nAfter a while, the skeleton turned around and walked upstairs. It still had the order to clean, and it supposed upstairs counted as ‘the inn’. So the skeleton began cleaning a decade’s worth of accumulated filth from the ceiling as it heard Erin still talking to herself down below.\n“How about Napoleon? But you’re not short. Skeletron? But I’d get confused. Paul Hendrickson the Fifth? Whitey? Wait, is that racist?”\nThe skeleton quite deliberately tuned Erin’s voice out of its head, at least as far as it could ignore the voice of its master. It scrubbed the ceiling with the fragment of the dustrag hard, wishing—as much as it\ncould\nwish—that it held a weapon instead. Erin had made it leave the sword and axe in the kitchen while it was cleaning.\nIt had no will. Skeletons weren’t supposed to have free will. But they weren’t supposed to level either, and the [Skeleton Warrior] was now Level 2. It didn’t know how to feel about that. It had one function: to serve. If leveling helped in that capacity, it would level.\nIt just wished Erin would stop talking.\n“Bojangles. Bonerama. Bonehead. Friedman? Spinal Tap. Harambe. Jack? Jack Sparrow? Jack Skellington?\nMr.\nSkeleton? Smiley Face?”\nA pause. The skeleton did not sigh in relief.\n“…Mike?”\n[Innkeeper Level 13!]\n[Skill – Loud Voice obtained!]\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "“Awaken, Human.”\nI’ve listened to my share of alarm clocks over the years. When I was a kid, my parents gave me an old-fashioned one* that I had to wind up constantly or it wouldn’t go off. First chance I got, I switched it out for a digital alarm and then my iPhone.\n*Vintage, which matters to no one unless you’re a hipster. And if you are, don’t talk to me.\nI like to wake up early to run—thus as I got older, my alarm clocks got louder. The one in my room I bought because my iPhone wasn’t powerful enough. It could wake up the house if I left for my morning run and forgot to turn it off. And my folks have a big house.\nBut no alarm clock or blaring fire alarm has ever gotten me into the waking world so quickly. The instant I heard those two words, I woke up. It was like magic*.\n*Probably because it\nwas\nmagic.\nI raise my head and instinctively brace for agonizing pain. I don’t feel any, which is alarming in itself. I should be in incredible pain—or dead. And if I am dead, who woke me up?\nPlease let it not be an old white guy who calls himself God.\n“Sit up.”\nAgain, the voice of whomever-this-is does exactly what it says on the tin. I get up without even realizing I’m doing it. I was lying on the ground, but now the world tilts the right way up for me. What’s going on?\nI remember collapsing onto the floor. On paved marble tiles to be exact. Paved marble tiles in the middle of a vast cavern, surrounded by a treasury/armory/mage’s laboratory/library of some kind.\nI’d like to look around, but my body is frozen. I sit completely still, unable to look around. I can see rows of dark bookshelves ahead of me, and then someone walks into view.\nThere’s a man—yes, a man standing in front of me. The strangest, most attractive—\nAttractive? Him? He’s an old guy with a beard. I\nhate\nolder men, mainly because they remind me of my dad. But this man—he’s different. Different from anyone I’ve met.\nFor one thing, he looks amazing in multiple senses of the word. His hair is a pale white, but not gray. Rather—silvery? It has a luster about it that makes me wonder if he uses this world’s equivalent of hair gel. But even the greatest beauty pageant contestants and supermodels of my world don’t have hair like that.\nAnd he looks like a model. An Olympian athlete past his prime but with the same body. He looks like the kind of person Renaissance sculptors would make statues of, but even David wasn’t this in shape.\nPlus, he’s wearing robes that look like they’re kin to the ones Ceria bought. Magical robes that look like silk and shine—except that his clothing is even shinier*.\n*I think my brain’s literally shutting down. This is wrong. People…a person shouldn’t be\nthis\nperfect.\nAnd then I look up and meet a pair of eyes that are blue in one orb and violet in the other.\nNo. Blue and violet? What, am I in elementary school? The colors I see are far deeper than that. I look into this man’s eyes—\nAnd I see a tiny bit of magic caught forever.\nIt should be impossible, but it’s like staring into one of those nebulas in outer space. The amethyst and azure—no, even those words aren’t good enough. When I see the celestial colors in his eyes, the words heliotrope and cerulean spring to mind. Fancy words to describe a wordless sight.\nThe colors shift together in his irises, exactly like the ever-changing colors of the solar clouds. Nebulae. The pupils shift towards me, and I feel like someone’s tagged me with a cattle prod*. I still don’t know how I’m uninjured or what this place is, but I can guess by assuming what\nhe\nis.\n*I don’t know what that actually feels like firsthand but—it’s like my entire body is being shocked, and not just in a bad way.\nA mage. Or maybe the word sorcerer or wizard applies here. Because if this guy is a mage, he’s an archmage or a magus.\nThe mysterious old mage-guy crooks one finger upwards at me.\n“Stand, please.”\nI push myself up and onto my feet easily, again sans pain or the gaping holes in my body I know should be there. Why?\nNow that I’m on my feet, I see I’m also shorter than this man by at least a few inches. And I’m six foot one. He’s tall, handsome, and even if his skin isn’t dark it’s—\nI blink for a second. Odd, I could have sworn his skin was white, but it’s darker than that. He looks…middle eastern? Yeah, a moderate olive brown whitened by a long time out of the sun maybe. But I could have\nsworn\nhe had white skin when I first saw him.\n(His scales glow in the light. The golden Dragon looks at me and—)\nNo—it’s the light. I want to look up, but the light is changing in the room somehow. It’s as if there’s a massive color filter over the room making everything appear different. Is there a massive mirror or something…?\nBut then the mage looks me up and down, and I realize something else is wrong. Namely, something is wrong with my clothes.\nMy flesh is healed, but the fabric is weak. And when a bunch of pterodactyl-type birds start trying to shred you from above and Gargoyles are spitting stone chunks at you, a wardrobe malfunction is sort of inevitable.\nOne of the stone shards must have cut me on the right shoulder, because my bra strap’s been sliced in two. That wouldn’t be so bad—except that an important part of my shirt is missing too. Right around the chest area.\nIt’s cold in the cavern. But the old guy gives my breast one dismissive look and sighs. He doesn’t even seem vaguely interested, which annoys me more than I feel relieved he’s not some pervert-sorcerer*.\n*Look, obviously I care about the dignity of women. Anyone whistling at me on the street I have an urge to throw into a trashcan. But when nakedness occurs, you expect at least\nsome\nkind of reaction out of any male, gay or straight or asexual. Even if it’s covering their eyes and turning away politely or staring like a monkey. But this guy doesn’t even blink. Even a blind guy would be happier to be told there was a naked woman in front of him. Respect is very important, but I’d like\nsome\nacknowledgment I’m more important than a rock.\n“Ah, of course. Clothing.”\nHe\ntsks\nand raises a finger. I’d really love to dodge or ask what he’s doing, but I’m helpless.\n“[Repair].”\nHis finger doesn’t even glow. Unlike when Sostrom repaired my iPhone, I can see no flash of magic. But magic\ndoes\nhappen.\nIn an instant, my bra strap slithers back over my shoulder and reconnects itself. I feel, without being able to turn my head, my clothing growing to cover the missing spots, sealing over in a matter of seconds.\nThat felt…\nincredibly creepy\n. But I’m happier not to be catching a cold, and the old mage seems happy too. He nods, once. Then he looks at me again.\n“Human, be silent and still. Do not speak or move save that I require a response. I will ask you questions, and you will answer to the best of your abilities, promptly and audibly. You will perform no magic and act in no violent ways while you are in my home.”\nHe pauses. Wow. Most people just say hello when they meet me or ask me if I want a pair of shoes.\n“Also, do not defecate, befoul, or otherwise sully this place in any way, shape, or form. And stand up straight.”\nOkay, I’m not sure what Humans he’s used to dealing with, but—my spine is already straightening. I can’t even glare at him. Crap. Is this some kind of magical hypnosis spell? But now he’s walking around me slowly. Eying me like a piece of fish on sale at a supermarket.\n“I care not about your name, but you are a Runner, a messenger, yes?”\n“Yes.”\nI tried to say, ‘yes, asshole’, but apparently no violence means no backchat either. He nods like he expected that reply.\n“Very well. But then tell me—why did you risk such a dangerous request? Three of your kind have perished already attempting to reach my home. What drove you to risk death for this delivery?”\nAgain, the response comes out of me instantly before I even have time to really think about my reply.\n“For the reward. Eighty gold pieces.”\nNow he looks disappointed.\n“Simply for that? No other reason?”\nHuh. Was this all some sort of test? Well, motor mouth, do your thing.\n“I took the request for the money, but also because I wanted to challenge myself. There are no other requests in the Runner’s Guild I could have taken, either. I am being blocked from other deliveries by fellow Runners, and this is the only request I could take.”\n“Hm. I see. How very mundane.”\nHe shakes his head. In\nmy\nhead, I’m sort of annoyed. It’s nice to know even an archmage former athlete can be an arrogant jerk.\n“Very well, then tell me: where do you come from? I have not seen features nor skin color such as yours on this continent for…a long time. Where were you born?”\nAh, now the hard questions come. But I’m ready for this. Well, not this obviously, but after meeting Lady Magnolia, I thought of the best way to deal with someone who can tell whether you’re lying or compel you to tell the truth. Either way, the only deception is in part of the truth.\n“I was born in Oakland, California.”\nHe pauses. A brief frown creases the mage’s face.\n“I am not familiar with either name. What nation does this Oakland California hail from?”\n“America.”\n“Hm. Another new nation. How troubling. The name feels more Chandrarian, but I suppose…well, a map should sort this out.”\nThe man strokes his silvery beard. Then he shakes his head.\n“I suppose it doesn’t matter. Now, I wish for you to answer this question freely, but also honestly.”\nHe points at me.\n“My spells of appraisal and identification told me nothing of your class or level when I cast them. And yet you are neither undead nor construct, and you are entirely Human. Why can I not see your class?”\nAt last, it seems like I can say what’s on my mind. I work my jaw and open my mouth for a few nice obscenities.\n“—”\n…Well damn. It looks like I still can’t just insult him, and I\nneed\nto tell the truth. Fine. I look the mage in the eye and talk.\n“I stopped myself from leveling. You can’t see my class because I don’t have one.”\nFor the first time since I’ve laid eyes on his face, the man looks genuinely startled. He tilts his head to peer more closely at me, and I notice that he has pointed ears. Oh. Of course.\n“You have no level? And you refuse to accept a class? Why? Fascinating. Are we back to this again? You don’t hail from Zeres, do you? No?”\nI have no idea what he means. I shake my head and, again, answer truthfully.\n“I don’t like being controlled. And I think—yeah, I think that classes and levels are a way for the world or some system to control people. I want no part of it. And—it feels like cheating.”\nAgain, I’m treated to an expression of frank incredulity. It’s the first time I’ve ever articulated my feelings as well, and even I’m surprised by my answer. Cheating. I guess that’s really one of the big reasons why I don’t like the entire basis of this world. But people level or die, which is probably why I’m getting the fish-eye from him.\n“You\nrefused\nto level up out of principle. Because you think…it empowers you too much?”\n“Yeah, more than other people.”\nHe looks fascinated by this. Suddenly, the man sits, and I see a shimmering chair made out of\nlight\nappear, an armchair, which materializes in the blink of an eye. As if sitting on light is normal, the man puts his fingers together like some kind of pretentious academic. Which he now sounds like.\n“But everyone is capable of levelling. The purest form of meritocracy, some call it. A few have considered there are benefits to doing without, but I have never met someone who denies levelling purely based on a disdain for its merits. You do not crave the power of Skills? At all?”\n“Well, I think I’m doing pretty good on my own. I’m in good shape, I’m smart enough, and I’m faster than Runners with Skills—”\nA guffaw escapes the old man’s lips so fast he catches himself. He laughs in my face—then stops.\n“Oh. You are serious. Incredible. Well, one supposes extraordinarily misguided egos do appear rarely. You have not seen what levels can do then, young woman. How very narrow your worldview is.”\nHe smirks at me. I stare blandly back because my face won’t work…but with inner spite in my soul.\n“Big talk for someone who doesn’t know where America is. Or Oakland or California.”\nCheap shots, I know, but it hits alright as his cheeks turn pink. That little bit of sass makes me feel better. He shoots me a frosty look.\n“Young nations rising and falling is hardly something to keep note of for someone of my lifespan…”\nHis hands go up, and he checks his ears quickly as if making sure they’re there?\n“…As a half-Elf. Yes. Philosophical inquiry into the function of classes and levels is far more pertinent to any discussion. Although—you probably don’t even know what I’m talking about, do you? That’s a rhetorical question. Don’t answer it. Of course, you don’t know what a rhetorical question is, either. Human education being what it is—”\nFor a moment, the mage’s eyes trail off. So he’s a haughty half-Elf recluse. From being the imperious mage he becomes something like what I’d expect an old, lecture-style college professor to be like. He gets out of his armchair and walks around me, talking half to me, half to the air.\n“You see, the rhetorical question was first invented by the Dragons. Only naturally. Of course, Elves and Dwarves adopted the practice, but it was Dragon-kind that first thought of a question that had no need for an answer. Elves were too in tune with nature; they\nexpected\nanswers to pop up, possibly from the rocks and trees they talked to. Dwarves on the other hand are literal creatures. If they ask you a question, they demand an answer. Humans on the other cl—hand…”\nHe broke off, shaking his head and sighing.\n“But I forget my audience. You don’t even know what I’m talking about, do you?”\nHe’s still an arrogant ass. But I get the distinct impression he’s also starved for company. Well, I can still answer back, so let’s see if I can’t continue this. Even if swearing is out of the question, I’m great at getting under people’s skin. It’s practically one of my Skills – [Being a Smart-mouthed Jerk].\n“I know what a rhetorical question is.”\nHe waves a hand at me and shakes his head pityingly.\n“Yes, yes. I’m sure you do. Ah, I’d forgotten how Humans exaggerate and lie.”\nDoes he forget I\ncan’t\nlie at the moment? I try to glare, but my facial muscles still aren’t working.\n“Would I really be that much of an idiot that I’d lie about knowing what a rhetorical question is?”\n“Well of course, I would assume—”\nPause. I enjoy the look on his face for a few seconds before he gives me a flat-lidded stare. Well, if I die at least I died doing what I do best. You can put that on my gravestone*.\n*Ryoka Griffin, 1995 – 2016.\n“Never knew when to shut up.”\n“Ah. I see that you are marginally more intelligent than the others I have met. Very well then, perhaps you will be able to answer my next question as well.”\nHe gestures, and from out of nowhere a map flies over and unfurls itself in the air. It’s a real map, old and dusty. I really want to sneeze, but I can’t. It stays motionless in the air as the mage shows me a map of the continent. Damn. I really wanted to see the world map.\nMr. Mage taps the old parchment with one finger.\n“I wish to know of any ongoing major wars between multiple nations, new technologies or spells developed, legendary monsters sighted or slain—import of that nature. Tell me all the news you have heard of in the past several years or so. What has transpired while I have been…secluded here?”\nOh boy, I’m going to love this. I give him the most casual shrug possible and spread my arms out.\n“Dunno.”\n“Excuse me?”\n“I don’t pay attention to world news. You probably know more about what’s going on than I do.”\nBlink, blink. Oh yes, score one for Ryoka Griffin*.\n*He’s still up by a few hundred thousand points, though.\nAgain, the mage harrumphs and glares at me, but his truthiness spell on me is working, and both he and I know it. He sighs, tugs at his beard again, and tries a different tack.\n“Do you at least know if Magnolia Reinhart still lives?”",

    "text": "“…Yes.”\n“Indeed, indeed. That is good. Well then, have you heard of a strange child known as Ryoka Griffin? She is a Runner, like you, although presumably high-level in the [Runner] class, unlike you. I am told her leg is currently injured or she may have been recently healed. Do you know of her?”\nOh gods. Poker face. There is so much I want to ask in those last few sentences, but—stick to the truth!\n“I know of a Ryoka Griffin, yes.”\n“Indeed? Do you know her address, a location where she stays at night? I have tried scrying her with magic, but either the name I was given was wrong or she is protected by powerful magic.”\nNow why the hell would Magnolia…? No, that’s a stupid question. I know the answer to that. But why wouldn’t he be able to find me? I don’t have any magical protections on me, not any that I’m aware of*. And how the hell am I going to answer? Ah, got it. Again, with the truth.\n*Note to self: have this checked out and buy something soon.\n“Ryoka Griffin—Ryoka doesn’t have a permanent place of residence. She moves around a lot, and she doesn’t stay in one city or inn for very long if she can help it.”\nThe old man sighs at me and shakes his head.\n“Very well, very well. I shall have to ask again for her true name, if that is the case. Although why Reinhart would have failed to extract her full name astounds me.”\nAha\n! I’ve got it. I know why he can’t find me with magic. He might be able to cast the highest-level scrying spell or whatever, but it’s no use if he can’t spell my name. Turns out having a dad who gives you a traditional Japanese name comes in handy once in a while. Ryoka. Trying spelling the\nkanji\non that one, sucker*.\n*Kanji, the written language of Japan. My name is Japanese, and although my U.S. birth certificate shows the English reading of it—Ryoka—my real name as given to me is 涼香. I’m willing to bet that he’d need to know that in order to find me.\nBeing stumped at anything seems to be a unique experience for this guy. He looks put out, at any rate, but then he turns his attention back to me, and I get the full intensity of his stare again.\n“Well, as interesting as this has been, I have no further questions for you. Runner, tell me, are you one of the better Runners in your guild, despite your lack of levels?”\n“Yes.”\nNo exaggeration or deceit needed there. The old guy looks unconvinced, but he nods reluctantly.\n“Very well. In that case, hear my request. You have come here seeking payment and a delivery. I will offer you your paltry sum, but you\nwill\ncomplete my request, sparing no effort to fulfill it, either by your own hands or ones more qualified. Is that understood?”\n“…Yes.”\nI really don’t like the sound of that. And I’ve got a bad feeling that whatever he’s going to ask of me, I’m going to be bound to do. A\ngeas*\n. Damn.\n*A\ngeas\n, or\ngeis\nif you prefer the Irish spelling, is a type of quest. Or…an oath bound by fate and magic. Look it up if you don’t know. Old myths and stories were full of them, and they never ended well for the people who took them on. Here’s hoping this one’s a simple task.\nHe points at me. I can already hear the silent orchestra in the background playing. Great. Why not add some wind and special effects to make it even more dramatic, old man?\n“You will go to the area known as the Blood Fields and locate the individual known as Az’kerash. Or—perhaps he uses his former, Human name. Perril. Perril Chandler, I believe.”\nPerril Chandler? That’s a far cry from Az’kerash. But since I can still talk, I guess it’s time to ask as much as I can.\n“Who is this guy?”\nThe man eyes me again, as if I should know. I shrug, and he sniffs and shakes his head.\n“He is a powerful mage. A [Necromancer], to be exact. But I believe he would be most easily identifiable by appearance. His hair is pale white, as is his skin. His eyes are violet. Although—he may use illusion spells to conceal such features when moving about. You may have heard of him as the Necromancer of Terandria and that he had passed away—he has not. Hence the\ngeas\n—the rest of the world thinks him dead, and I would not wish to start another continental war, possibly intercontinental, by making a mess of things.”\nOh fuck. Isn’t he supposed to be dead, according to the Horns?\nBut all I can do is listen.\nSilver-beard strokes said beard again and pauses. He seems to think for a moment and then nods.\n“I suppose the easiest way would be to go wherever the undead are most prevalent. He has an army. A fortress of the dead, to be exact. If you can make it here…well, you are the only Runner to reach even my humble abode, so I must take the chance.”\nOh fuck. Oh geez. Oh gods almighty and deceased tap-dancing on my unmarked grave.\nThat\ndoes\nnot\nsound like a survivable request.\nThe old mage is already turning away, but I can’t just take that and run off. I clear my throat, and he turns and reluctantly looks back towards me.\n“Speak.”\n“Ah. If this guy—Az’kerash is surrounded by the dead, how am I supposed to get to him without being killed?”\nHe looks annoyed at the question or perhaps my stupidity.\n“Naturally, his bodyguards will attempt to slay you. No doubt they regard all living beings as a threat. You must simply make your way to him, regardless of the peril. Besides, most of the animated dead are slow and easy to outrun.”\n“Yeah, but they have arrows. How am I supposed to dodge those?”\n“You are a Runner, are you not? Can you not simply outrun arrows?”\n“…No. I can’t outrun spells either, and I’ve seen undead mages. I won’t survive more than a few seconds if I run into a Lich by myself.”\nSilver-beard looks put out. He tugs at his beard again, almost as if he wants to rip it off.\n“Confounded hair—I suppose I should have expected as much from a Human Runner. Without levels. Very well. If that is the case…”\nHe trails off. Looks like he’s deep in thought, but I still have more questions. I clear my throat again, and his brows snap together as he glares at me.\n“Why can’t you just send the package or whatever it is with magic or something? Is it too heavy to transport? Because if it is—”\n“\nMagic\nis not the solution here. The one I wish to deliver a letter and small item to—he is shielded from location or communication from any form of spell, either malign or beneficial. As am I. I cannot discern his location nor speak with him save through the slowest of methods, which is why I requested a Runner. Also, it is the principle of the thing. I am not doing this out of pleasure, but obligation. Damned obligation…ahem. Thus, I will also require your return to report success.”\nEven better. I really should\nnot\nopen my big mouth.\n“I barely survived getting here. I probably won’t a second time. And if finding this [Necromancer] is as dangerous as it sounds—”\n“I heard you. Be silent.”\nWell, there goes speech. I helplessly stand and watch as the old man talks to himself.\n“This is why…Humans…it cannot be helped. Hm. A Courier would have been far more preferable. But if the issue is simply a matter of survival and speed, I suppose…”\nHe looks around. Then he points and beckons. From a corner of the cavern I can’t see, a bottle flies into his hand. Mages can use the Force. Who knew?\nSilver-beard holds the bottle out to me. I stare at it. It’s an orange—no, a glowing orange-pink mixture contained in a glass bottle. It looks like nothing I’d want to put in my body, but my hand reaches up to take it anyways.\n“Here. Take this as your fee for delivery. As to your fee for arriving here, albeit injured—”\nAnother gesture, and a shower of gold swirls up into the air and down into a bag he holds out in his hand. Despite the amount of money, the bag doesn’t even ripple as the coins flow into it.\nThe mage hands me the bag, and I find myself placing it at my hip.\n“The potion is a concoction that will enhance your speed greatly. Do\nnot\ndrink it all at once. A single dose should suffice for any monster, undead or otherwise, that you encounter. With it, you should be able to reach Perril Chandler more or less intact. Be sure not to confuse mana potions with health potions either. Your mana poisoning was most inconvenient to deal with.”\nOh. Was\nthat\nwhat it was? Damn. It all makes sense now. No wonder I wasn’t healing. But I could have sworn Ceria gave me the right potions.\n“Was the mana poisoning bad? If so—thank you, I guess.”\nSilver-hair raises his eyebrows as if surprised.\n“Mana poisoning? You would certainly not have died from the amount of mana you imbibed. Violent illness, fever, and uncontrollable bodily excretion would have been the worst you would have suffered over the next few days if I had left it alone.”\nWow. Suddenly, I’m really glad he took the time to heal that.\n“Was it intentional? If you were attempting to augment your body, I must tell you it was done poorly. A minuscule increase to your diet is the only way to properly acclimatize the Human body to magic. Not that I would expect modern mages to know how to naturalize magic within themselves.”\nOkay, if my ears could move, they would definitely perk up at that. And I’d love to ask more questions, but suddenly, my employer seems eager to have me gone. He shakes his head and flicks his fingers at me.\n“Regardless, do not injure yourself unnecessarily while fulfilling my task. Take this letter and this ring.”\nTwo more objects fly out of nowhere, and the mage hands them to me. The first is a scroll, tightly sealed with wax. The second is a small ring made of what looks like silver and an onyx gem. I say ‘looks like’, because when my hand closes over the metal it feels warm, and both gem and metal seem to be shining from within. Magic. It looks amazing, though.\nThe old man eyes me sternly and points to both items.\n“Do not wear the ring or you will suffer excruciatingly. The same goes for opening the letter, is that clear?”\n“Crystal.”\nHe eyes me again and shakes his head. Then he seems to waver, bits his lip, and grumbling, flicks his hand.\n“The Bloodfields\nshould\nbe empty, but—just in case, and in\naddition to my generous remunerations\n, I shall present you with this wand. It is a powerful flame wand for self-defense.”\nA crystal wand with what looks like red\nmagma\njoins the other objects. He hands it to me—but holds on as if reluctant to give it away.\n“Do\nnot\nuse it unless you are removed from your target. You understand? If you have no need of it on this trip—it will doubtless sell for some good coin. I trust you will do your best to survive. Retrieving my gift and message would be inconvenient.”\n“Nice to know you care. I guess I should just see myself out then?”\n“And waste time? No. I will expedite the first leg of your journey. Regardless of my healing, you will need several days no doubt to fully recover from the magic used and prepare for the journey ahead of you. Do not delay.”\nHe points at the ground at my feet. I nearly jump out of my skin as an intricate circle of countless interconnected shapes and runes appears at my feet.\nOh, apparently I can move now. But Silver-mane scowls at me, and my feet immediately shuffle back into the center of the circle.\n“What—what is this?”\n“A teleportation spell. Have you not—but of course, I suppose your mages are too weak for that. Now, where do you live?”\n“Celum. But hey, I can run back. The potion you gave me—”\n“Do not waste its effects. It is worth far more than the gold I gave you. Now, this city Celum—it is not too far from here, yes?”\n“Less than a hundred miles. Not too far, yeah.”\nHe seems immune to sarcasm. The mage strokes at his beard as he talks to himself.\n“Celum? Celum…ah. I believe I remember the general vicinity.”\nHe points again, and the circle glows. I wonder if he needs to chant spells like some of the mages I’ve seen. But then—this guy seems to be head and shoulders above every other mage, so I guess words are optional.\nAt last, the mage nods. The magic runes at my feet begin to glow brightly.\n“The spell will take you to the heart of the city. Go, and carry out my request as soon as you are able.”\n“Thanks for the encouragement.”\nHe waves his hand at me and then pauses. Reluctantly, he looks at me as the glowing magic circle at my feet begins to shine with multiple gradients of light.\n“I suppose it would violate the basic rules of hospitality not to inquire. So tell me Runner—what is your name? I am Teriarch. Speak it not but remember it, for what it is worth.”\nFor a moment, he looks sad, then dignified, as if he’s some fount of great wisdom and dignity in his hideaway. And I? I grin at him. Well, I guess I can go for one parting shot. The runes at my feet glow—and I feel myself being dragged away by something massive. I open my mouth and say two words.\n“Ryoka Griffin.”\nThen I’m gone.",

    "text": "Teriarch stopped and stared at the place where the Human known as Ryoka Griffin had just been. Desperately, he reached out, but even with magic, she was already out of his grasp. Short of casting multiple undirected spells that would teleport quite a bit of the city back here, she was gone.\nCursing silently in his own language, Teriarch berated himself for not observing basic etiquette. True, it was with a Human, but—how was he supposed to know it was that\nexact\nRunner who would show up on his doorstep?\nAh, well. He knew her face, and that would make her marginally easier to locate. Teriarch was still unclear what strange power shielded her from his scrying spells, especially since Ryoka had no magical power or even classes of her own. She was a strange Human, but now he understood part of Reinhart’s fascination with her.\nIt would be a truly problematic occurrence if she were to die delivering his message. If he’d known it was her, he would have given her another item of far greater ability. If she died, Magnolia would have his hide.\nThat was one of his concerns. The other was that either the earth had lowered again in the last few years or he’d miscalculated the exact coordinates of the city of Celum. To be more accurate, he’d been spot on in every geographical specification except one—\nAltitude.\nTeriarch winced as in his magical view of the city of Celum he saw Ryoka appear. She was more or less in the center of the city as he’d claimed, but she was definitely too high up. He watched her plummet down out of the sky from roof-height.\n“Oops. Ah, well. This is why Humans use healing potions after all.”\nHe turned. Ryoka would live, and he was busy. Busy and annoyed at having to do work after so soon. He didn’t think long on Ryoka. Magnolia could have what she wanted, but he—\nHe was aloof. Separate. He didn’t think to ask what had driven her to run almost to her death here. Because he didn’t care. He had done his duty in regards to Perril Chandler, distasteful as such things were. Duty, obligation—and a bit of work before he could rest once more. The old man strode off to take care of the work that had built up.\nTeriarch made it a few steps and then tripped again. This time, it was over his robes. He growled.\n“Flayed scales and hoard blight!”\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "Ryoka sat in an inn and munched on her potatoes and stewed meat. She felt guilty about it, but the dinner menu hadn’t exactly been diverse with options, and she was hungry. Still, she felt guilty.\nHer plate was about 80% potato and 20% meat. And it wasn’t great meat at that. The potatoes actually weren’t that bad—the people here spiced them up pretty strong with their unique blend of peppers and herbs, so they were palatable, but it was definitely\nnot\nthe kind of meal a healthy runner should eat.\nPlus, this was her second plate. The guilt was real, but Ryoka couldn’t do much about it. She took another bite of the steaming potatoes and tried not to think about dieting or proper nutritional intake.\nNormally, she avoided carbo-loading unless she was actually going to run a race but…she deserved a treat. Besides, she\nwas\nofficially resting at the moment after all the healing she’d been doing. And again, the inn wasn’t serving anything else, so she had to make do.\nPotatoes and meat, with a lot more gristle than she was used to. Still, it tasted good, and she was used to rugged fare, especially when she went camping.\nNot modern-day camping, either. Ryoka disdained people who slept in their own car or, worse, in a huge trailer they towed to campsites. No, she preferred roughing it with a sleeping bag, enough food for a few days, and the bare essentials. That was living.\nBut she had to admit, it would be nice to have a hamburger once in a while. And fresh vegetables like kale. Right now, harvest season had passed and it was late fall (although it certainly didn’t feel that cold), and vegetables were in shorter supply.\nMore meat, more vegetables, a lot fewer carbs. That would be better. But you got what you paid for. Ryoka sighed and ate another chunk of potato. It wasn’t bad. It just wasn’t great either. At least someone else was enjoying her meal.\nGaria finished her third plate of potatoes and meat and took a deep draft from her mug before sighing contentedly. She had a good appetite. Well, she would. Ryoka surreptitiously eyed Garia’s arms and body. She might not have a six pack, but Ryoka hadn’t seen arms that thick on another girl outside of an MMA tournament.\nNot that she was muscled like those idiots who used steroids. Garia was just a heavier girl, one who clearly was used to heavy lifting.\n“Do you always do the heaviest deliveries possible?”\nGaria paused as she raised her mug to her lips.\n“Um, yes. Normally. I mean, I’m not too fast, but I can still earn quite a lot on an overnight delivery.”\nRyoka was trying to pretend her shoulders didn’t hurt. Which they did.\nImmensely.\nThe strain from hauling that much weight…and Garia seemed fine. So Ryoka was fine. Fuck you.\nShe was so fine—\nshe coughed as she reached for a cup of water.\n“Those spices you carried here. All the way from Wales. They were heavy. I saw the size of your pack. Must have been sixty, eight pounds of weight. And you jogged the entire way here?”\nGaria shifted and blushed a bit.\n“Well, if you distribute the weight properly, it’s not that bad. And sometimes I walk a bit if I get tired.”\n“Hm. Impressive.”\nHoly shit you’re amazing.\nBut that part didn’t come out. Just a grunt—and Garia’s look of pleasure and blush made Ryoka feel so guilty she pretended she didn’t see it.\nRyoka bit into another potato and eyed the browned onions as Garia turned red. She clearly wasn’t used to praise, but Ryoka was impressed by anyone who could run with that much weight.\n“The Runner’s Guild requests are a mix between fast deliveries, safe deliveries, and heavy deliveries, right?”\n“That’s right. Most deliveries people want fast over long distances, like the ones you take. But sometimes they want to make sure no one reads their message, so that’s important too. But when they need something delivered quickly—well, faster than by cart or wagon and it’s small enough—we get the heavy requests. I take those most of the time. It’s safe. No one wants to steal raw ore or a few bags of sugar. The most expensive stuff I carry are weapons and spices.”\n“Hm.”\nRyoka wondered just how efficient Runners were compared to a wagon. But then, she’d seen the traffic jams that occurred in cities and how muddy the roads could get. Runners might be expensive, but if you needed something\nnow,\nthey were your only real option.\nAs Ryoka lifted her fork to her mouth, she glanced up and saw a man staring at her across the room. He immediately glanced back down at his plate as their eyes met, but he was far from the only one. Several other men and women of various ages glanced away or, in a few cases, met Ryoka’s gaze as she looked around the room. Even the barmaids eyed her surreptitiously as they delivered another plate of food for Garia.\nRyoka scowled. Garia noticed the other Runner’s expression and realized what was making Ryoka unhappy.\n“They’re just interested, Ryoka. There’s no need to look like that.”\n“If they’re so interested, they can come over and talk or they can bugger off.”\nGaria blinked. Sometimes, Ryoka used the strangest expressions when she talked, but Garia could usually understand what she meant. The glare Ryoka leveled at her watchers was unmistakable, though. Garia tried to sound reasonable.\n“Well, can you blame them? I mean, you\nare\nthe only Runner to survive the High Passes for years—and without a scratch at that! And when you\nfell\nout of the sky—”\n“Don’t remind me.”\nRyoka scowled down at her plate and tried not to remember. Her back still\nached\n, even though the healing potions had done their work. Shoulders ache, back ache…headache. At least she hadn’t broken anything again or landed on her head.\n“Damn elfish mage bastard.”\n“What?”\n“Nothing. Anyways, I didn’t get out unscathed. I got torn up on the way in, and I needed serious healing or I would have died.”\n“Oh, so you found a healing potion? Ceria was so worried when she realized she’d given you the mana potions.”\n“…Something like that. And it’s odd. I could have sworn she gave me healing potions too.”\n“She’s really,\nreally\nsorry, you know.”\n“I know. Anyways, it’s both our faults for not double-checking.”\nRyoka scowled at her half-finished plate. Garia fidgeted, clearly wanting to clear Ceria’s name\n“She said she tried to contact you several times. Didn’t you, um, notice?”\nRyoka glared harder at her innocent plate. She tried not to let her voice get too defensive, but it was hard.\n“How was I supposed to know I was supposed to touch those damn fireflies to speak with her? I thought I was being hexed or something.”\n“Oh, no. That’s the way students at Wistram Academy communicate apparently. Ceria doesn’t know other spells so…”\n“I get it. I’m not mad at her. Anyways, I survived. It all worked out.”\nExcept of course that she had more problems than she’d started out with. Ryoka could still feel Teriarch’s words burning in the back of her mind. But she could ignore them, so long as she reminded herself she still needed to prepare. The strange potion he’d given her was locked in Ryoka’s chest upstairs.\n“Come to that, where\nis\nCeria? I haven’t seen her. I’d have assumed she’d be right here along with Gerial and Calruz.”\nGaria shook her head.\n“They’re all out of the city. Calruz came by and gathered all the members. Apparently, they’re going to Esthelm to prepare to enter the ruins in Liscor.”\n“Oh.”\nRyoka’s expression didn’t alter noticeably, but she swore internally. She raised her mug to her lips, opened her mouth to ask another question, and this time swore externally.\n“Damnit.”\nFals walked across the inn, flashing a smile at one of the barmaids and clasping hands with someone he recognized. He stopped at Ryoka’s table and hesitated. There were three chairs, but Ryoka’s foot had magically appeared in the third seat.\n“Ryoka, how are you? I was hoping I could talk to you!”\n“Were you?”\nRyoka stared as Fals dragged up another chair and sat next to Garia, who blushed and edged away from him. Ryoka wasn’t quite glaring—mainly because Garia was kicking her none-too-gently in the shins and trying to get her to play nice. She didn’t feel like playing nice.\n“I just wanted to congratulate you on your delivery. Everyone in the city’s talking about it.”\n“Good for them.”\nGaria glared, and Ryoka toned down the rampant hostility in her voice. Fals cleared his throat, looking abashed.\n“Look, I’m, ah, sorry about earlier. We didn’t part on the best of terms, did we?”\nRyoka stared. Fals hesitated and then went on.\n“The Guild—and I—would like to apologize. Clearly, you’re a great Runner, and we’d hate to lose you. We’ll talk to Magnolia, and if you’d like to take on more requests, we’ll be happy to let you take any one you want.”\nMentally, Ryoka translated his statement. Since she’d won and defied Magnolia, she had stopped blocking Ryoka. Or the Guild wanted a share of her delivery and was willing to flip Magnolia off because they’d had enough of her bossing them around. Well, she could live with that. And so would the Guild.\nShe didn’t respond, though. Instead, Ryoka slowly and deliberately took a big bite of potato and chewed slowly as she stared down Fals. It was awkward as hell, but she enjoyed his discomfort.\nFals cleared his throat and glanced at Garia, but the other girl was trying not to make eye contact with him and wolfing down her food.\n“So, um, how were the High Passes? Did you see a lot of monsters, or were you able to outrun them?”\n“Saw a lot of monsters. Nasty ones.”\n“Really?”\n“Yep.”\n“…Any interesting ones?”\nRyoka shrugged.\n“Gargoyles, birds with teeth, killer goats, and wolf packs. You’d love it there.”\n“Ah. Well—well done on avoiding them. What about the client? I take it you got the request from him in person, right? What was he like? Or is it a she?”\nGaria looked up, curious. Ryoka glanced around. She felt like several nearby patrons on each table were listening. She nodded to herself and then looked at Fals.\n“Confidential.”\n“Ah.”\nThe conversation stalled. Well, it hadn’t really been going that well in the first place, and Ryoka bluntly shot down all of Fals’ attempts to ask about the High Passes or her delivery. At last, he leaned forwards and gave Ryoka his most charming smile.\n“I know you’re still recuperating, but I’d love to go on a delivery with you sometime. Maybe you, me, and Garia could do a request?”\n“Maybe.”\nThat was Ryoka’s way of saying no, and all three Runners knew it. Fals didn’t falter though.\n“Is there, um, anything I can do for you? I know you’re probably still mad, but I’d love to make it up to you. Would you, say, let me buy you a few drinks?”\nRyoka thought about this while Garia tried to signal her to say ‘yes’ covertly. She nodded at last.\n“There is something you can do.”\nFals smiled in relief. He exhaled, and his head rose—it had been sinking progressively with each rejection. He gave Ryoka a huge, expectant smile.\n“Really? Well then, what is it?”\nRyoka nodded, deadpan.\n“You can clear out. I’m talking to Garia.”\nHe blinked at her while Garia groaned audibly. Fals tried to smile it off, but Ryoka’s expression was still deadpan. After a few seconds, he stood up awkwardly.\n“Well, ah, I’ll be going. It was nice talking to you, Ryoka. And I’ll see you around, Garia.”\nHe walked around the table and paused for only a second by Ryoka. She heard him whisper just loud enough so she could hear it.\n“Watch yourself. Persua left the Guild with her group this morning. She’ll probably try something. Even if the Guild’s watching her—she’s gone mad.”\nShe glanced up. Fals gave her a Gallic shrug and walked off. Ryoka shook her head in disgust and then received a sharp kick to her shin. She glanced up.\n“You didn’t have to be so\nrude.\n”\nGaria hissed at Ryoka, her normally amicable face clouded over by a frown. She looked at Fals as the Runner left the inn, disappointed. Then she turned back to Ryoka.\n“He was trying to say sorry, Ryoka. Why’d you chase him off?”\n“I’m not going to ruin my dinner listening to forced apologies and have him try to find out what I’m delivering. You know that’s what he was here to do.”\nGaria hesitated.\n“Not—necessarily. He, uh—why don’t you like him?”\nRyoka blinked at the sudden change in topic.\n“He’s annoying. I hate charmers, and he’s not even that charming to begin with. Whose side is he on, anyways?”\n“No one’s. He’s trying to keep the Guild together, Ryoka.”\n“By stepping on anyone who gets out of line? Good method. He didn’t stop Persua and her cronies from attacking me—and he’s not going to do it again by the sounds of it.”\n“He would if you let him stick around. Fals can’t do anything to Persua except talk to her, but he’s trying to help. He was celebrating when he heard they got demoted to Street Runners! And he told Claudeil when no one was sure if you were going to walk again—he told him that if you didn’t walk, he should leave the region that night.”\nRyoka Griffin blinked at Garia. She hadn’t known that. Was Fals going to…pull a Persua on Claudeil? But almost instantly she had a thought, and faster than she could think twice, Ryoka sneered.\n“Oh, how\nchivalrous.\nToo bad he couldn’t say that to Persua. And I’m not sleeping with him either way.”\nShe snorted—and Garia pushed her. It was a shove—which sent Ryoka sprawling out of her chair and rolling across the floor.\n“Ryoka!”\nGaria was surprised—Ryoka rolled into a table and sprang up as the background noise stopped.\nHoly heck, I was just pushed by a gorilla.\nThat wasn’t an insult—that was how it felt. Terrifyingly strong. Garia was beet-red as everyone stared at her. Ryoka slowly sat down.\n“D-don’t be nasty. Fals likes you. He’s just not—don’t be\nnasty.\nYou’re the one who keeps provoking Persua, you know. I know she’s bad, but he’s on your side.”\nRyoka raised her eyebrows. She sat without a word. She hadn’t expected\nthat\n. Nor did she quite believe it. The two Runner girls sat in silence as Garia grew less red, and Ryoka took her time replying. She tried to be more diplomatic this time—and the end result was moderately better.\n“Good for him, but I don’t need help.”\n“Not even with Persua?”\nGaria saw Ryoka’s hand tighten on her fork, almost crushing the cheap pot metal.\n“Not even with her. I’ll deal with Persua now that I know what she’s like.”\nGaria was doubtful.\n“She’s like a dog, Ryoka. Even if you hurt her, she’ll keep coming back. And if you\ndo\nget her mad, she gets vicious.”\n“Oh, she’s like a dog. A female one. And you know what? I’m tired of her shit. If she tries anything again, I’ll put her down.”\nRyoka was about to go on, but Garia started frantically signaling her to stop. Ryoka didn’t stop, though. She’d already seen the multiple reflections in her mug, but some things needed saying.\n“She’s annoying, stupid, craven, and she doesn’t know how to run. I still owe her a broken leg. If she thinks she can try something else—”\n“\nHi Persua!\n”\nRyoka looked up. Persua stood in front of the table, smiling in a not-so-friendly way down at the two Runners. She had her usual group of cronies at her back, and Ryoka spotted a bigger guy behind them. Toriska and Claudeil were flanking someone six-foot-four—with a neck like a tree stump. But Persua was the one Ryoka focused on.\nFals hadn’t lied. The little, false, ‘friendly’ look Persua always gave had calcified. Now, it flaked away, revealing a sharp dagger of hatred that jabbed at Ryoka. She wasn’t just pissed…but it came out of her voice in the most syrupy-sweet tones Ryoka had heard. It made the hairs on her arms stand up.\nUh oh.\n“Ryoka, Garia! I’m so glad you’re okay! I almost didn’t spot you, but then I saw Garia—she’s impossible to miss even in this crowd—and I decided to say hi!”\nGaria turned bright red and looked down at her stack of plates while Ryoka looked up and met Persua’s eyes. A spark of hatred wouldn’t be enough to describe the look that flashed between the two.\nMean girls. Ryoka remembered them from school. Persua was a perfect representation of the school social climber who would tear down anyone she didn’t like.",

    "text": "And like the other girls Ryoka had clashed with, Persua didn’t need an invitation to keep talking. Her eyes flicked to Garia and then back to Ryoka.\n“So sorry to interrupt your conversation. Were you talking about me by any chance?”\nGaria flinched, but Ryoka’s expression didn’t change. She nodded and raised her mug to Persua and smiled a tiny bit.\n“Yeah, sorry, I just called you a bitch.”\nPersua’s smile vanished in a heartbeat. Claudeil made a sound that might have been a guffaw—but then he went quiet. Garia’s mouth opened in an ‘o’ of horror as she stared at Ryoka. Toriska looked at Persua, and even she looked worried.\n“That’s not very nice. I’d hate to think you were talking behind my back, Ryoka.”\n“Don’t worry. I’ll do it to your face. I’m busy, Persua. Go somewhere else.”\n“What if I want to stay? I’ve a right to sit in this inn, same as you.”\n“Find another table. But if I were you, I’d get out.”\n“Is that a threat?”\n“Yeah, pretty much.”\nPersua hesitated. She probably hadn’t expected Ryoka to confront her this quickly, but Ryoka knew how the conversation would have gone regardless. She nodded at Persua and her group.\n“You lot gonna piss off or do I have to make you leave?”\nIf Garia could have edged any further back from her table she’d be sitting at the one behind her. For a second, Persua and her friends hesitated. They might be Runners and outnumber the two by a good margin, but Ryoka had a certain\nedge\nabout her. But then someone shoved his way through the group and stood next to Persua.\nRyoka looked up past Persua and into a solid face. Solid, or ugly, if you wanted to be unkind. Toriska had her knife—but Ryoka had just been facing down Gargoyles and goats with knives for\nteeth.\nToriska was the one who took a step back, and even Claudeil hesitated.\n“Persua, the Guild’ll—”\n“Hey, Claudeil? Shut up.”\nShe turned her head, and her friend went quiet. The rest of the Runners were edging back, not wanting to be seen and get in trouble, and if it was just Persua, Claudeil, and Toriska, Ryoka would try them all on—she could grab a plate, and they could eat shards of pottery.\nBut Persua had brought backup this time. An adventurer scowled down at Ryoka and leaned forwards over the table.\n“I’d watch your mouth if I were you, Runner. You should show more respect to your seniors and betters.”\nOf course. Ryoka stared into murky green eyes and cursed herself for not remembering. Another trick mean girls liked to use when they couldn’t solve things with words. Run to the biggest boy in the room.\n“I don’t know who you are, but you’re in my face. Go away, and take Persua and her crew with you.”\nThe adventurer blinked. He was doing the classic male trick of crowding Ryoka, and it wasn’t working. She wasn’t even leaning back, and they were nearly nose to nose.\n“This is Arnel. He’s a Bronze-ranked adventurer in Celum.”\nPersua smiled from behind the adventurer. She patted Arnel on the shoulder, and he straightened and smiled back at her. She made a face when he turned back to glare at Ryoka. It was almost sad to see how obvious her contempt for him was and how much Arnel was being played. Almost. Ryoka had little sympathy for any guy playing the bully part.\nArnel leaned forwards again, this time towards Garia, who shrank back. He glared at Ryoka, who stared back at him until he blinked.\n“I think you should be a little more respectful to Miss Persua. An apology would be a good start, and I’d insist on it.”\n“Or what?”\nGaria kicked Ryoka again, hard.\n“Or what?”\nArnel looked back at Persua, who laughed shrilly. He smiled hostilely at Ryoka.\n“I guess then I’d have to teach you a lesson in manners, Runner.”\n“Really? That would be amusing to watch.”\nThe adventurer’s face went blank for a moment. Again, this wasn’t going according to how his brain had plotted the conversation out. But Persua stepped in to help him. She glared down at Ryoka.\n“Arnel’s an\nadventurer.\nHe’s fought monsters and slain countless Goblins. You don’t have that oaf of a Minotaur and that freak half-Elf to protect you now, Ryoka.”\n“Who says I need backup?”\nThis was too much for the impressionable Arnel. He was aware some of the other inn goers were snickering at him, and even the fat innkeeper was working up the nerve to order him to take the fight outside. He snarled and pushed Ryoka roughly in her seat.\n“Look, you idiot. I’m giving you only one warning—”\nRyoka stood up. She was shorter than Arnel, but far taller than he expected at 6’1’’, and when she pushed back her chair, the inn went silent. She still had her mug in her hands. Arnel was trying to come up with a good threat, but Persua backed away as Ryoka raised her mug to her lips.\nShe took a sip of her drink—mainly just for show—and then tossed the rest of her mug’s contents into the adventurer’s face. He blinked as watery ale ran down his nose and chin. Garia’s expression was a waxwork. Persua smiled evilly. Toriska and Claudeil hesitated and looked at Persua’s face and then at each other.\nTheir Guild memberships!\nBut if Ryoka started the fight—\nThe adventurer was still shifting from shock to outrage when Ryoka decked him with a spinning backhand. He crashed to the ground, and she tossed the mug at Persua. Not hard—well, okay, hard enough that the other girl had to duck before the container broke her nose, but not as hard as Ryoka could have tossed it. The cheap pottery shattered to bits, and Ryoka waited for Arnel to stand back up.\n“You craven\nwhore!\n”\nHe shouted as he rushed at her. Ryoka waited patiently as he came at her. She’d already moved far enough away from the table and cleared the chair from behind her.\nThe adventurer rushed at her, over a hundred—maybe two hundred pounds of angry guy. Ryoka shifted her weight and timed her strike. When the adventurer was only a few feet away, she moved.\nRyoka balanced on one leg while her other extended. She didn’t quite kick—it was more like a push. A powerful push that broke the adventurer’s charge and sent him stumbling back.\nHe came back, of course. They always did. But by that point, Ryoka had the room, leverage, and timing to set up her roundhouse. It came up and across his ribs, making a dull\nthudding\nsound as it struck him.\nThe adventurer gasped, lost the air in his lungs, and stumbled back. But he didn’t fall down.\nRyoka tried not to wince. She’d hit him hard, but he was wearing something hard underneath his clothing. Chain mail? It felt like she’d kicked that.\nQuickly, before he could move, she snap-kicked him in the chest. It wasn’t a Muay Thai move—but she didn’t have enough room for anything else.\nThis time, Arnel fell down, but he got up at once. Ryoka grimaced and hopped back as he swung at her. She threw a punch, but he caught it and lashed out at her face.\nRyoka caught his fist on an arm and felt the heavy blow. Damn. This wasn’t good. Now Arnel was really mad, and he was swinging wildly at her. She dodged and weaved backwards, but she had little room to maneuver. Plus, Ryoka was on the wrong foot mentally.\nShe wasn’t\nused\nto people getting up after she hit them.\nDodge, dodge—Ryoka threw a counter and hit him squarely on the jaw. But he was tough, and when he struck back, he finally landed a blow.\nRyoka felt the impact on her head and twisted her neck, but it still hurt. She backed up, and the adventurer came at her. She tried to keep him back with punches, but he was more than willing to trade hits.\nHe kept rushing her, and the tables and chairs made it nearly impossible for Ryoka to weave and dodge like she’d been taught. She instead raised her hands up around her head, forming a guard on both sides of her head. It was a traditional Muay Thai guard, but the problem was the adventurer wasn’t trying to hit or kick her that much.\nHe was a guy, and she had the definite sense he didn’t want to hit her so much as take her down. He kept trying to go for the bear hug. She let him get close but grabbed his shoulders and swept his feet out as he lunged.\nAgain, he went down. Ryoka wanted to stomp on his face or kick him in the nuts or both—but something flew at her head. She struck the mug down with one hand and glanced up. Persua glared and threw another glass, which missed Ryoka by miles.\nRyoka’s moment of inattention cost her. Arnel surged upwards, and she was too slow to get away. He seized her left arm and began punching at Ryoka. She hammered at his face, but he wouldn’t let go.\nHe was\nstrong\n. She couldn’t break free just by pulling, not that she had any intention to. Arnel hit Ryoka twice in the side of the face—not hard because he couldn’t get a good angle. She’d bloodied his nose and got him twice on the face, but he now pulled back for a big punch.\nThere was no way to get away. Ryoka got ready. She’d take the punch and then hit him with a knee. Hopefully she wouldn’t kill him or break anything too vital, but enough was enough.\nShe braced herself for a hit to her ribs. Arnel swung—\nAnd Garia grabbed his hand.\nAll of the man’s momentum carried him forwards, but Garia was a tree that he crashed into. He fought to get her to let go, but Garia had hold of his hand with her own, and her grip was like steel.\nIt was a three way tug-of-war with Arnel holding Ryoka and Garia holding him. Not for long, though. The instant his attention shifted to Garia, Ryoka acted. She clocked the man with a downwards elbow so fast he’d let go and she was away before he could blink.\n“Calm down! Everyone calm down!”\nAt last, Ryoka could hear what Garia was saying over the roaring of blood in her ears. Arnel was still cursing at her, tugging at Garia’s arm, and Persua was shouting for her friends to help him. But the other Runners didn’t want to get close, especially once they saw how Garia was effortlessly holding the bigger man back.\n“Let go, damn you!”\n“Come on, we can work this out—”\nRyoka tried to move to block, but Arnel’s fist caught Garia on the mouth even as she was talking. The bigger girl stumbled, and he wrenched his hand free. Triumphantly, Arnel turned on Ryoka and raised his fists.\nGaria stumbled, put her hand to her face, and looked up at the other man as Ryoka danced back. Her eyes burned, and she straightened. Garia made a clumsy fist and then moved forwards.\nRyoka was playing tag with her fist, and Arnel’s face was it. He still wasn’t going down or even slowing, but then a planet interposed itself between her and the adventurer: Garia. Arnel raised his hands for a hammer blow, but too late. Slow as she was, the other Runner was in the way. And then it happened.\nGaria threw a punch.\nIt was slow. Ryoka saw the other girl telegraph the motion, and she had terrible form. But when she\nhit\nthe adventurer, he made a sound. Or rather, his body made a sound.\nWumph.\nRyoka had never seen someone’s feet leave the floor from a punch. Arnel levitated for a second and then touched the ground as Garia’s fist let him down back to earth. He folded up like a sack of potatoes.\nHe was out. Completely out, without even a chance to object. Ryoka blinked down at the adventurer and saw the chain mail had deformed around Garia’s punch. The other girl rubbed at her hand and then turned.\nClaudeil had a chair raised. It was mid-swing when Garia caught it. She lifted it out of his hands, and he tried to hang on—until he felt that\nstrength.\nThen he let go. Toriska had her dagger drawn, but she hadn’t jumped into the fight—mostly waved it around. She looked at Garia, at the Bronze-rank adventurer, and backed up. Ryoka was one thing, and Claudeil and Toriska hated her enough, but—\nGaria?\nThe rest of the Street Runners were already running. Persua had slipped out the door before the fight had even ended. Her friends made to follow suit, but Ryoka caught Claudeil and threw him into a table. He scrambled up, yelping, as she gave him a damn good kick to his back. Ryoka managed to punch Toriska hard enough to bruise her cheek, and then they were gone.",

    "text": "The aftermath of a tavern brawl was never fun, especially when you had an innkeeper screaming at you. But Arnel had money—barely enough to cover the costs—and Ryoka wasn’t about to pay for something she hadn’t started. Well, she had started it, but she still wasn’t going to pay.\nThe upshot of it was that Garia and Ryoka were kicked out of the inn, at least for the rest of dinner. They walked down the street, Garia talking excitedly to Ryoka.\n“You were\namazing!\nHe barely touched you the entire time!”\n“Eh. I should have knocked him out in the first few moments. He was tougher than I thought. Got me a few times.”\nGingerly, Ryoka touched at her cheek and arms. Bruises. Not too deep, but annoying. She deserved them, though, for being so sloppy.\n“But the way you\nmoved\n! He was an adventurer, and you treated him like some kind of Level 1 [Thug]! How’d you do it?”\n“Oh, it’s just martial arts. A bit of Muay Thai and other styles.”\nRyoka glanced at Garia’s blank face and elaborated.\n“It’s a way to fight unarmed. You learn how to kick, punch, throw, etcetera properly.”\n“Really? This Muy—muy tai thing is good? Is it a Skill?”\nRyoka wanted to groan or roll her eyes.\n“Not a Skill. It’s something you learn, not a class or anything. I learned it when I was a kid. You could learn it too.”\n“Really? Well, I mean, I’d love to know how to move like that. You were amazing back there! You’re practically as good as an adventurer yourself!”\nRyoka laughed shortly.\n“He wasn’t that great. And martial arts don’t work on monsters. Believe me, I figured that out the hard way.”\n“Still, I couldn’t believe it. When you threw the mug in his face I thought we’d have to run for sure. But you took him down!”\nRyoka stopped. She eyed Garia and shook her head with a frown.\n“No.\nYou\ntook him down. With one punch.”\n“Yeah, but…”\nGaria blushed and shook her head.\n“I was just angry. You hit him way more than I did.”\nThis time, it was Ryoka’s turn to object.\n“Don’t sell yourself short. That last punch was serious business. I hit that guy several times and he didn’t fall down, but you went right through his chainmail shirt. You’re far stronger than both me and that adventurer. That last punch you threw was harder than my\nkick\n.”\n“Well, you know…I carry a lot of heavy things…”\nRyoka realized Garia was turning red, and not because she was happy. The barefoot girl stopped in the nearly empty street and eyed Garia.\n“What’s wrong? It was a great punch. Your form was terrible, but being strong’s not a problem.”\n“It’s just—it’s just a bit embarrassing, that’s all. You know?”\n“No. Explain it to me.”\nGaria clearly didn’t want to, but Ryoka wouldn’t let her off the hook. She sighed.\n“I’m a [Runner]. And—I know I’m bigger than most girls. I just don’t like talking about my size.”\n“You’re fine.”\n“I’m glad you think so, but—it’s because of my class. And the way I eat, but my class is part of it. That’s why I’m so strong too, but it’s embarrassing.”\n“Why?”\nThere was no getting out of it. Garia looked around, but there was no one around to hear her. Even so, she lowered her voice.\n“Um, I was a [Farm Worker] before I became a [Runner]. I got to Level 14 before I changed classes. That’s why I’m so…so…”\nShe blushed deeply red. Ryoka looked blankly at Garia.\n“So strong? What’s the problem?”\n“I’m\nbig\n, Ryoka! I don’t want to be, but [Farm Workers] bulk up, and it’s impossible to lose weight! My dad says it’s fine and that I take after him, but I’d rather my mother. I don’t want to be big. I want to be small and light like you and—”\nGaria looked like she was about to cry. Her face was red, and she was starting to stammer. After a moment, Ryoka patted her on the shoulder.\n“I’m not light. Well, I am in shape, but so are you. What’s wrong with being that strong? Anyways, a [Farm Worker] doesn’t sound like that bad a job—class. Why do you care?”\nGaria shook her head despairingly. She didn’t know how to explain it.\n“It’s not a great class. Or a job, really. Even [Farmers] get more respect since they actually know how to till the land and take care of it properly. I just helped out with the plowing, lifting, and so on. But when I used to tell people what class I had, they’d laugh—or they’d figure it out because of how I looked.”\nRyoka didn’t get it. She really didn’t, but it sounded like there was some elitism amongst classes. Class warfare in the literal sense? But she understood the general problem.\n“People are bastards no matter what world you’re in. Look, forget about it. That class helped you out if you’re that strong without needing any training, right?”\nGaria nodded and sniffed.\n“It was helpful. Even if no one likes the class, we get some useful Skills. [Lesser Strength] is the first Skill most warriors get, but [Farm Workers] get it too. Um, I got that on my second level up. But then there’s [Enhanced Strength], which is what I have, and I’ve heard if you reach really high levels, some people get [Greater Strength].”\n“And that’s rare?”\n“I’ve never seen anyone with it. But yeah, [Enhanced Strength] only comes to warrior classes around Level 30. The fact that I got it so early on means I’m a lot stronger than normal. Dad used to make me help him pull out tree stumps instead of using a horse.”\n“W-whoa.”\nYou had to know something about farming—or roots—to understand what that meant. She and her father had…?\nThat was impressive.\nRyoka had always guessed Garia was strong, but this afternoon had confirmed it for her. She paused and thought before asking another question.\n“If this Skill is so good, why doesn’t everyone become a [Farm Worker] for a while before becoming an adventurer? That seems like the smartest move.”\nGaria looked surprised.\n“Why would they do that? No one wants to work on a farm. It’s boring and tiring, Ryoka.”\n“But for the Skill—”\n“You don’t know you’ll get it right away. I just got lucky. Okay, a lot of workers like me get at least [Lesser Strength] quickly, but it depends. Anyways, I worked on my father’s farm until I was eighteen, and I only hit Level 14 even though I worked every day from dawn till dusk. It’s not worth it.”\n“Ah.”\nIt sounded—well, it sounded like there was some inefficiency in the way people thought about Skills. Ryoka didn’t play many video games, but if she could get this [Enhanced Strength] from working on a farm as a kid, she’d do that. But then again—18 years was a long time, it was true.\nIt was a moot point anyways since Ryoka didn’t intend to level, even if she was jealous of Garia’s strength. But the other girl was clearly embarrassed by her body and her class, so Ryoka let the topic drop.\n“At least Persua got taught a lesson, although I missed my chance to break her arm. I’ll have to do it next time I see her.”\nGaria winced. She knew Ryoka wasn’t kidding.\n“Please don’t. If you do, she’ll try something worse.”\n“Worse than getting an adventurer to beat the crap out of me? I think I’ll take my chances.”\nRyoka shook her head. She’d have to do something about that girl. Killing her was tempting, but she probably couldn’t get away with it.\n“Never mind. I appreciate the help. But I’ve got bigger fish to fry.”\n“You’re hungry? I know a good place to eat if you want—”\n“I mean, I’ve got stuff to do. Look, you said Ceria’s in Esthelm, right? Where’s that?”\nGaria scratched her head as she tried to remember.\n“Near the road that goes to Liscor. It’s down south, about sixty miles away?”\nRyoka nodded. She could do that in a single night. She eyed the rooftops surreptitiously and looked around. Casually, she raised her voice as she talked to Garia.\n“I’ll sleep here for the night. Then I might go and head on down. If you want to learn how to fight properly, visit me there.”\n“Maybe. I’m not sure what I’ll be doing—or if I want to fight. I don’t like violence.”\nRyoka clapped Garia on the shoulder.\n“It’s your choice. But with a punch like that, it would be a shame not to learn how to hit the right way. I’ll teach you next time we meet, how about that?”\nIt was the first time Garia had ever seen Ryoka being pushy about—anything, really. She agreed she might give it a shot and watched as the barefoot girl jogged back to her inn for the night.\n“Martial arts?”\nGaria stared down at her hand. It was still callused from her days of long work out in the sun. She made a fist experimentally. It felt clumsy, but Ryoka had been impressed. That was rare enough.\n“But all the way to Esthelm. That’s a far…”\nBut she didn’t have anything else she was committed to doing, and there was always work for someone willing to haul heavy goods long distance. More to the point, it might be better for Garia to skip town as well.\nThe Runner girl thought about what Persua’s reaction to the day’s events would be. Not to mention the local Adventurer’s Guild. They would\nnot\nbe happy to learn one of their own had been beaten by a civilian, let alone a Runner. Garia shuddered and thought that maybe she would take a few long distance requests this week. Probably towards Esthelm, but at the very least away from Celum.\nShe began to slowly jog off back to her own inn. From a rooftop, the [Assassin] watched Garia go. She wasn’t important, but any friend of Ryoka needed to be reported to Magnolia. It was just as well the girl had ended the fight before he’d needed to step in.\nSilently, the nondescript man followed Ryoka stealthily back to her inn. It would ordinarily have been a chore protecting the girl from the inevitable reprisal from both Runner and Adventurer’s Guild, but tonight was an exception. All he had to do was wait. Someone else had an appointment with Ryoka Griffin, whether the girl liked it or not.",

She napped lightly, waking up when her iPhone quietly set off its alarm.\nHaving an iPhone was incredibly convenient. She just wished she could cast the [Repair] spell rather than needing a mage to do it. Just another reason to visit Ceria.\nIt was fully night as Ryoka got dressed. She moved around her room quietly, gathering items while her ears strained for the faintest noise.\nNothing. Well, she hadn’t expected to hear anything. She just hoped her closed curtains were enough to conceal her movements.\nRyoka’s eyes flicked to the window. In Celum—in every city in this world really, the night truly\nwas\ndark. There were no neon lights or passing cars to provide illumination. And while some lamps and torches provided light on the street, the rooftops and many streets had only the faint moonlight to light the way.\nPerfect.\nRyoka didn’t have much. Just some clothes, some money, her iPhone, and books. And she’d sold the books she’d already read, so all of her possessions fit neatly into her Runner’s pack. She left a few coins on the table and opened the window silently.",

    "text": "The [Assassin] who was reluctantly known as Theofore stood on the inn’s rooftop and tried to keep his senses alert. It was hard, though. He was dressed in nondescript dark clothing, but it wasn’t quite enough to keep the night’s breeze from chilling him. Winter would soon be upon the land, and when that happened, stakeouts such as these would become direly painful without heating crystals or expensive magics.\nBut this was the job, and he was a professional. Not a high-level one, but he was still competent enough to be assigned to Lady Magnolia on request. That was also because the Guild really didn’t want to waste a higher-level member on a trivial assignment, but this Ryoka Griffin had proven to be quite a challenge to keep track of. The High Passes incident had been disastrous. But at least she was asleep—\nA movement below made Theofore jerk up. He heard a window slide open, and then a lithe figure swung herself up onto the roof. There was nowhere to run, and so Ryoka saw Theofore crouched silently in place over her room.\nFor a moment, both figures stared at each other across the short distance. Then Ryoka got to her feet.\nTheofore leapt up, hands going to his knives, but of course he couldn’t attack. He had to keep her in the inn, though, which meant hand-to-hand combat. Again, he was trained in this area as well, but Ryoka Griffin was far stronger than the average Bronze-rank adventurer.\nRyoka stepped forwards on the roof, and Theofore leaned back just in time to avoid the quick jab she aimed at his face. He struck out at her with his one unarmed combat Skill—[Nerve Strike: Paralysis]—but she swatted his hand down.\nDamnation. This was bad. The inn’s roof was on a slant that made dodging and fighting twice as hard, even for an [Assassin]. If Theofore had the [Sure Footing] Skill, things might have been different, but—\nRyoka lashed out with an overhead chop. It was completely easy to block, but that was the point. As the [Assassin]’s arm went up, Ryoka stepped forward and kicked.\nHe’d seen her fight, but he still wasn’t prepared for the low kick that smashed into his right leg, just above his knee. Theofore staggered. It felt as if an axe had struck his leg, numbing it with pain. He danced backwards, trying not to show any trace of agony on his face.\nBut Ryoka didn’t advance; instead, she hefted her backpack and turned. Theofore cursed and dashed forwards, but she was already running. Ryoka’s bare feet kicked off as she ran along the slanted rooftop. She reached the edge and\nleapt.\nIn the darkness of the night, a lone figure hurtled over the rooftop and landed with a heavy\nthump\non another rooftop. She ran, vaulted over a chimney with both hands, and started leaping across buildings in a style known in her world as Parkour.\nTo Theofore, it looked hauntingly similar to the movements of higher level [Assassins]. He gave chase, cursing as his injured leg slowed him down. Ryoka was already gaining speed. He could not lose her.\nShe knew he was following her. Her head turned back for a moment as she saw him dashing across the roofs after her. Theofore couldn’t see in the darkness, but he thought she smiled for a moment.\nRyoka turned her head forwards and increased her speed. One hand came up, and a finger rose in an unmistakable gesture.\nTheofore growled and ran faster, ignoring his damaged limb. He wouldn’t lose her. He was a professional, and he’d been trained to outrun even [Runners] if necessary.\nThe two raced from rooftop to rooftop, vaulting, rolling, and jumping, probably giving the inhabitants within a start as they pounded across the uneven terrain. Ryoka was ahead of Theofore by a few houses, but he would catch her soon enough. He was an [Assassin], and she was just a [Runner].\nHe would catch her. [Assassins] were known for their ability to follow their targets on high-speed chases. They were known for their mastery of climbing and swift movement on rooftops. They were known for—\nRyoka leapt onto another roof and slid down the roof tiles, knocking them out of place. She kicked off the rooftop, flipped over, and rolled as she struck the street cobblestones below. Theofore gaped as Ryoka rolled back onto her feet and kept running without even pausing. In seconds, she was out of sight.\nHe paused on the rooftop. Even if he’d known what she would do, he would have wasted valuable seconds finding a handhold and swinging down. He definitely would not have tried jumping all the way down like she did. Was it a Skill? Or—\nIt didn’t matter. She was on the ground, and Theofore knew he wouldn’t catch her now. He knew where she was going, which was a small mercy.\nBut Theofore knew Lady Magnolia would\nnot\nbe happy with his failure. Slowly, reluctantly, he began moving back to the inn where Ryoka had been staying. He would have to report. There would be repercussions, and they would fall on his head. He would most likely be reassigned or a senior member of the Guild would be sent. But that was only the Guild. More importantly, Lady Magnolia would not be happy.\nShe wouldn’t be happy at all.",

    "text": "Lady Magnolia was a happy woman almost all of the time. She was deliberately happy and good natured because people liked a happy person. It lowered their guards, and besides, she found happiness more preferable to suspicion or pessimism anyways.\nAnd in this case, Magnolia was happy because she was finally able to reach a confrontation. True, it wasn’t on her terms, but you couldn’t win every battle. Ryoka had managed to avoid coming to her for quite some time, so Magnolia would go to her.\nIt was a poor bargaining position to be the seeking party rather than the one holding all the cards, but sometimes it was necessary to be proactive. And in this case, Magnolia had decided to up the ante.\nHappiness was good, as was being kind and generous. Generosity opened many doors that threats would not. Generosity and implicit but unstated threats opened even more doors in Magnolia’s experience.\nCase in point. Magnolia was visiting an inn, a lowly establishment not suited to a woman of her rank and station. Personally, she would have enjoyed visiting an inn if it weren’t unseemly, but in this case, her visit was purely business. And here generosity had done its work well. A kind suggestion or two and a few gold coins and the innkeeper had cleared out the inn for her.\nIt was late, and no doubt the occupants were unhappy to be roused and sent out. But some money and a meal courtesy of Lady Magnolia and most ills would be soothed. It was fine if they disliked her.\nThe Runners of Celum and the entire region had protested her requirements that they fulfill every delivery. They claimed they were exhausted. They stated, fairly, that she was pushing them past their limits and working them to the bone.\nAnd yet they were levelling.\nA fact that they conveniently seemed to forget. Magnolia remembered it. Kindness…kindness was a useful, moral thing in some situations. In others, it was inefficient. Useless for doing what had to be done.\nA [Butler] opened the carriage door as Magnolia let Ressa help her out. A light rain had begun to fall over the city, so a cloth parasol enchanted with the best [Water Resistance] spells was immediately placed over the [Lady]’s head.\nHer maids and a few other men and women she’d discreetly hired had spread out around the inn, and ‘discouraged’ several Runners and a few adventurers who’d been lurking around the back door.\nRessa accompanied Lady Magnolia to the second floor. The other [Assassins] and [Maids] remained below, awaiting Magnolia’s orders. She had no fear. Her Head Maid was enough of an escort even if Ryoka should prove belligerent, and of course a [Lady] had her own means of defense.\nBut Magnolia did not anticipate much trouble. Or rather, she expected she could handle whatever trouble emerged with her own Skills. She stopped in front of Ryoka’s door and knocked.\nNo response. Magnolia exchanged a glance with Ressa, and she tried again more loudly.\nAgain, there was no response. The [Lady] frowned. She would have expected Ryoka to notice the inn’s occupants being roused, but, ah, perhaps the girl was being stubborn. Very well.\nLady Magnolia raised her voice.\n“Good evening Miss Griffin.\nMay I come in?\n”\nThere was no response.\nStrange. Lady Magnolia knew\nthat\nshould have worked. She raised her voice.\n“Ryoka, my dear? Hello? Is anyone there?”\nDead silence. Lady Magnolia frowned.\n“…Hello?”\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

Scattered around the trio was a mess of empty dishes, remnants of a large breakfast.\nRyoka sat in a small room in the Adventurer’s Guild in Esthelm and waited as the half-Elven mage got ready in front of her.\nThey were separated by many miles in distance, but the two young women had both asked the same question. One had woken up and bribed her mage with food and invited a Goblin to learn. The other had run through the night and arrived tired and sweaty to knock on the [Mage]’s door and ask to be taught.\nThe mages were different as well. One was a partly Human woman who appeared only slightly older than Ryoka, but whose appearance hinted at something timeless, and whose beauty attracted the eye. But these were only hints, and her beauty was as much due to her heritage as her physical appearance. Yet for all that, she was a rare sight in any nation: a half-Elven mage named Ceria. She answered the door chewing on some dry jerky.\nThe other mage was Pisces. His gray and dirty robes were as always stained by grass, weather, and the dark places where he roamed. He still had spilled egg on one sleeve of his robes. He was graceful enough too, in his way. He walked well, but he hid any of his good qualities behind the hunched, filthy hermit crab he sometimes resembled.\nDifferent mages, different seekers, and different locations. But the questions asked and answered were mostly the same. Because the nature of the questions revolved around magic, and both mages had studied together, once.",

He sighed and then looked at Erin and the Goblin sitting next to her.\n“If we are to do this, must we include the Goblin?”\nErin’s glare transitioned into a scowl.\n“Her name is Rags.”\nPisces raised his eyebrows.\n“That is the name you gave her, certainly. Her Goblin name may be unpronounceable to you and I, but I suspect she objects to your pet name as much as I do.”\nRags stared at Pisces. He avoided her gaze—mostly because he’d lost the last three staring contests in a row. Erin glowered, folding her arms.\n“It’s better than calling her ‘Goblin’. Besides, she doesn’t mind it. Right, Rags?”\nErin glanced sideways quickly. Rags didn’t exactly avoid her gaze as she stared pointedly at Pisces.\n“Ahem. Names aside, why is she\nhere\n? You asked me to teach you magic.”\n“Right, and I thought she’d like to learn too.”\nRags nodded. Pisces sighed and rubbed at his face.\n“It is just—may I state my objections now? Magic is not a game or a ‘trick’. I took your request seriously in no small way because I believed you had a genuine desire to learn. Well, the Goblin might wish for the same, but this is no trivial matter. Will you promise to take this seriously?”\n“As serious as pie.”\nErin smiled as Pisces glared at her. Then she yelped as Rags jabbed Erin in the side with one cracked fingernail. The girl glared at the small Goblin. The Goblin glared back.\n“Fine, fine. I\nam\ntaking this seriously, Pisces. And I do want to know. So teach me? Please?”\nPisces hesitated.",

    "text": "“—Of course I could teach you, Ryoka. And I’d be happy to help—but I have to ask, what brought this on?”\nCeria bustled around the small room she’d rented in the Adventurer’s Guild, hunting for her wand among her strewn-about possessions. She was messy. She chewed on the strip of dried meat as she hunted, kicking over boots, finding a book under her bed covers—\n“How long have you been staying here?”\n“Uh, two days? Gerial’s room is disgusting, you know. He folds his sheets and lines his boots up. Polishes them too. Calruz is almost as bad. You want to stay? The Guild doesn’t like non-adventurers, but we can ask.”\nCeria finally found her wand under her bed. She glanced up at Ryoka.\n“You ran through the night to get here? And dodged an…[Assassin]? I really can’t believe that one, but you described a classic [Assassin] perfectly.”\nRyoka perched on the rickety chair and watched as Ceria’s light hazelnut hair caught the sunlight. For all she’d hung out with Ceria before, the half-Elf truly was different in the unearthly feeling she gave off. Ryoka tried not to stare too openly most of the time, but Ceria was too distracted lifting up her mattress and checking under her pillow for her spellbook now to notice Ryoka’s scrutiny.\nThe barefoot girl tried not to yawn as she thought of a response. At least she wasn’t still sweaty. The Adventurer’s Guild might not have showers, but they did have washbasins and a handy well.\n“It’s just something that really interests me. And defending myself is part of it, but I just want to learn about magic. It was not…widely practiced where I come from.”\nCeria’s brows rose, but she let that comment slide, much to Ryoka’s relief. She swished the wand around in the air with a satisfying sound and smiled at Ryoka.\n“Fair enough. Just please don’t be disappointed if you don’t start casting [Fireballs] left and right, okay? Most Humans I’ve tried to teach, well, they’re quite impatient. And it’s not as if having a half-Elf teacher makes learning magic any easier.”\n“Perish the thought.”\nCeria had offered Ryoka the only chair, and she had to sit on her bed. She placed her wand on the side table next to Ryoka, and the Runner dragged her chair over so they were facing each other.\n“Very well, how should I start? I suppose it would be important to learn how much you know of magic.”\nRyoka spread her hands out wordlessly. Ceria shook her head and smiled.\n“That simplifies things. Well then, I guess I’ll tell you what magic is.”",

But in Human cities and other nations, students study under older mages or travel to schools like Wistram Academy.”\nRyoka frowned.

    "text": "Pisces looked disgruntled at Erin’s question. He folded his arms and scowled.\n“I assume you mean half-Elves. Yes, their affinity towards spellcasting is far greater than our own.\nHowever\n, a speciesist advantage does not translate into individual ability. Nor does that mean the greatest mages are always nonhuman. In fact, some of the most famous Archmages of this era are Human. Like, er, Verdan Blackwood. Or Archmage Viltach. Great…esteemed [Mages] I have personally met.”\nHe coughed into the sleeve of his robes, as if this were not the brag he was trying to make it out to be.\n“—Any species can learn magic. But not all members have the potential. From Minotaurs to Dullahans to Centaurs, [Mages] exist. Except Gnolls, of course, but they have their [Shamans].”\n“Wait, not Gnolls? Why?”\nPisces gave Erin a blank stare.\n“One supposes it is their tribal magic. I have never met a Gnoll at Wistram or a [Mage] of their people in general. They have [Shamans]—another kind of magic-user. But no [Mages] in Wistram. I heard a rumor once—nevermind. Minotaurs can be [Mages]. Anyone can be a [Mage]. But Gnolls. Even Goblins. Is this clear enough for you?”\nErin tried to imagine Minotaurs but just came up with those ancient Greek pictures of bull-headed monsters with Human bodies. She had a hard time imagining one of those things muttering spells or reading a book.\nPisces scowled, and Erin stopped grinning.\n“Okay, sure. Not all Humans are mages. Some of us are Muggles. Got it?”\n“Muggles?”\n“Uh—how about Goblins?”\nPisces sniffed.\n“I have never heard of any Goblin whose abilities matched that of a proper mage. Their innate capabilities are likely too low to support the strain of spellcasting. Their race as a whole can barely snuff out a candle, let alone magically.”\nBoth Rags and Erin sat upright in indignation. Erin opened her mouth, but Rags stuck her finger up first.\nSince it wasn’t her middle finger but rather her index, both Pisces and Erin stared at it curiously. Rags muttered a few words in her own language and then glared at her fingertip.\nNothing happened. Erin exchanged a glance with Pisces, and then a spark of light made her blink. She looked at Rags’ finger and gasped. A tiny flame danced on her fingertip. Erin stared at it and then at Rags.\n“\nYou\ncan do magic?”\nPisces shook his head. He blew, and the flame on Rags’ finger went out. She narrowed her eyes, but he wasn’t impressed by her magic or her stare.\n“Tribal magic. Feh. Just as I said—Gnolls\nand\nGoblins have access to another, lesser…\ndifferent\nkind of magic.”\n“Wait a second.”\nErin was extremely confused.\n“Isn’t that magic? Why’d you call it tribal magic?”\nPisces rubbed at his temple.\n“I should really ban questions. Well, to summarize a complex issue, the magic your little friend used is not true magic. Or at least, not the magic practiced by [Mages]. It is an amalgamation of mana drawn from her tribe, such as it is.”\nErin stared blankly at Pisces.\n“What?”\nHe sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose.\n“Allow me to explain another way. Magic surrounds us. It is in everything, but an individual’s capacity for magic varies. And the same goes for our surroundings. Thus, in a highly magically charged environment, spells are naturally easy to cast. In a null zone, a [Mage] must rely solely on his or her own internal magical energy to cast spells.”\n“Right. I got that.”\nPisces nodded. He pointed at Rags, who leaned out of the way of his finger.\n“Goblins, on the other hand, practice a different form of magic. They draw their mana not only from the environment, but from each other. Thus a single Goblin may use the mana of the entire tribe it is affiliated with to cast spells.”\nErin snapped her fingers, and Rags jumped. The Goblin stared suspiciously at Erin’s hand and immediately tried to duplicate the gesture.\n“Oh, I get it. You’re crowd-sourcing magic.”\nPisces blinked at Erin and then decided to ignore her strange comments and Rags’ attempts to learn to snap her own fingers.\n“Yes, well, it is a crude thing. But I suppose it is powerful enough in its own way as it allows even Goblin tribes one or two spellcasters of their own. These, ah, ‘shamans’ draw power from the collective. The larger their group is, the more power they wield. Thus, while the Goblins in the area most likely cannot collectively create more than a few sparks, a larger tribe of a thousand souls would create a decently powerful [Shaman]. But it is inefficient.”\nPisces shook his head.\n“A thousand people and only one caster? A ridiculous waste.”\n“Hey, if it works…”\nHe sniffed.\n“It isn’t proper magic, that’s all. True, these [Shamans] may copy many magic spells, but they are born out of a collective will and lack structure and form. True, they can do things that modern magic cannot easily replicate. I have heard some [Shamans] can heal or move vast groups of people over water, but\nmagic—\n”\n“You can walk on water!? And heal? What am I talking to you about, then? Rags, teach me your ways!”\nErin swung around instantly. Pisces scowled at her as the Goblin smirked at him.\n“A neophyte in tribal magic and a tiny tribe can hardly do the greatest feats of magic, Erin.\nMiss Solstice.\nNor can one heal in any kind of magic easily.”\n“Oh yeah? What about [Healers]?”\nErin thought she made a good point—until she realized Pisces was smirking at her.\n“Ah, well. [Healers] are now simply general practitioners of restorative arts, some of whom are able to cast spells. Most use Skills. Many rely on potions or even simple bandages rather than magic. The definition of the class has changed, and accordingly, so have the skills and spells learnt. It was quite a fascinating phenomenon, actually. I studied it in a course back in Wistram—”\nPisces shook his head.\n“But I haven’t time to get into the variation in classes over centuries. Where was I? Oh, of course.\nMagic.\nLet us not forget what we are here to learn. Very well, I assume you understand a bit of what magic is. Now to test you.”\nPisces raised his hands and suddenly advanced on Rags and Erin. Their chairs scooted back, and he stopped, looking peeved.\n“It is not a dangerous process. I simply wish to ascertain whether or not either of you can become mages. I will test you in the traditional style. Do not move, and I will saturate the area around you with raw mana and allow you to demonstrate your magical ability—or lack thereof.”",

Ryoka blinked and rubbed at her eyes. Somehow, Ceria’s wand had begun tracing the image in three dimensions. And then the image shifted again, and the rune—or was it a word?—in the air took on more dimensions than could be captured by a camera.\nRyoka thought she\nheard\nthe magical word being drawn in the air.

    "text": "Pisces hissed, and his face scrunched up with concentration. He was already reddening, but neither Goblin nor Human was doing anything.\nErin focused. She really did. She tried thinking of a flame like the one Rags had conjured, but she just ended up thinking of lighters and matches. She tried muttering words.\n“Expelliarmus. Alohamora. Wingardium Leviosa. Wingardium levio\nsa\n.”\n“What are you muttering?”\n“Nothing.”\nIt wasn’t working. Erin couldn’t feel anything except a mild ache in her arms from holding them up for so long. She gritted her teeth. She could do this. She closed her eyes and\npushed—\nA flame burst upwards and evaporated into a cloud of smoke. Erin gasped and grinned in relief and triumph—\nRags blinked at her finger and then pointed again. Pisces yelped as a flare of fire burst from her fingertip and twisted towards him. It evaporated into smoke before it reached his robes and set him off into a coughing fit. Erin blinked.\n“Oh. More tribal magic?”\nThe [Mage] shook his head and coughed, waving away the smoke. He didn’t seem angry. Instead, he stared at Rags for a few seconds before replying very slowly.\n“That was no tribal magic. That was the very beginning of the [Firefly] spell.”\n“Really?”\nEncouraged, Erin stretched her fingers out and tried as hard as she could to do the same thing. But Pisces wasn’t staring at her. His attention was fixed on the proud Goblin. He put one hand on his chin and started muttering to himself.\n“Goblins\ncannot\nlearn magic in the traditional sense. It is impossible. Surely if they had the potential it would have been discovered, analyzed in centuries hence. The potential ramifications—or is it simple freak divergence? Ancestry?”\nHe whirled and pointed at Rags, who leaned back.\n“You. Goblin child. Was your mother non-Goblin? Or…your father?”\nShe shook her head.\n“What would that matter?”\nErin snapped at Pisces. He jumped, and she glared at his hands. He put them back over hers and talked while he focused again.\n“It would explain things. The offspring of Goblins are always Goblins regardless of the partner, male or female. But sometimes Goblins may inherit traits from their…parents. The, ah, victim might play a part in explaining unusual talents. But if this young Goblin—Rags has no immediate non-Goblin ancestors, it would mean—”\n“She can be a mage. I get it.”\nErin scowled at her hands. She\nwilled\nthem to catch fire.\n“Don’t stop. It’s my turn now. The test isn’t over yet, right? I can still continue?”\nPisces hesitated. Something in his face softened as he looked at Erin.\n“…By all means. Keep on trying.”\nShe ignored the look in his eyes and the way Rags looked at him. Erin stared at her hands. She would cast magic. She could. She\nwould\ncast magic. She\nwould—",

    "text": "Ryoka tried not to scream as she stared at the word and the magic stared back. It was inescapable, even when she closed her eyes. The word was the beginning, and the word was magic, and magic was with her, and the magic was made into reality—\nIt seared Ryoka’s mind like wildfire. The knowledge burned through her assumptions and all she’d been taught all her life, breaking down walls in her head she’d never known were there. The agony of it was unbearable.\nCeria was shaking her, trying to get Ryoka to move. She was telling Ryoka this\nshouldn’t\nbe happening, trying to erase the magic word. But it was ingrained in Ryoka’s soul. It was a bit of truth, and it was something to cling to even as the rest of the world fell to pieces.\nRyoka opened her eyes. The magic surged through her, a feeling unlike any other. It wasn’t being more alive. Life was life, but magic—it was opening another door and stepping into a different world.\nSuddenly, the pain was gone. Ryoka sat up and brushed Ceria’s hands off her.\n“I’m okay. I am. I saw it.”\nCeria peered anxiously into Ryoka’s face. The running girl had bitten her lips so hard she’d drawn blood, but she didn’t seem to notice.\n“I saw it.”\nRyoka repeated and stared at the fading shape in the air. She didn’t need to see it, though. She could remember. She would\nalways\nremember.\nThe knowledge was in her eyes, in the way Ryoka moved, in everything she was. Ceria looked at Ryoka, and whatever she saw reassured her. She smiled, relieved.\n“Well? Did you see what I wrote? Can you tell me what it says?”\nRyoka took a deep breath. It had no real name. None that the English language was capable of expressing, even with a thousand words. But there was still a way to say it.\nShe opened her mouth.\n“[Light].”\nIn the stillness of the early morning, light shimmered through the window. All was still, and then the light of the sun was joined by something else.\nA soft light came up through Ryoka’s chest. It came down her arms and up through her palms, which began to glow. A bauble of shimmering colors drifted up from between Ryoka’s palms, hovering in front of her face as she stared.\nIt was the most magical thing Ryoka had ever seen. It was hers. A glowing, sharply defined orb of what she could only call light made manifest. It was brighter than a light bulb because it was pure light, and yet it was not blinding either. If she stared hard enough, she could see straight through the other side.\nAnd it wasn’t white light either. Even as Ryoka stared at it, delicate shades of purple coalesced and then slowly transitioned into a deep blue and then brightened to green and then yellow. The light was living, and it shifted even as she held it.\nIt…it looked sort of like a three dimensional loading wheel on a Mac computer if Ryoka was honest. Even as she thought that, the colors changed and began to rotate in an annoyingly-familiar way.\nCeria blinked down at Ryoka’s light ball in surprise. She placed one hand on her hip and poked at the orb with the other. Her finger passed straight through the orb, making the light shimmer around her pale skin.\n“I’ve\nnever\nseen colors like that before. They’re so…bright.”\nShe picked up her wand and tapped it on her palm. Instantly—far quicker than Ryoka’s own spell had taken—another shimmering orb of light rose from Ceria’s palm. But her light was different. When she held the orb next to Ryoka’s, the colors changed and deepened in ways Ryoka’s did not.\nThey were the same colors as the ones flashing through Ryoka’s orb of light, but somehow they were more\nreal\n. The blue that illuminated the small room wasn’t more vivid or in any way brighter, but it felt deeper, subtler, to Ryoka’s eyes. It was a more complete understanding of what ‘blue’ was, and it made her digital colors pale by comparison.\n“Wow.”\nAs Ryoka stared, the lights in her orb began to shift, matching those of Ceria’s. She stared at the orb and then concentrated.\nThe ball of light shifted from white light suddenly and then shifted to a dark ultraviolet that made Ceria jump in surprise. Black light. Ryoka blinked. Suddenly, the orb was a rainbow spectrum of colors, a dancing discoball of shifting colors—\nAll at once, the magic ran out. The light vanished, and Ryoka sat back in her chair. She felt light-headed all of a sudden, as if the blood had suddenly rushed to her head. Weakly, she tried to sit back up, but Ceria pushed her down gently.\n“Hold on, hold on, Ryoka! That was incredible! I don’t think I’ve ever seen someone do that with a basic [Light] spell before—let alone figure out how to change a spell so quickly! You just used up all the mana in your body. You’ll be tired until you recover. Here—sit there, and I’ll get you something to eat and drink. That helps.”\nCeria dashed out of the room. Ryoka stared at her hands.\nShe smiled.",

    "text": "The last bead of sweat dropped from Pisces’ chin. He gasped and raised his hands.\n“I’m almost drained. I’m sorry. I can’t keep going.”\nErin still stared at her fingertips. If she could just\nforce\nsomething to happen. It would only take a second, she knew. One second of realization and she’d be able to figure it out again. She tried and\ntried\nbut—\nPisces raised the glass of water Rags brought him and tossed it down, heedless of hygiene. He hesitated and then gently patted Erin on the shoulder.\n“There’s no more magic left in the air. It’s all dissipated, Erin.”\n“Oh.”\nErin stared at her hands. They were still the same hands, but they were somehow smaller, less important. They were good hands, callused from working but unscarred. But they were just hands. Normal.\nPisces cleared his throat. He avoided Erin’s gaze.\n“I’m, ah, sorry, Miss Solstice.”\n“No, it’s okay. I knew magic wasn’t for everyone. And Rags could do it, right?”\nErin smiled at Rags. The Goblin looked up. Somehow, she had found the time to grab some sausage and cheese from Erin’s kitchen. She guiltily hid both behind her back.\n“Eat up. I bet you’re hungry. And you—”\nPisces blinked, but Erin was already out of her seat. She bustled out of the kitchen with blue juice and food in hand and spread it out before him.\n“Here. Lunch and dinner’s on the house.”\n“You are—most kind. Thank you.”\nHe began tearing into the food as if he were famished. And he probably was. Erin looked out the window and saw the sun was now beginning to set rather than rise in the sky. It had taken that long?\nPisces gulped and slurped down his food while Rags did the same. They both seemed starved—probably from the magic. Erin stared blankly at them and then sat down.\n“So, what next?”\nThe Human stopped and eyed Erin warily. Rags kept on shoveling.\n“What, ah, do you mean—”\n“I mean about her. Not me.”\nErin pointed at Rags. The Goblin looked up.\n“She can cast magic, right? Not just her tribal magic, but your kind of magic. She can learn. Will you teach her?”\nPisces’ face went blank. He stared at Rags.\n“Me? Teach?”\n“You were going to teach me a few spells, weren’t you? Well, I can’t cast magic, but Rags can. Will you teach her something?”\nPisces opened his mouth to object, closed it, chewed, and swallowed. His eyes flicked towards the Goblin, towards Erin, and up into the air as he thought rapidly.\n“I’ve—well I’ve never considered having an apprentice. You do know I specialize in necromancy, don’t you? But on the other hand—I am quite proficient in general areas of magic. And of course anyone with a basic grasp of the fundamentals could learn. But a Goblin for a student…?”\n“Tell you what. If you come in every other day and teach her for lessons, I’ll feed you for free. Deal?”\nIt took a few minutes of haggling, but eventually Pisces agreed. Rags had no money to pay him, but he was happy enough to accept free food. And it wasn’t as if Erin ever saw money from him anyways.\nShe left the inn and Pisces beginning to explain the history of magic and the fundamental theories of Magecraft to a bewildered Goblin and walked briskly down the small hill. Her destination was Liscor.\nAfter a few minutes, Erin noticed something following her. She was walking fast enough that the skeleton had to jog to keep up. Erin stopped, and it ran up a few feet behind her and waited patiently. She scowled.\n“It’s you. Go away, you.”\nThe still-unnamed skeleton hesitated. Then it clattered its jaw. Erin glared. She couldn’t understand it, and its understanding of her seemed to be limited.\n“I’m going to visit some friends. Don’t follow me into the city. Wait around the inn while I’m gone. Do something useful. I’ll be back before nightfall.”\nIt hesitated.\n“Go. Shoo!”\nErin pointed and then waved her hands at it as if she were chasing chickens. The skeleton reluctantly turned around and marched back towards the inn.\nErin sighed. Then she continued walking.",

    "text": "She didn’t have any particular destination in mind, she just didn’t want to be in her inn at the moment. So Erin decided to explore parts of the city she’d never been in before. That wasn’t hard. Most of the city was unexplored. She really only knew the shopping district, part of the residential area where Selys lived, and the main street up to the Adventurer’s Guild.\nIt was high time to explore the rest of the city. Erin decided to walk down to the Adventurer’s Guild and work her way out from there. She got about twelve steps before a furry hand yanked her out of the crowd.\n“Ah, Erin Solstice. I have been waiting for you to return, yes?”\nWithout knowing quite what was happening, Erin felt herself being speedily towed along by a large, female Gnoll.\n“You are not busy? We will have drinks in my home.”\n“What? Oh, sure. I’m not busy.”\n“Good! My house is only a few minutes away. Follow me.”\nKrshia let go of Erin, and the Human walked rather than let herself be pulled along. She didn’t hear the quiet sigh of relief from the other Gnolls who’d been watching the gates for her arrival.",

    "text": "Krshia set a large, glistening bowl of chopped meat in front of Erin. It contrasted nicely with the cup of rootish tea in the girl’s hands.\nErin eyed the meat dish, but she’d grown used to Gnolls enough to realize she wasn’t being deliberately insulted.\nWith a sigh, Erin gingerly picked up a strip of meat. It looked…raw to say the least. But if Gnolls could eat it, she probably could. Krshia wouldn’t knowingly serve her poison was Erin’s feeling.\nStill, all of the articles she’d ever read about E. coli and raw meat came back to Erin as she popped the bit of meat into her mouth and chewed.\n“Hm? Hm~. Mm!”\nIt was actually quite good. Erin was surprised. She’d expected the meat to taste like bacon, but it was a fuller, richer experience. Nice and fatty without the actual fat. Immediately, she picked up another cube of meat and chewed it down. She also resolved never to ask what kind of meat it was.\n“Ah, you like the scurry-food? Silkap. You can make it into cubes, or a spread, or many forms. It is quite good.”\nKrshia sat with a sigh on the chair opposite Erin. It was a nice chair too, wonderfully padded if a little worn and far too big for Erin.\nThe apartments of a Gnoll were different from that of a Drake like Selys. Open space was clearly important in both homes—or maybe it was just the architecture, but Krshia’s home had far more rugs, padded furniture, and pillows in general. It was also in a state of slightly less-than-stellar cleaning.\nReally, it wasn’t bad. But Erin had a definite sense that the standards of cleanliness differed between Drakes and Gnolls. Then again, Krshia’s actual shop was clean of any stray hair, dirt, or stains, so maybe it was just the difference between work and home.\n“How are you doing, Krshia?”\nErin delicately sipped at her tea and stuffed her face. Krshia tossed down the meat in her bowl and chewed quickly.\n“Mm. I am well, thank you for asking. And I am relieved to speak with you at last. Many people and many things have gotten in the way of our speaking, yes? But it is important we should speak. So I have decided.”\nErin blinked. Somehow, Krshia seemed a bit more intense than usual. She sighed. Another thing to be worried about.\n“Sure. What’s up?”\nKrshia blinked her great, brown eyes at Erin. She peered at the small Human and frowned.\n“You seem dispirited. Is something wrong?”\n“Oh, it’s nothing.”\n“Mm. This is another polite Human lie, yes?”\n“Yeah, but really, it’s nothing.”\nKrshia stared at Erin. It was odd. She really had no whites in her eyes. It was just pupil and then brown cornea. It should have been disturbing, but Erin had grown used to it.\nShe sighed. Krshia waited patiently as Erin picked at another piece of meat and then put it back in her bowl.\n“I found out I’m not a mage, that’s all. I can’t cast magic, and I won’t ever be able to.”\nShe sighed again. Krshia took a long drink of her scalding tea.\n“Ah. And who is doing the telling of this?”\n“Pisces.”\n“Bah.”\n“He wasn’t mean about it. He did a test—it looks like I’m just one of the Humans who can’t cast magic, that’s all. It’s not his fault or anything.”\nKrshia shook her head. Bits of hair drifted onto her carpet.\n“That is not what I meant. He tells you that you are no mage. It is not for him to decide, yes?”\nErin blinked.\n“But there was a test. I can’t cast magic, Krshia.”\nThe female Gnoll shrugged.\n“If you were born a Gnoll, this would not be an issue, yes? Human magic is different from ours. We give magic to those who are chosen. A [Shaman] for each tribe is chosen, and they wield the magic of all. We choose who can cast magic, not a single person.”\n“Oh, tribal magic. Yeah, Pisces told me about it. But I wasn’t born a Gnoll.”\nKrshia raised one eyebrow.\n“Yes, and so you are told you can never become a mage because one tells you so. It is regrettable, yes?”\nErin didn’t have anything to say to that. She stared down into her tea.\nKrshia clicked her tongue.\n“Enough sadness. This is not why I have called you here. Leave magic for [Mages], Erin. It is not as important as they think. People are important. The tribe is important—if you had one. Without it? I see your friends, like Selys, and even your strange guests like the Antinium and…Goblins as being your tribe. Friendships and ties are important.”\nShe reached out and tapped Erin gently on the chest. It was still a heavy tap, but it made Erin feel better.\n“Okay, sure. What did you want to talk to me about so much, Krshia?”\nThe Gnoll paused and seemed to choose her words.\n“I have been thinking much since I watched you play your game of chess. Against the Antinium named Pawn. Many things you said I heard and wondered at.”\nErin looked blank.\n“Like what? You mean the chess? Don’t worry, no one gets that.”\nFor a second, she could have sworn Krshia was eying her to see if Erin was laughing. But then the Gnoll briskly shook her head again.\n“No. It is what you said. You come from another world. I heard you speak of it and wondered at the miracle.”\nErin’s face was completely blank. Then her eyes widened.\n“I said that?”\nKrshia nodded gravely. Her eyes were fixated on Erin’s face.\nThe Human didn’t seem to know how to react. A brief moment of chagrin was replaced by some head scratching. After a few seconds, Erin looked up and shrugged.\n“Oh, um, yeah. I’m from another world. Sorry I didn’t tell you earlier.”\nKrshia stared. Possibly it was the blasé way Erin said it, without regard to the way it made the Gnoll’s heart skip and jump. Oblivious, Erin continued.\n“I come from a place called Michigan. It’s pretty nice there. Lots of big lakes, wonderful weather—except when it snows or rains really hard, of course. I lived in a nice house, with my folks—”\nShe paused. For a second, Erin stared down into her cup and then continued as if nothing had happened.\n“Um, one day, I found myself here. I just turned a corner and blam.”\n“Blam?”\n“I found myself staring at this big lizard. With wings. A Dragon.”\n“A\nDragon?\n”\n“Yeah. It breathed fire at me, and I ran. Then there were some Goblins…and then I found the inn. After that, it was all survival until I met Klbkch and Relc and then—you know the rest.”\nAgain, there was something off-putting about the way Erin said everything so easily. Krshia had to shake her head several times and take a few more gulps of tea to steady her nerves.\n“You survived much.”\n“I guess.”\nErin shrugged. It didn’t feel like a lot. It felt like a lifetime, actually, but through it all, she’d just kept moving, kept trying to survive. And really, what had she done? Repaired a few doors, swept some dust out, leveled up as an [Innkeeper] a bit…and gotten a friend killed.\nNot much at all.\n“I ask this in confidence. I promise by my tribe and by the open sky and earth that I would never betray your trust or secrets given. But I must ask, and my kin must know. This land you come from—it is not like this one, yes?”\nErin paused and blinked at Krshia. It sounded like a serious oath, but what did Krshia say about her kin?\n“You mean you’re going to tell…other Gnolls?”\nKrshia hesitated and then placed her tea cup down as she nodded.\n“Mm. Yes. If I must, I think it is better to share a secret that is important. And these Gnolls shall tell others if need be. But they shall keep it a secret within our tribe, our people. Your secret shall not be spoken to any not of Gnollkind. That is what I meant. I swear upon Silverfang and the upcoming Meeting of Tribes—we shall not betray your trust. And it will be all Gnolls, all the Gnolls of the Great Plains who hold that secret and support you, if need be.”\nA promise by an entire species to keep silent. Erin would have laughed, but she felt that might actually result in violence. Krshia looked serious, and Erin thought the Gnoll was serious.\nAnd—what did Erin have to lose? Besides her life? So she shrugged.\n“My world? It’s not like this one. Not at all. It’s so different I can’t even explain how strange it is to be here.”\n“Mm. How so? Eat, drink. But tell me. I am very curious.”\nHow did you describe a world without magic and levels to someone who didn’t even exist in your world? For that matter, how would you describe a world a thousand years more advanced? Erin scratched at her head and did her best.\n“Well—we’ve got a lot more technology. And less magic. No magic, actually. And we don’t have Levels or Classes or Skills, but we do have a lot more Humans. Actually, we have only Humans. There aren’t any Gnolls or Drakes or any monsters where I come from. And—are you okay, Krshia?”\nThe Gnoll’s eyes were bugging out in her head. It was such an alarming change from the Gnoll’s usually half-lidded stare that Erin was worried.\n“Take no mind of me. G-go on.”\nKrshia drained her cup and dragged over a large and dented tea pot. She refilled her cup with furry hands that shook and offered Erin a refill. The Human politely waved the tea away.\n“You say this is a world full of Humans? That is strange, yes? Are there no other creatures?”\nErin nodded and hastily amended her sentence.\n“Oh tons of creatures. Lots of animals. Dogs, cats, penguins, cows…but just no people like—like you. People who think and speak is what I mean.”\n“I…see…”\nKrshia’s head was throbbing. The Gnoll would have loved nothing better than to sit in a corner and bang her head against a wall just imagining what Erin was saying. Better yet, she would have loved to overturn the table and call Erin a tail-biting liar. But [Spot Deception] was a [Merchant] and a [Shopkeeper]’s skill, and if it wasn’t as good as [Detect Guilt] or [Sense Intentions], it was still more than a match for a large falsehood. What Erin was saying was true.\n“These Humans. You Humans.”\nKrshia stumbled over her tongue and tried to speak casually.\n“How many of them are there? How many nations? Is it a small world?”\n“Sorta? It feels small sometimes. I know overpopulation is an issue.”\nErin rolled her eyes upwards as she thought.\n“Um, is it six or seven? Seven? I think we’re supposed to have eight sometime soon.”\n“Eight what? Eight countries?”\n“No, eight billion Humans.”\nKrshia looked blank.\n“I do not know this word. Erin, what is a ‘billion’? It is a counting number, yes?”\n“Yeah. Do you know, um, million?”\nThe Gnoll’s brows scrunched together.\n“It is a word I heard with Goblins. A million is a large number. Larger than mountains. A thousand thousands, yes?”\n“…Yes? I think so. Wait…let me do the math.”\nErin tried to imagine how many zeros were in a million.\n“Yeah. That’s about right.”\n“Mm. Then is a billion two millions?”\n“Oh, no.”\nErin laughed at Krshia’s confusion. She didn’t notice the Gnoll’s hand trembling on her cup.\n“A billion is a thousand millions. So that’d be a thousand thousand thousands. What a tongue twister. It’d be…a hundred thousand ten thousand times. Does that make sense?”\nErin looked at Krshia. The Gnoll was sitting very still in her chair.\n“Krshia?”\nGnolls didn’t have any visible skin, just fur. But her ears were standing straight up on her head. Between the slats in her chair, Erin could see the Gnoll’s tail was fully erect as well.\nWithout a word, and without a single hint of warning, the Gnoll suddenly tipped forwards in her chair in a dead faint. Erin yelped and dove just in time as Krshia crashed into her table, shattering porcelain and upending the kettle of tea.\n“Krshia, what’s wrong?”\nErin bent over the unconscious Gnoll and, with great effort, tilted her upright. The shards of broken pottery hadn’t even cut the Gnoll through her fur, but Krshia was still unconscious. Only the—well, the blacks of Krshia’s eyes were showing.\n“Are you okay? What happened? Speak to me, Krshia.”\nBut no matter how hard Erin shook the Gnoll, she didn’t come round. Desperately, Erin propped Krshia up against her chair and wavered between going for help and waiting for Krshia to wake up. It didn’t seem like she’d been hurt.\nErin sat among the spilled meat and cooling tea. Her heart still hurt, but mercifully, she had something to panic about. She put her head in her hands.\n“Why does this keep happening to me?”\nWhy had Krshia wanted to talk to her, anyways? It probably wasn’t best to tell her about her world—at least the parts about hyenas being hunted—or all the other bad parts, really. She’d been so interested. And Erin had remembered—\nShe cut her brain off as it thought of home. No. Focus. Krshia was important. If she didn’t wake up in ten minutes, Erin would go get someone. Another Gnoll, probably. She’d been seeing more of them around than normal.\nBut why had Krshia fainted? If that was what had happened.\n“Why?”\nErin shook her head. She had no idea. But—\n“Was it something I said?”\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "When Krshia came round, she did so dramatically. Erin had fussed over her for a few minutes before realizing there was no way she was going to be able to pick the Gnoll woman up. She was twice Erin’s weight, and her fur made her look even bigger. So Erin just sat and scrutinized her.\nShe really was sort of a woman of the tribes, right? For all she was a [Shopkeeper], Krshia apparently knew how to shoot a bow, and she had lived most her life outside the walls of a city. Gnolls had light, sparse clothing mostly, and they seemed to like hunting and such.\nPerhaps Gnolls weren’t as—as civilized as other races. But of course that was the wrong thing for Erin to think. It was more that Gnolls still lived in close proximity to monsters, even more so than Drakes did. They had to be ready to defend themselves in case one attacked their villages. That was probably why when Krshia sat up gasping, her claws popped out of her paws and she nearly took Erin’s head off.\nIt was an accident. Erin was nearly 100% sure of that. And Krshia\nhad\napologized several times.\nAfter they’d patched up Erin’s cheek and poured a tiny bit of healing potion on the cut to make it heal faster, the Gnoll and Human cleaned up the broken table and spilled tea. Then they began the tea party again, only with less party and very cold tea.\nKrshia had some lovely cheese that Erin didn’t mind snacking on. It was wonderfully sharp, and the tea wasn’t half bad, even after it had cooled.\n“Apologies again, Erin.”\nThe large Gnoll sighed as she lowered herself back into her chair and kicked the remnants of her coffee table aside. The replacement she’d brought was a footstool, which she balanced the platter of cheese on.\n“It was nothing. Really. But why did you faint?”\n“Mm. I was merely surprised. Forgive me.”\nKrshia took a drink from her tea and shuddered for a second.\n“The Humans on your planet—I was not prepared for such a number.”\n“What? Oh, you mean eight billion? I guess that’s a lot.”\n“It is.”\n“Ah. Um. Was it\nthat\nsurprising?”\nErin’s complete incomprehension gave Krshia a gentle urge to smack her. But Humans were fragile, so though her paw twitched, she kept her voice pleasant.\n“It may have been shock or perhaps it was something I ate, yes?”\nThe young woman glanced at the bowl of meats she still hadn’t finished.\n“I sure hope not.”\n“That was a joke.”\nKrshia shook her head. Humans really had no sense of humor. They could never tell when she was being ironic, sardonic, sarcastic, or just teasing them. Their faces were easy to read on, the other paw.\n“Let us put the interruption behind us. You were telling me about your world. It has many people—this I now realize. But what else is different?”\nErin frowned, scratched at her ear with one finger, and shrugged helplessly.\n“Uh, everything? I mean, most things. We’ve got mountains and water and stuff like you guys, but in terms of technology or buildings or…everything’s different.”\nKrshia leaned forwards.\n“I would like to know details of these differences. Can you give me a few important changes between our worlds? Besides the lack of Levels and Classes.”\n“Well—there’s a lot to say. I mean, we’ve got such different cultures. Ours is more adv—more\ndifferent\nin many ways. Like—we have weapons and you have weapons, but ours are more shooty.”\n“Shooty?”\n“Yeah. Like ‘blam’.”\nErin made a gun with her fingers and pointed while making the sound. Krshia blinked at her, uncomprehending.\n“What I mean is, we don’t use swords. Or axes. We have guns. They’re, uh, sort of like crossbows but better? Do you know what crossbows are?”\n“I…see. Yes, I have heard of crossbows. I know them decently well, though bows—I am familiar with in their many forms. Crossbows. Hrr. And you have many of these weapons? They are powerful, yes?”\n“Yeah. But we don’t use them on monsters. We just kill each other with them. And we don’t use horses—well we\ndo\nuse horses, but we also have other ways to travel. Like cars.”\nIn some ways, fainting had been more relaxing for Krshia than talking to Erin. Her head was beginning to hurt.\n“Cars? What are these creatures?”\n“They’re not animals. They’re, uh, moving, metal boxes. On wheels.”\n“You—push them around, yes?”\n“No…it’s more like they move because we burn stuff inside them. Combustion. They drive themselves. Well I mean, they don’t\ndrive\nthemselves. You need a Human in one to drive it. But some of the newer cars can drive themselves. But most can’t. And they need fuel. Gasoline. That’s a type of oil, I think.”\nErin looked helplessly at Krshia. The Gnoll was massaging her temples.\n“Um. Did any of that make sense?”",

    "text": "They tried for another half hour before they gave up. Erin did her best, but she really didn’t know how half of the things in her world worked. Her best explanation of cars was that they had some kind of engine-creature in its stomach that ate oil and made the car move faster than a horse. And she had no idea how planes actually flew, especially when Krshia kept asking her how something that was made of metal could ever fly without magic.\nIt wasn’t as if Erin had\nfailed\nscience class or didn’t know how things worked. But she hadn’t exactly taken Engineering 101 either. In fact, she hadn’t gone into college, preferring to work as a chess tutor and tournament contender to save up money before she enrolled.\nAll of that meant—well, it just meant that while Erin could tell Krshia a lot of fantastical things, it sounded like she was making everything up. And Krshia was clearly distracted. She kept rubbing at her head for one thing. Erin guessed she’d hit it pretty hard when she fell over.\n“Enough, enough. I am weary, and you are thirsty. Drink, and let us talk of other things for the moment.”\nErin nodded and accepted a refill of the new batch of tea Krshia had brewed while they spoke. She eyed the Gnoll.\n“Well, I guess I can’t really explain my world that well. But your world is equally strange to me. Stuff like magic—that’s just fairy tales in my world.”\n“Ah, you have…Winter Sprites? I have heard a few call them ‘faeries’.”\n“No, I…you know what? Forget it. I’m just saying we don’t have magic. So when I came here, I had no idea how anything worked.”\n“Hmm. I remember. You were lost and very afraid, then. But you have done well since, yes?”\n“I guess.”\n“There is no guessing. I have seen how you have improved and made this land your home. We have witnessed your triumphs. We have seen your victories. They are to be proud of, Erin Solstice.”\nErin sighed and shook her head in denial. Then, suddenly, she looked up at Krshia. A flicker of suspicion crossed her face.\n“Krshia? Why\ndid\nyou want to talk with me about my world?”\nKrshia thought fast while keeping her face straight. She answered carefully.\n“I was simply curious. It is natural to question such statements, is it not?”\n“I guess. But you just said you’d been watching me. And you said ‘we’. Is that why I keep seeing a bunch of Gnolls wherever I go?”\nFor a Human, Erin was surprisingly perceptive at times. Krshia cursed her slip of the tongue and kept a straight face. But Erin had played too many games of chess. She could see when someone had on a poker face. Her eyes narrowed.\n“Right. I guess it’s time for my questions. Krshia, what do the Gnolls want with me?”\nKrshia tapped her claw against her teacup. Again, she chose her next sentence with extreme care, as if she were negotiating a sale worth hundreds of gold pieces.\n“The Gnolls who live in Liscor have many desires. We hoped—that there might be some things that one such as you could help us with. But that is only part of the reason I asked you here. The other part was to ask a question. What does Erin Solstice want?”\nErin blinked as the question came straight back at her.\n“What do I want?”\n“Everything is give and take, yes? We would give much for knowledge. Items of worth. Things that could help our people. But all things have a price. We would help you grant your desires if you had something to offer in exchange.”\n“I don’t have anything to give you. Besides food. But I buy that from you.”\n“It may be you do not realize your own worth. A stranger from a far-off land has many secrets, many skills of worth she does not know she possesses, yes?”\n“Maybe. I doubt it, though.”\n“Regardless. I asked you a question. What is it you wish? If possible, we would help you. Or if my tribe disagrees, I would help you not as one seeking a bargain but as a friend.”\nErin smiled at Krshia.\n“Well, when you put it like that—I still don’t know.”\nKrshia frowned.\n“There are many things Humans want. Surely you have the same wishes, yes? Do you want money?”\n“What would I use it on? Repairing the inn? I guess money’d be nice, but I’m okay.”\n“Hrm. Then do you wish for more levels? Better weapons? These things many Humans desire. Or—an attractive mate? A fertile one?”\n“No, no, no, and definitely\nno.\nI’m not interested in any of that. Really. I already have a lot of those adventurers chatting me up in the street.”\n“Hrrm.”\nThis was tricky. Krshia had already run through all the things she would have wanted. Erin didn’t exactly seem like she was too interested in mating at the moment, and she was no warrior—at least, she didn’t\nlike\nfighting. But neither was she happy.\n“Then what is it you wish?”\nErin shrugged. She stared at her half-empty tea cup, at the ceiling, around Krshia’s room—and then she seemed to realize what she was missing. She looked at Krshia.\n“I want to go home.”\nIt was a simple sentence, delivered casually. But the wave of emotion Krshia smelled coming off of Erin told an entirely different story. The Gnoll shopkeeper had a strong desire to wrinkle her nose or rub at it, but that would have given her away.\n“I see. But if you have not returned already, you do not know the way back, yes?”\n“Yes—I mean, no. I don’t.”\nErin shook her head, distracted. Now that she’d said what was in her heart, her entire demeanor had changed. Her body language was shifting, and the turmoil of emotions within her was making Krshia’s nose\ntwitch.\n“This desire of yours. You wish for it strongly, yes?”\n“No.”\nErin lied and then corrected her lie as Krshia raised one eyebrow.\n“Maybe.\nYes.\nI don’t want to insult this place. It’s a beautiful world you have here, Krshia. It really is more amazing than anything from my world. And I’ve made friends. Selys, Pawn, you…even Pisces. All that’s good, but—”\nShe paused and then looked down into her cup. Erin’s voice was quiet.\n“I have family back home. My mom and my dad. I can’t believe I don’t think of them more often, but I guess I’m just trying to stay sane here. And I had friends. It’s not like I miss them most of the time—I try not to think about it. But…I didn’t even get to say goodbye, y’know?”\nFor two seconds, it looked as if she would break. Erin blinked rapidly and brushed at her eyes. But the tears never fell. She sighed, and the moment was past.\n“Sorry. It’s just—I’d really like to go home. If I could. I know it might be impossible. I don’t even know if it was some kind of spell or a…a cosmic accident that brought me here. But if I could, I want to go home.”\nKrshia stared at Erin, her dark eyes unblinking. She said nothing out loud, but she was thinking. For a second, the bright, cheerful nature of Erin had broken. It was a mask, a layer of protection around her heart. She was strong, but fragile, like the Antinium were underneath their shells. Her hide was tough. But it would all break down if Krshia\npushed\njust a tiny bit—\nThe Gnoll pretended nothing had happened and went on talking until Erin’s emotions were fully back under her control. Now was not the time for such things.\n“It may have been magic. Perhaps. I do not know such things. I am merely a [Shopkeeper]. But I have never heard of one crossing from other worlds through a spell. That is the stuff of legends, creating magical dimensions and crossing betwixt them. But there are many magics that teleport. Perhaps a truly great [Mage] may have used such a spell by accident or mistake.”\nErin frowned speculatively.\n“Maybe. It didn’t\nfeel\nlike magic back then. But I’ve never been teleported, so maybe it was magic and I just didn’t notice. It really felt like an accident.”\n“Accident or not, you are here. And perhaps the cause is irrelevant, yes? You are here. The question is not what brought you here, but how you may return.”\n“And is magic the answer?”\n“Most likely. I would not know of any other way. But as I have said, it would take a [Mage], no—an [Archmage] to cast such a spell, if it can be done.”\n“Right. You wouldn’t happen to have one of those lying around, would you?”\nKrshia shook her head.\n“They are the rarest of spellcasters. I know of only a few, and none live on this continent. Nor are they [Archmages] proper…but they are the best you could ask for, for magical help.”\n“Great.”\nErin shook her head. Krshia smiled.\n“Do not despair before even hearing of them, yes? Listen. There are several archmages. One on the Human continent to the north. Two more on other continents. But at least three have homes in Wistram, the Isle of Mages.”\nErin perked up at that.\n“Really? Three?”\n“They come and go. But Wistram is their home. If you waited there for a month, you would surely see at least one, yes? And perhaps it is not an Archmage you need but the right spell.”\n“So what you’re saying is that Wistram is the place I would want to go if I wanted to find out about getting home, right?”\n“Mm. Perhaps.”\nErin frowned because Krshia was frowning.\n“What’s wrong?”\n“It is nothing. I am sure if you travelled to Wistram they would allow you entry. But it is not such a good place that I would tell you to travel alone, yes?”\n“Really? But I thought it was like Hogw—a, uh, school for mages. Wouldn’t it be safe and full of cool spells and stuff?”\nKrshia flicked her fingers dismissively.\n“Perhaps some may call it so. But your Pisces, he graduated from Wistram did he not? And he is a [Necromancer] and a thief and gravedigger.”\n“Well, when you put it that way…”\n“And Wistram is made up of many Humans, yes? They are petty and squabble as many of your kind do. Non-humans live among them, of course, but it is no haven. Wistram is no friend to the magicless.”\nA dark frown crossed Krshia’s face. Erin sat still, remembering to breathe. She’d forgotten how scary Gnolls could be. On one hand, they were like giant teddy bears, but on the other hand, they greatly resembled giant teddy bears, complete with razor-sharp claws.\n“Did something happen to you, Krshia? Did you—did you ever go to Wistram?”\n“I?”\nKrshia sniffed dismissively and shook her head.\n“I would not visit such a place. Nor would any of my kind, even to trade and earn money. We do not deal with those fools.”\n“Fools?”\nKrshia shook her head.\n“It is an old story. I would not trouble you with it, Erin.”\n“No, tell me. Please. I’m interested.”\nThe Gnoll hesitated, but Erin was openly earnest. And because it was clearly upsetting her, Krshia told the story.\n“Wistram is a place of magic. It is the place for mages to go and learn, yes? Other cities have their own guilds and even schools, and some nations pay for mages to learn and serve. But Wistram is nationless and a nation unto itself. They have never bowed to any ruler and never shall. So they are thought of well by all who practice magic. But they are fools.”\nHer fingers clenched on her tea cup and relaxed before they could shatter the delicate porcelain.\n“Nearly forty years ago, the Gnoll tribes gathered to talk and forge alliances and plans for the future. It is done every twenty years, and it is an important time. At that time, we had heard much of Wistram, and many among us wished for Gnolls to learn such secrets as the Academy teaches. It is said that Gnolls cannot be [Mages]—well, why not test that theory? No Gnoll had ever taught themselves magic, but tribe Weatherfur suggested we ask the greatest teachers in the world if there is even a chance it could be done. Sensible, yes?”\nErin sat in her chair, listening to Krshia’s rumbling voice and thinking. She already thought she knew how the story ended, but she wondered other things. Had Krshia been there? How old was she? And—what did the Gnolls want? But Krshia went on, and Erin was sucked into her story.\n“It was decided that the tribes would send one of our finest young [Shamans] to Wistram to ask admission. We chose one who was young but was talented beyond his years and gave him magical artifacts from each tribe and much coin to make the journey. Our warriors took him to a port city, and he took a ship to Wistram, braving storms and pirates on his long journey.”\nIf it was possible, Krshia’s expression turned even angrier. Her hackles raised. Erin watched as the hair on the back of Krshia’s neck stood upright, fascinated.\n“The mages at Wistram gave the Gnoll a test when he asked to be entered into the Academy. They did not believe him when he claimed to be a spellcaster as they were. They asked him to cast spells, but he was alone, yes? Alone, and without any to draw on. Without any others, there is no magic to cast for [Shamans]. That is why he asked to be taught as a normal student. But the mages, they did not listen. They cast him out and declared all Gnolls to be magic-deficient. Talentless.”\nKrshia growled and spat. Erin stared at the glob of spit dripping from one of the Gnoll’s dressers and wondered if she were going to clean that up later.\n“That is why to this day [Mages] from Wistram are not welcome among the tribes and why we do not trade with their island. And that is why even if you go, you must not trust them, Erin Solstice. The mages of Wistram do not trust any who do not have magic they recognize.”\nErin nodded. Krshia’s story sounded like a case of good old-fashioned racism or maybe just ignorance. Either way, she understood the Gnoll’s ire. But it didn’t change things.\n“I’d still like to talk to a mage. Or—a mage besides Pisces, at least.”\nKrshia shrugged, tired from telling her story.\n“There are several in the city. But Drake mages, the strong ones, fight with their army, yes? And magic is not as widely practiced in these lands. Perhaps you would find one wise enough to help you, but you would search long.”\n“So Wistram’s my only option? I mean, I’m not saying I’d just get up and head over there but—”\n“If you wish to return home, that may be your best choice.”\nErin sat still for a while, staring into her tea cup. She raised it to her lips and took a long drink of the bitter and now cold tea.\n“Okay. Okay. That’s—that’s something to aim for, at least.”\n“It is good to have a goal. And perhaps that is something we may assist you with.”\n“Really? I mean, why? And how? Is it that hard to get to Wistram?”\nKrshia shrugged.\n“Perhaps not hard for one with much coin, but it is a long ways away and dangerous for a lone Human female who is not a warrior, and even one who is, yes? Anyone may attempt the journey to Wistram, but it is another thing to make the journey and survive.”\nThat\ndidn’t sound good. At all. Erin frowned.\n“What’s so hard about it? You hire a carriage, get to a port city, jump on a boat, and you’re nearly there, right?”\nKrshia laughed quietly and tapped Erin on the shoulder. Again, Gnolls had a\nheavy\ntap that was more like a shove.\n“It is good to be young and eager. But it is not good to stop thinking, yes? Wistram is protected by more than mages. The seas around the college are calm at times, but at other times, they devour ships and sink fleets. Especially in the winter.”\nShe shook her head at Erin.\n“Even if you left now, winter would freeze you at sea as you travelled west, and the storms would crack the hull of any ship foolish enough to brave the oceans. And there is the cost to consider as well.”\n“Oh, right. Hiring a ship would be really expensive, right?”\n“You would seek passage on a ship to Wistram. That would not be as expensive, but I talk of the cost of the journey. To travel north to the port cities safely would require joining a caravan that hires adventurers. That costs coin. A good place on a good ship with an able captain requires coin. A bodyguard or one who would protect you costs coin. And seeking lodging in Wistram—”\n“I get it. It costs a lot of coin, right?”\nKrshia sniffed at Erin and flicked her forehead lightly like one would a child. Only in this case it really\nhurt.\n“Ow! Stop that! Your claws are sharp!”\n“Apologies. But you are still not thinking. Say you reach Wistram after travelling so far. Tell me, Erin Solstice, how do you plan on finding a mage to bring you home?”\n“Well…”\nErin paused and blinked.",

    "text": "“I, uh, hadn’t thought of that. I guess I’d just go to their headmaster and ask for help?”\nKrshia laughed hard and long.\n“That would be a sight to see. Yes, and talking to such a leader among mages would be an achievement in itself if he even existed! Wistram has a Council and its Archmages. You might find many influential persons, but why would they listen? You are just a child speaking of other worlds. Even if you could prove your truth, which is simple enough, how would you convince them to help you?”\n“Well—I’m from another world. Isn’t that enough?”\n“Perhaps to some. But while I believe you—how would you prove it to them? And even assuming they wished to help—do you think Wistram does anything for free?”\nErin’s heart sank.\n“So you’re saying I’d need to pay a mage to help me?”\nKrshia nodded. Well, she nodded, shrugged, and seemed unclear.\n“I am not one to make idle promises, Erin Solstice. Many\nmight\nhelp you for free, but you would not like me if you had gone to Wistram only to find no one willing to hear you unless you had gold to pay them, eh? To be certain, either have the funds to buy a mage to assist you or to find a mage worthy and willing to help you. That is the real cost I speak of.”\nThings were never so simple as they were in books. It was Erin’s turn to rub at her head with her hands. If this were Harry Potter, she’d be able to walk up to Diagon Alley and—well, she was a muggle and she’d forgotten the password, so they wouldn’t let her in, and even if she did walk around asking people if they were wizards—\n“This sucks. You’re telling me I have to\npay\nto go home?”\n“Is it not always so?”\nErin scowled at Krshia, but the Gnoll just smiled back. Erin reluctantly began to think, counting off on her fingers.\n“Okay. Say that is my goal. How much money would I need, do you think? A hundred gold pieces for the journey? And then maybe another hundred pieces to find a place to stay? And—um, let’s call it six hundred for finding a mage willing to help me? That’s…a lot.”\n“Too much, I think.”\nKrshia shook her head at Erin.\n“You have no idea of pricing, yes? For sixty pieces perhaps I could bring you to Wistram. It would be a longer journey, and you would need to find one to guard you. But it could be done. And a hundred gold pieces would last you several years even in Wistram. But the real price is in the mage.”\nErin’s heart sunk even lower.\n“Six hundred gold pieces not enough?”\n“It is not about money. Mages have much money, and offering to pay them may work or it may not. Your money would be of little interest to all but the lowest-level ones. They are not what you want, I am thinking.”\n“No, definitely not.”\n“We spoke of archmages, yes? They are the ones you seek. Finding an audience with them through wit or bribery—that is your challenge. For that, I would take as much money as I could bring and something to attract their attention.”\nErin sat back in her chair, overwhelmed at the idea—not to mention the cost. Krshia laughed again.\n“Do not despair. These things seem large, but they are not overwhelming, yes? Sit. Drink. And let me talk to you of what the Gnolls might do. And what you may do for us.”\nErin sat back in her chair as Krshia stood up. She let the Gnoll bustle around her home, refilling Erin’s cup with more tea, offering her more food and thought. She thought about the journey, what Krshia was proposing, and the danger and difficulty involved at every step. But she also thought of something else.\nShe remembered a quiet home, two people she knew she could go to with every worry. She thought of her bed, her friends. She thought of home and realized that was where she really wanted to go.",

    "text": "When Erin walked out of Krshia’s home, it was nearly nightfall. The Gnoll insisted she walk Erin back to the gates, and it was only with some convincing that Erin told her she’d be fine on the way back. She’d spotted a shiny, bald…head with no hair or even skin attached hiding on a nearby hillside, and she didn’t want the Gnoll to freak out.\nIt would have taken a lot for Krshia to freak out at this stage anyways, even if she’d known how to freak out properly. It had been a long conversation Erin and Krshia had had, ranging from the logistics of how one might travel from Liscor all the way to Wistram Academy, hundreds—perhaps thousands of miles away. Erin had forgotten to ask the exact distances, probably because she was too afraid to.\nBut between talk of money and the journey, Krshia had talked with Erin about her world and extracted a promise for the Human girl to tell her more at another time. That had been what had set the Gnoll’s stomach jumping and was the main reason she didn’t pick up on the dead smell of bones, magic, and marrow blowing her way.\nShe watched Erin disappear into the night, ignoring the gate guard until the Human had crested a hill. She could hear Erin shouting something, but she was too far away at that point even for the Gnoll’s ears to pick up what she was saying.\nOnly then did Krshia turn to the guard at the gates who was deliberately ignoring her and nudge him.\n“There is no one watching. You can drop the act, Tkrn. You are a terrible pretender of things in any case.”\nTkrn, the Gnoll guardsman who had been assigned to the gates for the last few days in a row, grinned toothily at Krshia.\n“Aunt,\nfinally!\nI was wondering if you were going to stab Erin or call for help. If she really was a [Spy] from Terandria or something.”\nKrshia scowled at the other Gnoll and jabbed him in the ribs. Hard. Even though the other Gnoll was wearing chainmail, he still winced.\n“I told you it would not come to that. And you and the others are fools for suggesting it and dreaming her disappearance would not be noticed. Kill a lost child?”\nTkrn scowled and rubbed at his side sulkily. But he didn’t dare talk back. Instead, he cast his eyes to where Erin had disappeared.\n“I just—it was a joke! Anyways, she’s really what she seems to be?”\nKrshia snorted.\n“As I have said, so it is. She is no threat; merely a lost one seeking to return home.”\nTkrn shook his head.\n“So it is true? She\nis\nfrom another world?”\n“I sense the truth of it. Yes, she is one who came here by mistake.”\nAgain, the other Gnoll shook his head in disbelief.\n“When I first smelled her, she stank of a place full of oil and metal and burning. Is her world like that?”\nKrshia paused, thinking.\n“From what she said—and did not say—it is a world of Humans. They alone live in it. Whether that is a better one than this I do not know.”\n“But it is different.”\n“Yes. Very. In ways that are disturbing and grand. But she did not speak much of these differences, and I understood less. But she is—useful. She is important.”\n“But she wants to go home, too. So we’re the only ones who can help her. Which means we get to ask favors of her, right? Maybe even present her to the Meeting of Tribes for Silverfang’s honor?”\nKrshia gave Tkrn a baleful look, and he wilted.\n“You were supposed to be looking out for other listeners, not eavesdropping, fool. What point is there hearing what I will tell the others anyways?”\n“But it doesn’t matter, does it? No one was listening that I saw.”\nTkrn whined at Krshia, but the other Gnoll didn’t relent. She shook her head.\n“We need Erin Solstice more than she needs us, yes? And we do not want her speaking with others who would know her value.”\nKrshia prodded Tkrn none-too-gently in the chest.\n“So be more alert! When she comes back, I wish to know. And tonight, ask one of the Runners. Lv or Tshana. They must send a message to the tribes.”\nTkrn looked up. That was serious. He listened carefully as Krshia spoke.\n“They must send more of our people here. Wise ones. I ask for counsel as well, of all I have learned. I will speak with all those in the city as soon as all can be gathered and send a second Runner. But this first one must go at once.”\n“Will you ask anything else of them?”\n“Ask them if they have found others such as Erin. And if they have not found them, tell them to search! Tell them to look among Humans for ones who stand out and speak and act differently.”\nTkrn straightened and nodded. He had a sword at his waist and a shield buckled to one arm. But he would have been dangerous without either weapon. Well. Moderately dangerous. His eyes glinted in the moonlight.\n“Do you want me to gather some others to watch over her inn? We could set up camp a few miles away in secret. Watch Captain Zevara will notice if I’m off-duty, but the others could work in shifts.”\nAgain, for his trouble, Tkrn earned another elbow that made him wince. Krshia flattened her ears and glared at him.\n“You are foolish, Tkrn. Just like a cub on his first hunt. If we place others around her inn, she will notice, yes? But before she does,\nothers\nwill notice and ask questions. And we have few warriors in the city as it is.”\nTkrn whined. He didn’t like speaking to Krshia, especially because the punishment for making mistakes was so painful.\n“How can we protect her if we cannot be seen near her?”\nKrshia didn’t turn as she strode away. She spoke briskly over her shoulder as she went to talk with other Gnolls.\n“How else? We give her the means to protect herself.”",

    "text": "Toren was being chastised. Or rather, Toren was being yelled at. It was pretty much the same thing, but volume was the key difference here.\nErin walked through the grass back towards her inn, snapping at the skeleton as it meekly followed her, fish in hand.\n“Why did you come all the way out here? Do you know what would have happened if the guard had seen you? He would have smashed you to bits, and I would have probably gotten in trouble. Somehow.”\nToren the skeleton didn’t say anything. It couldn’t, but it wouldn’t even if it could. It felt bad, but also good, which was a confusing feeling. Bad because Erin was mad at it, but good because it had a name.\nToren. No last name. Although why the skeleton would want two names was beyond it. But Erin had told it that was its name. Toren. It meant rook in another language, but what a rook was Toren had no idea. It was just a piece of carved stone on the board Erin liked to stare at so much.\nErin stormed through the grass, Toren meekly following in her wake. Her anger at the skeleton was rapidly dissipating, mainly because it was just taking all of her abuse. But her temper flared every time she looked back and saw the skeleton carrying the massive, and very dead, flat fish.\n“And what were you thinking?\nWere\nyou even thinking? Can you even think? Why would you think grabbing one of those stupid fish was a good idea?”\nToren bowed its head meekly and made no reply. The dead fish he carried in both his arms flopped around as he followed her.\nReally, the skeleton hadn’t intended to kill the fish. It had leapt out at him while he’d been filling the buckets with water. But by dragging it away from its watery home, Toren had learned an important lesson: fish couldn’t breathe without water.\nIt hadn’t been sure if the flat fish were truly dangerous, but the skeleton was aware of their crushing strength and lethally sharp teeth. Moreover the skeleton now known as Toren had felt there was something valuable to be gained. It was—yes, it was Level 2 already from battling the adventurers. Perhaps it could gain another level by killing fish?\nAfter all, a level wasn’t much, especially at lower-levels. But the skeleton had felt the slight shift in its overall coordination, strength, endurance, and overall fighting ability. The connection was simple in its mind. Levels were strength. So too was the [Basic Weapon Proficiency: Swords] Skill it had acquired.\nIt had orders. Do something productive. That could mean kill fish. So the skeleton had stuck its arm into the water and moved it around enticingly. Killing things was easy. Not like cleaning.\nThus, it had killed several of the large fish and taken them back to the inn. And it had brought one for Erin as something ‘useful’. Clearly, it had failed.\n“Look, it’s not that I don’t like fish. I like fish. Dead fish that have a bit of lemon juice squeezed over the top after they’ve been roasted nicely. And maybe a bit of salt and pepper. I like those kinds of fish. But\nthis\nfish is bad news. I tried cutting its scales off once and nearly sliced my hand off.”\nThat sounded like a problem, but Toren wasn’t sure what it was expected to do about it.\nErin kicked the door to her inn open, stopped as her nose registered the fishy smell, and turned to glare at Toren. The skeleton flinched back from her. Erin stormed into the kitchen, and her exclamation nearly rattled the floorboards.\n“What is\nthis?\n”\nFish were easy to catch, especially since Toren didn’t mind if they latched onto its arm. But they were hard to get off, so Toren had to hack at them with its sword. Thus, the fish in Erin’s kitchen weren’t so much dead as…\nDisassembled.\nThe fish Toren was holding was the only one that was even close to intact. The other…bits Toren had carefully collected, washed to remove dirt and blood, and then deposited in a neat heaping pile on one of the cutting boards in the kitchen.\nThe fish guts dripped onto the floor. Toren automatically put down its fish on the counter and went to clean up the puddle of bloody water.\n“Stop that.”\nThe skeleton paused with the rag in its hand as Erin rubbed at her face and tried not to scream. It could sense Erin was angry, but it clearly had no idea why. Erin sighed and pointed at the dead fish.\n“You did this.”\nThe skeleton nodded.\n“I think I get it. You wanted to be helpful. This is food. Which is…helpful, right?”\nAnother nod. Erin sighed.\n“But look—I can’t eat this. No one can. Not even the G—well, maybe the Goblins. But we don’t eat food like…”\nShe waved at the mess of fish. Toren appeared confused.\n“It’s the scales. See these?”\nErin pointed to the sharp, glittering scales lying all over the counter.\n“They’re not tasty. And these ones are\nsharp.\nIf we want to eat the fish, you have to get rid of the scales. And I—I can’t do it. Seriously. Like I said, last time…”\nErin broke off. The skeleton—she kept forgetting she’d named him Toren—was nodding. It dropped the rag, walked over, and grabbed a knife. Then it grabbed the fish it had taken and raised the knife.\nIt had no cooking skills and probably no idea what cooking even was. It hacked energetically and completely ineffectually at the fish with the knife. Scales and guts went flying everywhere. Erin covered her face and yelped as the skeleton cut, pried, and generally ripped the scales and much of the flesh right off the fish.\n“Stop, stop!”\nToren paused and looked over at her. Erin pointed.\n“\nOutside.\nDo that\noutside\n, on a table or something. And after that, clean up—no, nevermind. I’ll clean up this mess, you start getting rid of those scales, okay?”\nThe skeleton nodded. It carefully stuck the kitchen knife between its ribs to hold it in place, lifted the huge fish with both hands, and walked out of the kitchen with it. Erin stared until she heard the\nscreech\nof wood on wood as the skeleton began dragging a table towards the door.\n“I—don’t even know. I just don’t know.”\nShe stared down at the mess of scales and blood on the kitchen floor, then at the pile of eviscerated fish parts. It was a mess.\nBut—was it because they were disassembled? Somehow, Erin could tell what she could do with the fish guts now that they were in manageable pieces. Without the scales, she could fry them, use them in soups, bake them after breading them…\n“I guess [Basic Cooking] doesn’t include scale removal. Or—scale removal on killer fish.”\nThat reminded Erin. She walked back to the entrance of the kitchen and called outside.\n“Get rid of the teeth, bones, and fins too!”\nShe heard no response, but she was beginning to not expect one. With a sigh, Erin walked back into her kitchen and stared at the mess.\nIt really wasn’t that hard to clean up. And the skeleton\nhad\nfound a new food source. Or rather, it had transformed an old food source into an actual source of food. For her. It had done it for her.\nThat was nice. And Erin had finally thought of a name for it thanks to all the online chess games and conversations she’d had with foreign players. The Dutch had some pretty cool names.\nIt was all fine. Even her conversation with Krshia—\n“Wasn’t that weird?”\nErin murmured to herself as she began separating the obviously unusable parts of the fish on the cutting board. The guts\nsquelched\nhorribly, but her mind was elsewhere.\nHome. She really had tried not to think of it. But now that she had, it called to her. And it was still so far away. A mage? An archmage? Where the hell was she going to find one of those? But it was also something to focus on. A goal.\nAnd that was good. It was all good. Except that now Erin was back in the inn, she’d remembered something. Or someones. Rags and Pisces were gone. Well, obviously they’d both left once they realized she wasn’t getting back in time for dinner. And that was good too. Erin didn’t think she could face them right now.\nThe fish guts were all separated, and Erin had the teeth, bones, and miscellaneous bits ready for Toren to take out and dispose of. Far away. She’d have to tell him that. He could toss them back in the stream.\nShe stared down at the mostly descaled bits of fish. The blood and guts stared up at her. She could cook them, though. She could turn them into something useful. It was a valuable Skill, and one she’d gotten without even having to practice. It was practically like magic.\nErin’s fist hit the pile of fish guts.\n“Damnit.”\nShe hit the fish again. Bits of blood splattered her face, but Erin punched harder.\n“Dammit. Dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit,\ndammit.\n”\nShe punched the flayed fish, ignoring the\nsquishing\nand the splatters of blood. She kicked the counter, hit the fish until her hands were raw and tingling, and then stopped.\n“Fuck. Stupid,\nstupid\n—”\nThere were no right words. And all the ones she knew sounded so hollow and pitiful. Erin put her hands over her face and took them away instantly. Bits of fish clung to her skin. She looked around.\nThe counter and floor were even more of a mess than they’d been before. So were Erin’s clothes and her hair. She reeked of the smell of dead fish now. It would take a long time to clean up, even with Toren’s help\nIf she were a mage, she’d be able to clean it all up with a spell or a wave of her wand. If she were a mage, she’d be able to cook everything and relax without having to worry about a thing. If she were a mage, she might even learn how to bring herself back home.\nIf she could use magic…\nBut she couldn’t.\nA few tears ran down Erin’s face. She would have wiped at her eyes, but her hands were dirty. She was dirty. And she had no magic to make it all go away. She couldn’t even dream of magic. Because she had none. And knowing that made it all so much worse.\nHer tears fell onto the cutting board and mixed with the blood and death below her. Erin didn’t care. She let her tears fall and heard the sound of an owl’s wings flapping and heard the high pitched tones of a celeste, and far off in the distance, horns and violins.\nFor a moment, she wore robes and held a wand that sparked and glowed. In that instant, she could fly, albeit with a broom, and there was nothing that she couldn’t solve with a few latin words and a spell. For a moment.\nBut the magic was gone. And only Erin was left, covered in dead fish and lost.\nAlone, and dreaming of home.\n“…Damn it.”\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "After two hours of talking, the shouting began—and stopped almost as fast. Tempers had risen—and no sooner did a chair scrape back than they all caught each other and took a second to breathe.\nThe six people sat around a table and studied each other carefully. They were all warriors, and all but one of them was Human. And while some of them were friends with each other, they weren’t here to socialize. This was business, and right now, they were all arguing about one thing.\nThe first to break the silence was the Minotaur. Calruz, captain of the Horns of Hammerad, wasn’t one for waiting at the best of times, and his patience was already stretched thin. He hit the large table in the Adventurer’s Guild lightly—at least in the sense that his fist didn’t crack the wood. Two of the other adventurer captains jumped from the impact as everyone stared at him.\n“Have you no\nspines?\nHere is the opportunity of a lifetime, and you all hesitate to step forwards! Grab your axes, and let’s enter these ruins already!”\nThe woman sitting next to him shook her head. She was a fair-skinned woman with blonde hair and polished silver armor, completely contrasting against Calruz’s bare chest and impatient nature. But he and she were in agreement.\n“Most of us don’t use axes, Calruz. And while you have a point, recklessness is the exact reason everyone else is hesitating. We need to move carefully, and I’m saying it can be done. But—together. No running over people’s chances to speak.”\nThe Minotaur glared sideways at the woman, but he was wise enough not to attack his only ally in the room. He subsided back into his chair, grumbling.\n“If we don’t get in there first, some Gold-rank team is going to organize an expedition and grab everything before we do!”\nOne of the captains sitting across the table shook his head. He was an archer, at least from the large longbow resting against the table next to him.\nHe\nwas tired—not only from organizing this meeting, but from riding all the way here from Liscor to meet everyone. Without Skills to aid his travel, it had been a day-long ride with little breaks. Even so—he was cautious and moderated his arguments. Because he had seen what Calruz was speaking so eagerly about with his own eyes.\n“That’s what Charlez said. He took his entire group in right off, and they came back as\nzombies.\nNot a scratch on their weapons, but their armor was nearly ripped off. We all know what that means.”\n“I don’t. Stop talking in riddles and spell it out for me.”\nOne of the adventurer captains leaned forwards. He was a burly man with an axe nearly as large as Calruz’s strapped to his back. He glowered at the archer-captain.\nThis time, it was the man in robes sitting next to him that answered the captain. Captain Menes was a spellcaster, a decent one, but Silver-rank. Not Wistram-trained but bookish, like most [Mages].\n“What it means, Gregor, is that whatever Charlez and his group ran into, they didn’t even get a chance to fight back before it ripped them to pieces. And then\nsomething—\nit might have been another monster or the same one—reanimated them and sent them back out. That’s a serious threat.”\n“And above our ability.”\nThat came from a scarred man who only wore a longsword at his side. Captain Rois. He wasn’t armored like the other adventurer captains, but then, he clearly didn’t feel the need while they were sitting in an Adventurer’s Guild talking. He folded his arms and shook his head at Calruz and the only female captain, Yvlon.\n“We’ve all heard of how many Bronze-rank teams and individuals have been lost in those damned Ruins so far. True, most of them rushed in, but Charlez was different. He was experienced, and he went in prepared to retreat. Whatever got him was deadly. And you’re proposing we go in without knowing what the hell is down there?”\nThe woman in silver armor shook her head. She had the emblem of her noble house emblazoned on her armor, and so the others were slightly deferential—but only just. They were all adventurers, here.\n“Silver and steel, Rois, haven’t you been listening this entire time? I’m not saying go in blind! The exact opposite! I’m proposing we join together and launch a six-team raid on those ruins. We stock up on supplies, pool our best warriors, and fortify along the way as we go as far as we can.”\nShe glanced at Cervial, the [Archer Captain], for confirmation that she was on-track with his proposal and got a nod.\n“We’ll have a far better chance if we work together, and the Ruins are practically untouched beyond the first level. I hear Liscor doesn’t want to investigate themselves and is leaving everything up to the adventurers. If we want to get to whatever treasures are buried in there, now’s our chance.”\nCalruz nodded emphatically, but the others didn’t appear convinced. Cervial leaned forwards and addressed the table at large.\n“Why not let the other adventurers go in first and wait for at least one or two to come back for more insight? I know I organized us to talk—but I’m still not sold myself. This isn’t like you, Yvlon. I could see Calruz wanting to go in, but how’d he manage to talk you into it?”\nYvlon, the woman in silver armor, smiled at the other captain.\n“Impatience and daring, Cervial. I was excited as the rest of you when I heard about the ruins. But you’re right. I am moving fast, but not because Calruz managed to talk me into it. I heard there’s a team of Gold-rank adventurers who’ll be here in a week or less.”\nThat\ncaused a stir at the table. The other captains muttered, and not happily too.\n“Well\nthat\nchanges things.”\n“Does it? Not in my opinion. The Ruins are still too dangerous.”\n“But letting a bunch of Golds take all the treasure? That’s different. Are they bound from the City of Adventurers?”\n“Almost definitely. But that’s not all I’ve heard. And my news is more disturbing.”\nThis time, it was the Menes who spoke up. He glanced around the table and raised a finger significantly. The tip of it sparked with magic.\n“There’s a Named-rank adventurer in the city right now. You might have heard of her. Gazi the Omniscient.”\nAll the captains fell silent. Gregor’s lips moved soundlessly with awe and trepidation.\nGazi the—\nOf course they knew her. That—that changed things.\nGold-rank was as high as most ranking systems allowed for in any continent. As a general rule of thumb, a Bronze-rank adventuring team wasn’t much better than a group of rookies, while a Silver-rank team was more than a match for a small city’s standing militia. The equipment and magic available to a group of adventurers like the Horns of Hammerad meant that they could take on challenges even a large garrison might not manage.\nBeyond that, Gold-rank adventurers were experienced, highly-trained groups that could handle most monster threats with ease. At the top of that grouping, teams of adventurers were equivalent to small armies and could affect disputes between nations.\nSome countries quibbled about the exact definitions of each rank and had different ways of grading the ranks—but in practice, they were all able to fit in these three categories to a certain degree of expectation. But once you surpassed a certain level of prowess, you got given a new title.\nNamed-rank Adventurer.\nIn practice, they were called that because their names were known throughout the part of the world where they travelled. They were living legends to adventurers with short careers like the Silver-rank captains in the room. There was no higher rank, no loftier expectation. One of them could do what teams of Gold-ranks could not.\nThey were famous, like Deniusth the Violinist, Saliss of Lights—and Gazi was famous enough to be known continents away.\nCaptain Rois broke the silence first. He checked his longsword and exhaled hard.\n“Well, that’s different. Very different. If a Named adventurer is in the city, there’s probably only one real reason why she’s there: the ruins. But the real question is why hasn’t she gone in yet?”\nCaptain Menes lifted his hand.\n“I’ll tell you why. It’s because she’s being cautious. And if a\nNamed\nadventurer doesn’t want to go in just yet—”\nCervial hesitated.\n“She might not have any idea what’s down there. It could be fine. They’re not all-knowing. I mean, despite her name.”\nNo one laughed at the joke. Gregor licked his lips nervously. Gazi had spooked him.\n“Or there could be monsters that would make the High Passes look like a small bear cave by comparison! No! My group won’t take part.”\n“You coward, Gregor. Where’s your sense of pride as a warrior?”\nCalruz raised his voice and aimed it at the captain with the axe. The man flushed red and pushed his chair back angrily, but Menes put a hand on Gregor’s shoulder.\n“None of us are cowards, and you’d do well to remember that before tossing around insults, Calruz. But this changes things.”\n“Only if you’re taking the worst view of it.”\nThis came from Cervial. He was thinking, stroking the handle of his bow thoughtfully as he spoke.\n“I might,\nmight\nbe willing to give this a try. I’ve wasted enough time in Liscor to see that the other teams aren’t organized. Charlez was brave—but he went in alone, with only his team for backup. The Horns of Hammerad and the Silver Spears together represent a large fighting force. If I throw in my team, we’d have a party big enough to challenge even the deeper parts of the Ruins of Albez.”\n“Don’t be stupid, Cervial. You can’t expect these ruins to be the same.”\nCervial shook his head at Menes—the [Mage] was appalled, but the other captains were listening hard.\n“I’m not suggesting they are. But between our three teams, we’re at least equal to one or two Gold-rank teams, and if the rest of you joined in it might work. Might.”\nCalruz leaned forwards and addressed Cervial.\n“If you’re with us, I’ll want your full commitment, not uncertain promises. My team has heard my decision, and they are with us. If you lack their spirit, we do not need you.”\nYvlon winced, and Menes shook his head, pushing himself back from the table. Calruz was no negotiator. But Cervial didn’t seem to have taken much offense. He studied Calruz and then asked a question.\n“What does Ceria Springwalker think about the Ruins?”\nThat caused another pause in the room. All eyes turned to Calruz. The Minotaur’s nostrils flared, and he snorted angrily.\n“Ceria does not lead the Horns of Hammerad. I do.”\nCaptain Rois had paused, his chair scraping on the floorboards. He sat down thoughtfully, and Menes joined him. Rois looked at Calruz.\n“Yes, but she’s got more experience adventuring, and she’s older than any two of us in this room put together. If she thinks it’s worth the risk, I’ll throw in with this plan.”\nGregor the axe-captain stared incredulously from Calruz to Cervial. He stood up.\n“You’re all crazy, and whatever’s down there is going to eat you alive. I’m out, and so is my party.”\nYvlon shook her head, distraught. She glanced at the mage captain hopefully.\n“Menes? You with us? Listen. This is the kind of thing that puts a team on the map. My brother’s team, the Silver Swords? They didn’t become Gold-ranks turning down chances like this.”\nEveryone glanced up, because Yvlon had invoked a famous name. The Silver Swords.\nGold-ranks.\nMenes hesitated brushing at his robes and then shook his head reluctantly.\n“I’m sorry, but Gregor’s right. It’s too risky, and my group needs more space to cast our spells. If we knew for certain what was below, I’d join you. Cervial, you should think this through as well.”\nThe archer-captain paused and then shrugged.\n“I understand, but I’ll trust our resident half-Elf on this one. If she thinks it’s worth the risk, I’ll take my team in, cramped corridors or not. How often do you think we’ll get a chance like this?”\nHis words went unanswered. Gregor and Menes left the room, shaking their heads and talking to each other quietly. After a moment, the scarred captain stood up and followed after them, leaving the three captains behind.\n“Well, that could have gone better.”\nYvlon leaned over the table despondently as Calruz glared at the closed door.\n“We don’t need cowards. If they lack the courage to risk their lives, we were better off without them to begin with. Such weakness would only drag us down.”\n“Yes, but now we have to fill their holes with Bronze-rank teams, and that\nis\nweakness. I guess it’ll come down to how many freelancers are hanging around the ruins. We’ll need more mages and more front-line fighters. At least we’ve got one team who can detect and disarm traps.”\nCervial raised one hand warningly.\n“\nIf\n—”\n“Yes, if Ceria thinks it’s worthwhile. But I believe these Ruins might even be bigger than Albez, don’t you?”\n“Then why didn’t Ceria join us and lend her support while we were all arguing? If she had—”\nCalruz snorted.\n“Bah. She wanted to stay in Celum. Now she’s pacing around the Runner’s Guild.”\n“Why?”\n“She was waiting for a Runner to come back. She made a mistake and gave her mana potions instead of healing potions right before she ran into the High Passes.”\nThe two other captains blanched. Cervial shook his head sadly, but Calruz was unaffected.\n“I told her it would not matter. This Runner is no coward like the others. Mistake or not, she will survive the journey. And meanwhile, we have an expedition to prepare.”\n“You seem awfully confident about that, Calruz. The High Passes are no joke. If it were there we were going to explore, I wouldn’t feel comfortable even with all three of our teams working together.”\n“She will survive. She is a Human worthy of my admiration and respect. She will survive.”\nYvlon raised her eyebrows at Cervial. It was rare that anyone heard Calruz talking about any Human positively, let alone like this.\n“This wouldn’t happen to be that barefoot Runner I’ve heard so much about, would it? Was that the one who bailed your group out when you were fighting that Lich?”\n“The very same. Her name is Ryoka Griffin, and she is fearless.”\nCervial’s fingers snapped together lightly. The other two captains looked at him in surprise.\n“I wondered where I’d seen her face. That girl—I believe I saw her last night. She ran straight into the city just before dawn. She’s here now, in fact. I saw her entering the guild.”\nCalruz’s eyes widened. His mouth fell slightly open. The Minotaur’s long, tufted ears went very still. He blinked at Cervial and then turned his eyes upwards to the ceiling.\n“Ryoka Griffin is\nhere?\n”",

    "text": "It was odd. Ryoka was sure she hadn’t burned that many calories with her little light trick, but before she knew it, she’d downed a hunk of cheese, half a loaf of bread, and quite a bit of meat and an entire stick of butter.\nNot separately, of course; these came in the form of sandwiches, but it was still disgusting to think that she’d somehow eaten that much food in one sitting.\nCeria downplayed Ryoka’s disgust. She explained being ravenous was normal for someone casting magic for the first time and mages in general.\n“It’s why you don’t see many fat mages—well, at least among mages who actually use their spells in combat. You should meet one of the [Mages] in Wistram, Telim…anyways. After a really exhausting battle, I’ve eaten an entire ham by myself.”\nRyoka blinked at Ceria as the mage blushed. It didn’t even seem possible a ham would\nfit\ninside the half-Elf’s smaller body.\n“Aren’t your…people vegetarian?”\nInstantly, Ceria’s face turned wary.\n“Not all of us. I don’t know what you’ve heard, but we eat all the food Humans eat.”\n“Oh, of course. Sorry.”\nMentally, Ryoka kicked herself. She was\nreally\ntired to be making mistakes like that. But at least she hadn’t started talking about Tolkien elves or any of the other stereotypes. Come to that, she didn’t know much about half-Elves either. She wasn’t a big fantasy fan.\nChanging the subject, Ceria fiddled with her wand and pointed to Ryoka.\n“You should probably get your first level in the [Mage] class as soon as you take a nap. Hopefully, it’ll come with a Skill or a spell, but don’t worry if it doesn’t. After that, you can start thinking about what field of magic you want to specialize in.”\n“Oh. Levels.”\nAnother problem. Ryoka sighed.\n“Is—is leveling necessary to learn magic? Couldn’t I learn magic without gaining a…a class?”\nCeria looked surprised and had to think about that question for a moment.\n“Of course you don’t\nneed\nlevels to learn spells. I think? What a question. But it makes everything so much faster. For instance—when I reached Level 18 in my [Elementalist] class, I learned the spell [Fireball]. It would have taken me a month of study and the right scrolls to even begin casting that spell otherwise.”\nShe eyed Ryoka somewhat suspiciously.\n“Why? You aren’t one of those types who believes in the Book of Levels, do you?”\n“The what?”\nCeria waved her hands, grimacing.\n“Oh, this famous book that was popular when my grandmother was a child. I thought it died out, but I run into people who swear by it now and then. It has all kinds of notions about how levelling works. Some people—they claim that we all have a set amount of levels in us. If we gain too many levels in a bunch of different classes, we’ll eventually run out. The Book of Levels. Never heard of it?”\nGreat, religion without the gods.\nRyoka snorted derisively.\n“No. And I don’t believe in that either. I just wanted to know if I could study by myself or if I had to—to wait until I leveled to learn more spells.”\n“Oh. Well, that’s a common misconception. Mages level from casting spells, but we gain a lot of experience from studying magic. You can’t just go around throwing fireballs and expect to level up quickly.”\nAnd there was another thing. As Ryoka kept talking with Ceria, lightly speculating about what magic she might like to learn, her mind was racing.\nLevel limits?\nThat\nsounded like a game to her. But people were treating it like some kind of superstition. How much did they really know about levels anyways?\nIn Ryoka’s sleep-deprived state, parts of her mind were firing off with questions, but she deliberately did not ask Ceria any of them. She liked and even trusted the half-Elf, but some things were better left unasked. At least, for the moment.\n“You look beat. I’d offer you my bed, but all the other adventurers are waking up. They’ll be thumping around soon enough.”\nRyoka was pretty sure she could sleep underneath a railroad at the moment, but she still declined Ceria’s offer. Mostly because a railroad track might have less of a mess under it. Besides…she didn’t want to waste the moment.\n“I’d like to talk some more about magic and look around the Adventurer’s Guild if that’s okay.”\n“Of course. I’m free until Calruz finishes meeting with the other Silver-rank leaders. And besides, it’s breakfast and everyone should be downstairs. We can meet them and eat at the same time.”\nCeria didn’t notice the brief look of distaste that flicked across Ryoka’s face. The other girl didn’t want to go down and socialize, but she had no choice. Reluctantly, she followed Ceria down the stairs.",

Ceria’s fine, Garia’s fine…Sostrom is fine because he fixed my phone…\n…That’s about it. I’d be absolutely happy to talk to any one of them, but everyone else can go to hell rather than bother me.

It’s magic!\nMagic!\nI wonder what spells I can learn and—damnit, here come people.\nI follow Ceria down into the main section of the Adventurer’s Guild. The ground floor has an open lobby for people to either submit requests for assistance to the guild or adventurers to turn in bounties and collect rewards like the Runner’s Guild, but it also has more sections designed to cater to the adventuring lifestyle.\nA small shop staffed by employees of the city’s guild is the last stop in the small corridor before we reached what I can only describe as a cafeteria. It’s a mess hall, but the way it’s set up immediately screams school cafeteria to me. And this is not a pleasant association.\nThe cafeteria is essentially one far wall with a noisy kitchen partially exposed to the room and a long counter where adventurers can pay for food without having to make their way to an inn. The Adventurer’s Guild in Esthelm is even big enough to have quite a few rooms for rent like the one Ceria was staying in. I suppose it all makes sense—you can earn even more money feeding the people who kill monsters for you.\nAs soon as Ceria and I step into the room, people turn and look. I guess it’s an adventurer thing—and a Runner thing, come to think of it—not to want to be caught off-guard.\nBut the truth of it is that Ceria and I would probably attract attention anywhere we go. Ceria is Ceria—half immortal and beautiful. And I’m…me. I’ve got bare feet, and I’m taller than a lot of the guys here. Plus, I look Asian, and this is a very Anglo-Saxon type of place*.\n*Seriously. What’s up with that? Is it just a rule that white people are always the colonists who screw over the indigenous groups? I know Humans aren’t native to this continent, but does that also mean white—excuse me—\ncaucasian\n** groups are the dominant ethnic group in this world? Or…is it mirroring our world somehow? Hm.\n**Technically speaking, caucasian is also not politically correct since it implies someone who’s descended from the Caucasus region, which isn’t necessarily true. Plus, the word\nliterally means\nwhite people, just without saying the word white overtly. The correct term here would be European-American, except that it doesn’t apply to people here since there\nis\nno America or Europe, which means that\nwhite people is the best damn word there is and stop thinking about this—\n“Ryoka Griffin!”\nI’m cut off from my incoherent musings when I hear someone talking to me. It’s a familiar voice, but that doesn’t mean I’m too happy to hear it. Still, I’ve got to play nice. And I\ndo\nowe these people, even if it seems like half of them are a bit too interested in me as a member of the opposite sex.\nSo I smile, turn, and clasp hands with Gerial, Sostrom, and the other Horns of Hammerad as they get up from their seats. There are several people I don’t recognize, and they nod to me as Ceria and Gerial introduce them.\n‘Hey, Ryoka, this is blah blah or someone someone who’s here to hit things or shoot people with arrows.’ I really don’t care, especially since I’m still hungry, tired, and grumpy at having to meet people. But I do owe the Horns, so I shake hands and smile and pretend I like them, which is not my strong suit.\n…What’s wrong with me? Remember all that gratitude I was feeling—what,  a week ago? I remember it. I remember it—but the feeling’s gone.\nWhat’s left is this desire to kick something. It’s like I’m surrounded by Persuas, but these people have done nothing to harm me. Except Ceria, but the mana-potions thing was an accident, and she just taught me magic.\nBut suddenly I just—can’t. I can’t do the social thing. You know how it’s said introverts lose energy by being around people and extroverts gain it? I must be on zero battery because I feel like every second I spend around these people smiling at me I’m breathing bile.\nI have to get out of here—but because I like these fucking assholes, I’m staying put.\nI inhale, exhale—I hate them. I hate Garia, who punched out that asshole adventurer I should have kicked in the skull—I hate all of this.\nI just want to run. Run until I’m tired and away and…I try to shake off this feeling. It’s fine.\nI feel like this now and then. My parents can bring it out in about five seconds.\nEveryone has days like this, right?\nI’m just tired. It was a mistake to say I wanted to check out the Adventurer’s Guild to Ceria. What I really should have said is that I want to look around really quickly, talk with her for three more hours, and then go to sleep for the rest of the day before doing anything else.\nInstead, I’m stuck. And guess what? I forgot that people still hadn’t heard about me going through the High Passes, which means suddenly a bunch of annoying people want me to tell them exactly what happened.\n“I ran into a bunch of Goblins, some wolves, some goats, and then some gargoyles. I just kept running, and then I got to my destination.”\nGerial makes a polite sound of disbelief while Ceria eyes me as she brings us some more food. Cafeteria food for adventurers. Lovely.\nTo be fair, it’s sausage, barley bread, and some vegetable soup steaming in a bowl. And some weak, minty drink people around here love. And that’s great cooking by medieval standards. A far higher standard of living than what poor people would have eaten all the time*.\n*Barley. Barley bread, barley pizza, barley pancakes, barley soup…yeah. They didn’t have many options back then.\nI eat it while they pester me with questions. The Horns of Hammerad have their own table, but it seems like a bunch of adventurers just happen to be standing around listening too.\n“There’s got to be more than that. What kind of wolves were they? Normal kinds or were they actual monsters?”\nI glance up at Gerial. He’s still smiling and trying to be Mr. Nice Guy. Okay, maybe he genuinely is nice, but I still don’t like him as easily as I do Ceria. Probably because he’s a guy and even he can’t resist staring at my breasts once or twice*.\n*My eyes are up here. Not that I really want people to stare into my eyes. Over my shoulder is nice, but I’m used to them looking at my feet, too. And at least Gerial doesn’t stare much and stops when he realizes he is. That’s the sign of a semi-decent guy, as opposed to the other guy sitting next to him who can’t stop looking at them.\nOkay, I realize what the problem is. I uncross my arms and stop leaning back in my chair. If you’ve got it, don’t flaunt it unless you want people to think about touching it. Or something.\n“I don’t know. They were a lot bigger than normal wolves. And they had red fur.”\nAnd bodies like iron. Gerial looks around. One of the mages standing next to Sostrom nods.\n“Carn Wolves.”\n“Got to be.”\nSeveral of the nearby adventurers whistle, and Ceria looks pained. Oh yeah, she was\nreally\nguilty about giving me those mana potions by accident. I told her it all worked out, but—\n“They were pretty bad. They ate up the Goblins that ambushed me and then got torn to shreds by the Gargoyles and goats.”\nThe adventurers murmur again and look at each other. Gerial shakes his head and leans forwards, this time meeting my eyes.\n“See, Gargoyles I understand. They’re terrifying monsters when you find one holed up in a cave or terrorizing a village. But goats? What do you mean, ‘goats’?”\n“Probably the flesh-eating goats, the kind with sharp teeth that can tear even Carn Wolves apart. Eater Goats, they’re called.”\nThis comes from a guy standing among the other adventurers. He’s got a scar over one side of his face, and he’s wearing a longsword at his belt. Which means he’s pretty sparsely equipped compared to the rest of the adventurers, who’re walking around in chainmail or wearing leather armor even while they eat.\nHe nods at me as Gerial and the other Horns turn in their seats.\n“Rois, Silver-rank adventurer. You must be the famous barefoot Runner. Were those the kind of goats you saw?”\nI eye him. Despite the crowd now forming around our table, this guy is getting a bit of space and he’s not being shoved. Clearly, he’s important.\n“Yeah. I guess. They had sharp teeth. And they scream.”\nThe scarred guy nods grimly.\n“That’s them alright. Those goats hunt in packs and can climb anything. They’re village killing monsters. Whenever they leave the High Passes, they eat everything edible in their wake for miles around. If you outran them, Miss Runner, consider yourself lucky.”\nAll of the adventurers seem impressed at this. The scarred man seems to have fought the damned goats more than once, and Gerial and the others start asking him questions about them.\nI lean over to Ceria.\n“Who’s he?”\nShe pauses, swallows, and glances at the scarred guy who’s busy talking about how to behead the goats properly.\n“He’s Rois, captain of the Swordlock Dogs. A Silver-rank team, more known up north. He was supposed to be talking to Calruz and the others, but—”\n“Okay, okay. You got through the monsters, but what was waiting for you at the other end?”\nCeria breaks off as one of the newer members of the Horns of Hammerad interrupts our conversation. Rude asshole. He’s also the youngest guy with scruffy, brownish hair. He stares at me and demands to know who I met.\n“Who was he? Some rich hermit? A mage living in retirement? A shadowy figure?”\nLike hell I’m going to tell him or anyone for that matter. The mystery, possibly-elf archmage Teriarch might annoy me, but he’s my mystery.\n“No one special.”\nWhile I may not like people, I\nam\ngood at keeping a straight face while I tell lies*. And at least here I can play the Runner’s confidentiality card, so I don’t have to answer any more questions about him at least.\n*Lies like ‘oh, I’m\nso sorry\nyour stupid hamster died’, or ‘I just cannot\nbelieve\nyour stupid, inbred boyfriend dumped you! How terrible!’ And so on.\n“But Gargoyles? I’ve never seen one up close. What were they like?”\n“Big. Stone. They spit rocks and try to eat you.”\nWhat the hell do they want from me, a hand-drawn portrait with anatomical references? …Hell, I’d buy a monster bestiary if they had one around here. But all these adventurers want to know is how to kill one, and I’m definitely not the person to ask for that.\n“I barely got out alive. It was sheer luck that I got away.”\n“I happen to disagree with that. Anyone who can outrun a horde of Gargoyles is clearly not merely lucky.”\nThis time, the clear voice comes from behind the other adventurers. People turn and stand aside as they do as three adventurers walk forwards. That probably also has to do with one of them being Calruz. No one gets in his way.\nCalruz, a guy holding a huge longbow as tall as he is, and a woman in silvery armor walk to the table I’m sitting at. Great. More people, and these ones also look like captains. The woman with long flowing blonde hair smiles down at me and offers a gauntleted hand.\n“Yvlon Byres, Silver-rank adventurer. I’m Captain of the Silver Spears, and I wanted to make your acquaintance.”\nMy god does she look like something out of a movie. I stare up at her with crumbs on my face and then take her hand. One firm handshake later and somehow she and the other captains are sitting at the table.\nGreat. As if my trials weren’t enough. Now I’ve got Calruz sitting next to me, and a giant, hairy Minotaur is\nnot\nmy preferred seatmate. And now there are four Silver-rank adventuring captains sitting around me, nicely blocking me off from Ceria while a bunch of people stare at me like I’m some kind of amazingly interesting piece of crap*.\n*Or something else. Honestly, I could be a golden poodle for all I care. I\nhate\nbeing stared at when I’m not running, and even then it’s not exactly a blast. But at least then I can outrun the eyes.\n“Getting through the High Passes alive is something that hasn’t been done in years. Not that many Runners have tried it, but it takes a special kind of someone to do that.”\nCalruz snorted, and the other adventurers nodded as Yvlon, the fabulously armored and beautiful captain, continues lavishing praise on me. It’s actually getting to be more annoying than the questions.\n“It was a request. I got it done—half-done. I just need to finish my delivery, and it’ll be over.”\n“Really?”\nThis time, everyone is interested. One of the adventurers tries to look casual.\n“Where to? Whom to?”\n“Confidential.”\nTheir faces fall. But I don’t think any of them were really expecting to get the truth out of me anyways. But at the mention of the delivery, the ring and letter I’ve been given burn in my mind. I left them in the pack in Ceria’s room. Damn. I should have been more careful with them. I’ve got to deliver—\nI blink, unfocused for a second.\nThe spell.\nFor a moment, I was about to get up and start running. That stupid mage—\n“Ryoka?”\nI look up. Everyone’s staring at me. I must have not been paying attention. I try not to turn red, fail, and look at Yvlon.\n“Sorry, what?”\nThis\nis why I hate talking to people. But she smiles as if nothing happened and asks me again.\n“I was just wondering if you had any levels in a fighting class or whether you only had levels as a Runner. Did you enter into any other classes before this?”\nNow\nthat\nis a loaded question that I’m not prepared to answer. I scramble—give up.\n“Why do you want to know?”\nYeah, that’s right. I’m about as blunt as a hammer to the face. But Yvlon only smiles.\n“Simple curiosity. I’d like to see how well you’d do in a fight. I’m told you’re quite the pugilist despite being a Runner.”\nPugilist? Who the hell uses that term? Oh, right. ‘Boxer’ probably hasn’t been invented yet.\nGerial looks blank. He and the other adventurers at the table exchange a glance.\n“What’s a ‘pugilist’?”\nCeria sighed and supplied the answer.\n“Boxer.”\nAll the adventurers nod in sudden understanding. Okay, maybe boxing\ndoes\nexist in this world and Yvlon’s just a prat. Or someone who appreciates literature. I could respect that*.\n*But I won’t. I’m too tired. And pugilist is a stupid word, anyways.\n“Who’d you hear that from?”\nWord\ncan’t\nhave spread about me laying the beat down on that stupid adventurer in Celum. No way. I literally outran rumor. So how does this woman know who I am and that I can fight?\n“I heard it from my aunt twice-removed. She lets me know about interesting people, and she told me it would be worth seeking you out.”\nAll the adventurers seem to understand this and look at me curiously. But I’m still out of the loop.\n“Who’s the aunt? Do I know her?”\nCeria coughed gently, as if I’m making a stupid mistake.\n“Yvlon Byres is leader of the Silver Spears, but she’s also part of a noble family, Ryoka. House Byres. Up north. They deal in…silver I think?”\nI look blank. Ceria sighs.\n“The Byres family? Aristocracy?”\n“Minor aristocracy.”\nYvlon corrects Ceria with a smile.\n“We’re practically unheard of. My sister’s a [Merchant], and my brother’s a [Knight]. We have relatives, but it’s a small family. We trade in silver and have several large mines in the area. And we’re distantly related to the Reinharts.”\nShe says that as if it means something. The who…?\nOh. Ah, shit. Magnolia’s last name is Reinhart, isn’t it? That means—\nThat\nfucking woman.\nEven when I think I’ve outrun her she manages to find someone to bother me.\nFor a moment, my scowl flashes across my face, and Gerial closes his mouth and sits back. Yvlon eyes me, the smile still fixed on her face.",

    "text": "“I’m sorry if my aunt has bothered you, Ryoka, but she’s quite insistent. And she’s told all of my family—everyone, really, to keep an eye out for you.”\nGerial blinks at Yvlon. Not the quickest on the uptake, and nor are the other adventurers. But the archer-guy—Cervial I think his name was—and Ceria both stare intently at Yvlon. And so does Calruz. I guess he’s pretty quick too.\nBut if Ceria and Cervial say nothing, Calruz doesn’t have their subtlety. Or any, for that matter. He rests his arm on the table and leans forwards—which is only a little bit since he’s so massive already—to stare down at Yvlon.\n“Her business is her own. If Magnolia Reinhart seeks Ryoka Griffin, she should either respect her privacy or seek her outright.”\nYvlon makes a pretty face and shrugs ruefully at Calruz.\n“Sorry, Calruz, but no one in my family defies Lady Magnolia. And I wasn’t intending on doing anything to Ryoka. I just wanted to know if she really\nwas\ngood at fighting barehanded.”\n“And I suppose you are?”\nAgain, maybe she’s well known, but everyone gives me a look like I’m a massive idiot. Yvlon smiles.\n“I’ve got a bit of a reputation. The Silver Spears are known for fighting with any weapon that comes to hand and barehanded if need be.”\nSostrom nudges me on my right side and mutters loud enough for me to hear.\n“She once defeated five bandits with only her bare hands after losing her sword.”\nWow. Wooooow. And am I supposed to be impressed by that? Beating five guys down with your bare hands isn’t exactly amazing in my book. And it’s less amazing because Yvlon Byres is wearing full-plate armor made out of expensive metal. If she was fighting ‘barehanded’ with those metal gauntlets on against five guys with bad weapons, I’d put money on her too.\nPerhaps my lack of any amazement showed*, because Yvlon raised one perfect eyebrow, and the other adventurers looked—discontented. Why? Because I’m not impressed by a chump in armor smacking around a few idiots?\n*It totally did. I was not impressed.\n“I heard that you managed to defeat a low-level [Assassin] with your bare hands and fought a Carn Wolf without any weapons as well.”\nThis time,\neveryone\ngoes silent. Okay, that’s it. Magnolia has been upgraded from a person I really don’t want to talk to into someone I can’t ignore. The assassin is one thing since I bet she hired him, but—how did she know about the wolf?\n“I’d love to see your abilities myself. I know you’re tired, but if you have time for a quick match, I could give you a handicap.”\nThere’s no malice in Yvlon’s tone. In fact, she’s been pretty above-board with me about telling me she knows Magnolia and all. And it’s probably a fair offer, considering adventurer levels and all that. Certainly none of the other adventurers—Gerial, Sostrom, etcetera are frowning. Only Calruz looks displeased.\nBut—a handicap. A handicap for me from this woman who looks like a supermodel who got sent back in time? Or one of those Hollywood female knights?\nRight, that’s it. I’m tired, cranky, and I ran over sixty miles last night to get here after fighting a mysterious assassin, getting in a bar fight, and managing to cast magic for the first time in my life.\nFirst things first. I’m going to kick Yvlon’s face in, challenge Calruz to a fight, and then go to sleep.\nExactly in that order.\nThe potion bottle at my waist sloshes gently as I grin with all my teeth at Ms. Perfect Knight-Adventurer.\n“Why, I’d\nlove\nto have a sparring match. Tell me, have you ever heard the word MMA?”\nShe looks confused.\n“MMA?”\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "When Garia arrived in Esthelm just before midday, she saw the commotion outside the Adventurer’s Guild before she’d even dropped off her delivery.\nSugar. Several bags of it—enough for a huge rush order in one of the bakeries in town. The heavy, sticky delivery had messed up the inside of Garia’s pack. She’d have to spend quite some time cleaning it out with water and a ball of soap.\nThe thought was depressing to the girl, but she put that out of her mind the instant she saw Ryoka. As always, the other girl was at the center of some kind of attention. In this case, she was surrounded by a crowd of adventurers in the open courtyard used for training and sparring in the Adventurer’s Guild.\nShe wasn’t sparring or using a weapon. Yet. But Garia could see, as plain as her own level, that Ryoka was about to fight. The other girl had a—certain expression that crossed her face in times like these.\nExternally, she did seem like normal Ryoka. That was to say, her impassive face, which gave nothing away, and her distant, reserved eyes that had fascinated Garia the first day she’d met the other girl.\nBut in times like these, though the mask would not break, Garia could see another Ryoka peering out from behind. And her eyes—yes, you had to look there. Ryoka’s eyes held a faint, fierce light.\nNot a kind one. Certainly brave—wild enough for her to run into Albez and deliver healing potions for a team in need. But the same kind—\nThe same kind of madness that had sent her to the High Passes. Garia had wondered about it, and her conclusion was something Ryoka would hate to hear.\n…But it reminded Garia, a bit, of how Persua looked at her. Only, where Persua focused on Garia’s weight, upon anyone she didn’t like who slighted her—Ryoka’s was for the entire world. And it was brightest when it was in the mirror. It was in her gaze now as she squared off against the woman in silver armor. A blazing contempt for her own safety.\nIt made Garia hesitate, but she was even kinder than she was curious. That instinct prompted her to gently push her way through the crowd of adventurers to stop Ryoka from picking a fight with someone dangerous.",

    "text": "Ryoka was stretching her legs out, touching her toes when she saw someone lift up a guy in leather armor and shift him out of the way. Garia, red-faced and blushing, apologized and edged into the open space and towards Ryoka.\nHuh. But Ryoka had suggested Garia come to the city, hadn’t she? It was just…odd. Her conversation with Garia felt like it had happened a long time ago. But she’d been awake then and hadn’t slept since.\nTired. Which wasn’t good. Ryoka had to be at the top of her game for what was coming next.\nRyoka nodded as Garia cautiously walked closer. She would have smiled—or at least thought about smiling—but she didn’t feel like it. She needed to concentrate.\n“Hey.”\n“Um, hi, Ryoka. What’s up?”\n“Nothing much. See that person? The one in the silver armor? She challenged me to a fight.”\nRyoka nodded across the courtyard to where Yvlon was talking to Ceria, Calruz, and several other members of the Horns of Hammerad. Garia eyed her once, gulped, and then bent down to whisper to Ryoka.\n“Ryoka? Did you do something to make her—um,\nmad?\n”\nRyoka bared her teeth. It might have been a smile.\n“I don’t think so. Not yet, anyways. She challenged me to a ‘friendly’ match. I accepted. Why?”\nGaria’s lips moved. The City Runner turned her head, and her eyes focused on the other woman. Her voice was too-casual as she turned back to Ryoka.\n“Oh. Nothing. It’s just—that’s\nYvlon Byres\n, Captain of the Silver Spears. She’s famous around here.”\n“So I’m told.”\n“And she challenged you. To a fight?”\n“Well, a sparring match. I was the one who wanted to turn it into a fight.”\n“\nWhy?\n”\nRyoka hesitated. She eyed Yvlon across the open space between them. The other young woman—she was closer to Ryoka’s age, possibly a year or two older—was smiling and addressing a worried-looking Ceria. She turned, met Ryoka’s eyes, and nodded politely.\nThe barefoot girl looked away. She began stretching her other leg and muttered to Garia.\n“I—just want to push her face in a bit, don’t you? She’s a bit too beautiful and perfect.”\nGaria waited, but Ryoka just stood back up and began touching her toes, breathing slowly and steadily.\n“That’s it?”\n“Yup.”\n“Ryoka, that’s—I know Yvlon. Her group, the Silver Spears, helped chase off a group of bandits that was attacking me once. And I’ve heard of her. She’s a really good person! She’s nice, she gives to the poor, her team takes on requests to help people even if the reward isn’t high—”\n“I get it. She’s a great person. A\npopular girl.\nSomeone everyone likes.”\nThe expression on Ryoka’s face said that she didn’t share the same opinion. Her eyes were flinty as they flicked towards Yvlon.\n“You don’t think she’s like that?”\n“Maybe. Maybe not. She just—reminds me of people I don’t like. And she looks too nice for an adventurer. I don’t like nice people. They’re always hiding something. It’s always a mask, right? Like Fals.”\nThere was so much to unpack that Garia was left dumbfounded. She looked at Yvlon, then Ryoka.\n“That doesn’t make any sense. Fals is—he has his faults, but he’s not a bad person. There’re good folk out there. Like—like the Horns.”\nShe waited for some of that reasonableness to drip into Ryoka’s ears, but the City Runner just shook her head.\n“I guess. Maybe. Shame we won’t ever find out the truth. Alright, I’m ready.”\nRyoka finished stretching out her hamstrings and stood straight, sighing. Her conversation with Garia was—distracting. She didn’t really have a good explanation for Garia, not one she could articulate. It was just how she felt. More than anything, Ryoka had been happy to fight Yvlon.\nThe other adventurer noticed she was staring and smiled again. Ryoka scowled. That\nsmile\n. That polite, little smile. It said quite clearly Yvlon knew Ryoka was spoiling for a fight—and that Yvlon would win either way. She wanted to wipe it off Yvlon’s face. Ryoka muttered to the side.\n“She looks way too attractive, that’s all.”\nGaria shook her head. She seemed to wrestle with herself and then burst out.\n“You\nboth\nlook like—like princesses!”\nRyoka blinked at the other Runner. Garia stared back, embarrassed.\n“You do. You both look—way better than I do. Or Persua. Or anyone, really. I don’t see why you want to fight her.”\n“She wants to test me, too. She’s working for Magnolia.”\n“She’s\nrelated\nto Lady Magnolia, Ryoka.”\n“Hrm.”\n“You know she once took on five men and won, right? She did it\nbarehanded\n.”\n“With armor though, right? Not exactly barehanded. You try punching out someone in plate armor. I bet those [Bandits] could have taken her on without the armor. I can—even if she’s got it on.”\nGaria was close to tearing out her hair. She clutched at her head and regretted it as her sugar-encrusted palms mixed with her sweat.\n“It was still\nfive people\n, Ryoka! Most adventurers couldn’t do that with a weapon!”\nRyoka knew that was true. She knew it was…probably…impressive, but even in her own head, she didn’t want to give the thought too much credence. Garia was still talking. Ryoka debated tuning her out and reluctantly listened.\n“I know she won’t hurt you—not if you don’t try to hurt her. But Silver-rank adventurers aren’t like that guy you fought in the tavern, Ryoka. If you make her get serious, she’ll—what are you doing?”\n“Warming up.”\nThe barefoot girl wasn’t done with her pre-fight stretching. From stretching her legs, she’d moved onto her arms. And while the adventurers had watched her touch her toes and stretch her legs with interest, the next phase of her warm up was…different.\nRyoka shook her arms out in a fanning motion. It looked ridiculous, she knew. Sort of like a kid pretending to be a chicken. But it was a necessary stretch if she wanted to throw hooks when she was fighting. She began to circle her arms around, first in one direction and then the other.\nAdventurers were laughing. Ryoka ignored them. She raised her arm and grabbed the elbow, gently pushing it down her back. Then she repeated it with her other arm.\nAll in all, the stretches took five minutes. Ryoka did everything from touching her toes to stretching out her legs to rotating her hips as if she was using a hula-hoop in slow motion.\nWhen it was done, Ryoka could feel every part of her body was ready to go. She also had an audience. Besides the adventurers already watching her and Yvlon, a group of enterprising street vendors had joined the crowd along with a sizable group of pedestrians. They were already betting as they stood in the circle, chatting, eating food, and laughing at Ryoka’s antics.\nYvlon smiled as Ryoka walked into the center of the ring. She nodded to Ceria and took a few steps towards Ryoka.\n“Interesting. You’re quite limber. Was that supposed to help you fight?”\n“You don’t stretch before a fight?”\nThe other adventurers laughed or chuckled. Yvlon shook her head and replied drily.\n“Not like that. I don’t think any warriors I know would do that—especially not in front of an audience.”\n“Shame. One more advantage for me, then.”\nIt was amazing, Garia reflected as she watched Ryoka, that the other girl was completely—and always, come to think of it—confident. Even when she was facing down an adventurer in armor. At least, in a fight. She squirmed more when she was just talking to the [Receptionists] at the Runner’s Guild. But right now…Yvlon turned to the side where the Horns of Hammerad were standing.\n“Pardon me. I was just reassuring your friends that this friendly exhibition would not be harmful to you. If you’ll allow me a minute, I’ll remove my armor.”\nSo saying, Yvlon began removing her gauntlets, but Ryoka shook her head.\n“You can leave your armor on. The gauntlets too.”\nThe crowd had been talking and joking as they waited for the sparring match to begin, but Ryoka’s words created a hush as if someone had cast a [Silence] spell. Yvlon raised her eyebrows, and behind her, Ceria slapped her forehead.\n“I wouldn’t want to hurt you.”\n“It won’t be me that gets hurt.”\n“Ryoka, don’t be an idiot!”\nCeria walked forwards and snapped at the barefoot runner. She lowered her voice so not everyone could hear her, but in the silence, her words were perfectly audible to those around her.\n“Are you\ninsane?\nYou can’t fight someone in armor! Yvlon is a Silver-rank captain. Even if she pulls her punches, she’ll hurt you. This is just a sparring match—neither of you are supposed to get hurt.”\n“Really? Then let’s make it a serious fight.”\nCeria groaned as Calruz grinned in approval. The Minotaur watched Ryoka approvingly, liking her bravado. Ceria did not. She hissed at Ryoka so only the Runner could hear.\n“Yvlon is\nnot\nsomeone to take lightly, Ryoka. She’s honorable, proud—even if she is being patient. Stop being so rude.”\n“I’m taking her seriously, believe me. But I want to see what fighting someone in armor is like. And besides…you’ve never seen me fight, have you?”\nCeria blinked at Ryoka. She eyed her from top to toe.\n“No—but—”\n“Trust me.”\n“If Miss Ryoka Griffin says she’s confident, I will trust her word, Ceria.”\nYvlon smiled at the half-Elf, meeting Ceria’s worried stare. An unspoken message passed between the two, and Ceria’s pointed ears lowered slightly before she stepped back.\nNow, Ryoka and Yvlon were alone in the center of the ring. Ryoka bounced on the balls of her feet, eying Yvlon as the other woman divested herself of her belt pouches and sword.\n“I am afraid Ceria is right though, Ryoka. I would hate for you to break your hands on my armor or for me to cut your face with my gauntlets. I am sure I would be able to give you a fair fight even without my armor.”\n“It’s fine. You’re not wearing a helmet anyways.”\nAgain, Ryoka’s words caused a stir in the crowd, and not an entirely positive one. From her position, Garia could see some of the other adventurers—especially the armored women who were part of the Silver Spears—looking annoyed or outright angry at Ryoka’s words.\nBut Yvlon only smiled politely. It was a smile quite similar to Lady Magnolia’s, actually. A [Lady]’s smile that gave nothing away.\n“Very well. I am told you practice some sort of unarmed fighting? You said it was…MMA? I confess that I have only a bit of formal training myself. Much of what I know is self-taught.”\n“Yeah. I practice Mixed Martial Arts. Muay Thai.”\n“And you are a skilled practitioner of this…Muay Thai?”\n“Where I come from, yeah.”\n“Interesting. Then shall we begin? I believe it would be only courteous to allow you the first strike.”\nYvlon walked forwards a few steps and then raised her gauntleted arms in something close to a boxer’s guard. The murmuring of the crowd increased as Ryoka began circling the other woman, hands up.\nHer posture was different than it would be in a Muay Thai sparring match. Ryoka was treating this like an MMA fight, although she’d never been in one herself. But she’d practiced on the off-chance her parents would allow her to fight in the ring.\nHer posture and center of balance were lowered, her stance was wider, and her hands were loosely clasped into fists. She rested more weight on her front leg as she eyed Yvlon.\nNow that she was finally in front of the other woman, Ryoka found time for a shred of regret that she was fighting the other woman in armor. It was complete idiocy to fight anyone in armor barehanded. She knew that.\nBut part of Ryoka\nwanted\nthis. She wanted the challenge; she wanted to see how far she could push herself against unfair odds like this. And most of all, she wanted to\nwin\neven with Yvlon in full plate armor. She wanted it quite badly, in fact.\nThe other woman slowly rotated to follow Ryoka as the barefoot girl circled her. She was waiting for Ryoka’s first move, as she’d said.\nWell, that was fine with her. Ryoka feinted with her hands. Yvlon’s instinctively moved to block. Ryoka put all her weight onto her front leg and spun, throwing her back leg up and back towards the side of Yvlon’s head in what was known as a spinning wheel kick.\nRyoka’s leg flashed upwards, and Yvlon barely raised her arms in time to protect her head. Despite the armor she wore, she still staggered back from the impact.\nThat was the moment Ryoka had really been waiting for. Even before she was fully back upright, she moved sideways and threw a punch at Yvlon’s head.\nHer hands were impossibly quick. Garia couldn’t even see Ryoka as the girl threw a lightning-fast jab at the adventurer’s face.\nRyoka’s right hand flew forwards in a strike that would have caught Yvlon straight on the tip of her chin. But before it landed, one silver-plated hand came up and seized Ryoka’s hand.\nFrom her position, Garia saw the barefoot girl’s eyes widen, and then she twisted both body and head to avoid Yvlon’s fist. She couldn’t get away perfectly, held as she was by the other adventurer. The gauntlet caught Ryoka on the side of the jaw and drew blood.\nThe adventurers in the crowd cheered as Yvlon released Ryoka’s hand. That was probably a wise move regardless, because the look in the other girl’s eyes was pure fury. Ryoka muttered an expletive around her bleeding mouth and spat.\nYvlon gave Ryoka a polite smile as she raised her fists again. The light glinted off the polished metal and specks of blood on her right gauntlet.\n“I understand your pride, Ryoka Griffin, but we adventurers have our own dignity. You underestimate us at your peril. Are you sure you wouldn’t like me to remove my armor?”\nThat was the wrong thing to say. Ceria shouted something at Ryoka, but Garia saw the look in the Runner’s eyes. Slowly, she straightened, wiping the rest of the blood away from her cut lips.\n“I’m going to get serious now.”\nYvlon seemed to sigh, but in an instant, her guard was back up, and she was watching Ryoka warily. She didn’t underestimate the other girl despite having scored a point first.\nRyoka paused for a moment, staring hard at Yvlon. Then she advanced slowly, raising her hands above her head.\nThe adventurers in Esthelm were nothing if not admiring of someone with spirit. Half of them egged Ryoka on, laughing and cheering as she advanced on Yvlon while the other half bet whether she’d even manage to strike the other woman’s face.\nYvlon’s eyes narrowed as Ryoka got closer and closer. Before the other girl could move, she stepped forwards and threw a lightning-quick punch at Ryoka’s head.\nRyoka didn’t dodge so much as\nlean\non one leg and move her head down. The metal fist missed her head by inches, prompting a gasp from her audience. But neither woman was finished.\nEven as Ryoka dodged her first punch, Yvlon’s second hand flew up in an uppercut towards Ryoka’s face. But again, Ryoka took a step back and avoided the blow with mere inches to spare. Then she threw a backhand at Yvlon’s face.\nAgain, the adventurer blocked, but this time, Ryoka wasn’t interested in kicking. She darted behind Yvlon as the adventurer turned in her heavier armor. Ryoka hooked her leg behind Yvlon’s and kicked straight through, sending the armored adventurer tumbling to the ground.\nThe crash of metal was the only sound in the silence. Yvlon rolled and got to her feet in an instant, ready for an attack, but Ryoka just stood with her guard up, waiting.\n“Well.”\nWas it a rueful smile? It flicked across Yvlon’s face in an instant before she went all-out on the attack. She rushed at Ryoka, throwing swift punches that made the other girl dodge back.\nIt still wasn’t an equal fight. Even Garia could see that Ryoka was mostly on the defensive, unable to hit Yvlon while the other adventurer guarded her face. It wasn’t an equal fight.\nBut it was silent. Now, all the adventurers were watching Ryoka like hawks. She dodged back, letting Yvlon come at her, always moving, darting in for strikes against Yvlon’s head before escaping.\nRyoka missed the timing for one of her strikes, and Yvlon caught her in a flurry of blows. Ryoka took a punch to the midsection and a glancing blow off one shoulder—and then kicked Yvlon in the stomach hard enough to send the adventurer staggering back.",

    "text": "Again, Ryoka charged Yvlon. She avoided a wild punch and then had the other woman’s back. She stepped\nbehind\nYvlon with one leg and, using her elbow, threw the woman back over her knee. Again, the crash of metal was the only sound in the silence.\nThis time, Ryoka didn’t let Yvlon get up. She advanced on the adventurer as she struggled to get off the ground. Yvlon turned and lashed out with her fist, almost too fast for Garia to follow. But Ryoka had been expecting that. She leaned back and then seized the other woman’s arm.\nGaria saw Yvlon strike upwards at Ryoka, a flash of movement as the other girl twisted around her—for a second, all was confusion, and then Ryoka was twisting Yvlon’s arm up while she planted her knee on her back.\nIt was over. Ryoka was holding the arm as high as the armor would allow. She was about to transition into a choke hold when she saw Yvlon’s hand push against the ground—\nRyoka was thrown off by the explosive force as Yvlon threw herself back, knocking the other girl off her. She turned and\nkicked\n, and Ryoka tumbled with the force of the blow.\nYvlon was trying to rotate her arm and work out the pain when she saw Ryoka roll and tumble upright in a flash of motion. She blinked—and caught a fist to her face for the first time. Ryoka’s hand knocked her head back slightly. As Yvlon was stunned, two more lightning-fast jabs hit her on the cheek and jaw.\nThe fourth punch Yvlon caught in a grip like steel. Ryoka braced herself, but no metal fist came swinging her way.\nThe Captain of the Silver Spears was shaking her head, and her mouth was moving. Over the roar of blood in Ryoka’s ears, she realized people were shouting, and the adventurer released her hand and relaxed her stance as she massaged her mouth.\nThe fight was over.",

    "text": "“What was\nthat?\n”\nThat was the first question Garia asked Ryoka once she had a chance. This was mainly because everyone else was queuing up for food in the Guild’s mess hall.\nRyoka shrugged and pushed at her food with a sour face. It wasn’t that she wasn’t hungry—she was ravenous—but she was already tired of answering questions.\nReluctantly, she bit into a bit of juicy sausage and replied to the awestruck girl sitting across from her.\n“Those were throws. Special moves to take down an opponent. Haven’t you ever seen someone tossing an opponent to the ground before?”\n“Well, yeah, of course, but…”\nGaria floundered as she searched for words.\n“You made it look so\neasy\n. Yvlon was in armor, and you just threw her to the ground—twice!”\n“It would have been better if I’d kept her down.”\nRyoka grunted as she chomped hard on her food. At least she was able to savor it. A healing potion had taken care of all her injuries—and Yvlon’s.\nGaria stared at her incredulously.\n“You knocked down a Silver-rank Captain. Anyone would be proud of that.”\nRyoka smiled.\n“Yeah. And I got to hit her.”\n“Those last two punches were unnecessary.”\nCeria’s voice made the two Runners look up. The half-Elf slid onto the long table and frowned at Ryoka.\n“You didn’t need to hit her that many times. This was\nsupposed\nto be a gentle spar, not you trying to break her jaw.”\nRyoka looked completely unapologetic.\n“Oops.”\nCeria made a noise that sounded like a sigh crossed with a hiss and muttered darky under her breath. Ceria Springwalker was angry enough that she looked ready to shoot sparks from her eyes—until she grew abruptly calm.\nShe rose and, without a word, stepped back. Ryoka waited, but Ceria just walked away. The Runner looked almost disappointed. She was ravenous—and still shaking with adrenaline from the fight.\nTaking a seat across from Ryoka, Garia stabbed at her food. Thus far, she and Garia were the only two people to have joined Ryoka in the mess hall, despite the numerous adventurers sitting around them.\nPredictably, Ryoka had chosen the far corner of the furthest table from the door, which meant that there would be far fewer people able to talk to her. But it seemed as though quite a few adventurers would have liked to come up and chat; only a few did.\nThese were the members of the Horns of Hammerad and the various Silver-rank captains Ryoka had met. Two of them, the man named Cervial with the longbow and Yvlon, took seats next to Ryoka.\nMaybe it wasn’t intentional, but Cervial took the seat directly next to Ryoka, putting himself between the two women. It wasn’t as if either woman were overtly hostile to the other—and indeed, they were quite polite.\nBut if Yvlon was polite and genuinely admiring of Ryoka after the fight, there was a certain edge in Ryoka’s replies and comments that didn’t pass unnoticed at the table.\nYvlon politely munched on a boiled piece of asparagus or asparagus-like vegetable and commented to the table at large, but Ryoka and Garia specifically.\n“You see, it’s not as if we’re hurting for money or jobs at the moment. There’s always work, and we can brave the Ruins of Albez for quite a profit most of the time. But it’s not sustainable in the long run.”\nCervial nodded. He stabbed at his food and made a face.\n“Adventuring isn’t easy at our level. We’re just good enough that it’s not worth our time to take requests clearing out Goblin tribes unless they’re really big—but we don’t have the strength to take on the stronger types of monsters. Sooner or later, our luck runs out and we take an injury we can’t heal up from—or die. That’s why these new ruins might be our break. If we can get in there and find some serious magical artifacts or equipment, we could easily reach Gold-rank.”\n“The only question is whether the risks in this case are worth the reward. So far, Cervial’s team—the Flawless Flights—mine, and Calruz’s are the only ones who are willing to go in first.”\n“It took some doing, but Ceria convinced me that the ruins could be loaded with ancient artifacts. They’re quite similar to ancient crypts apparently.”\nCervial drained his mug and nodded politely at the others.\n“Still, we’re going in carefully. Both Yvlon and I are only doing this for the treasure.”\nRyoka shifted. She looked across the room at where adventurers were still being served. Perhaps it was because of his size, but Calruz had been stuck at the back of the line, and he was grumpy about waiting. He kept casting glances at the now-full table Ryoka was sitting at, irritated.\n“What about Calruz, then?”\nYvlon chuckled politely, and Cervial shook his head.\n“He just wants the challenge. That stupid Minotaur doesn’t care what enemies he’s fighting so long as he can gain experience from it. He’s an old-fashioned type. Death or glory with no in between. Not like the rest of us.”\nRyoka nodded. She thought she understood from context alone. If Yvlon and Cervial were adventurers who relied upon magical equipment along with their levels to get stronger, Calruz was the kind of person who thought gaining more levels was all that he needed. She looked at Cervial.\n“What’s the level difference between a Silver-ranked adventurer and a Gold-rank?”\n“The difference? Well—it could be just a few levels depending on their equipment. Remember, in most cases it’s the entire party who gets the Gold-rank. I guess Silver-rank is mostly in the low twenties at best while Gold-rank is anywhere from Level 24 onwards.”\n“Of course, individual skill still plays a pretty big role.”\nYvlon nodded at Calruz as the Minotaur impatiently waited for his food, clearly unhappy at missing the conversation and having to wait behind lesser adventurers.\n“Calruz isn’t 30, but he’s damn close. He’s also a Minotaur. He could have found his way onto a Gold-rank team, but he wanted to be in command.”\nAt last, the talked-of Minotaur was served a double portion onto his plate. He stomped towards the table, pausing when he saw there was nowhere to sit.\nHe took two steps towards Ryoka and pointed to Garia. The girl flinched as Calruz growled at her.\n“You. Runner. Move.”\n“O-oh. Sure.”\nGaria was about to slip out of her seat, but Ryoka and—surprisingly—Cervial grabbed her by the clothing.\n“Hold it, Calruz. You can’t just order someone to leave. Pull up a chair or sit at the other end of the table.”\nCalruz scowled down at Cervial.\n“She is no warrior. This place is reserved for adventurers, not mere Runners.”\nRyoka raised her eyebrows. Apparently, she didn’t count. Garia squeaked and trembled by her side.\n“I—I can go. It’s no problem. I didn’t want to get in the way—”\nThe standoff between them ended when someone booted Calruz in the butt as hard as she could. He actually noticed the move, but the half-Elf kicked him despite it. Calruz whirled—and she snapped at him.\n“You stubborn idiot. Let Garia sit. For a Minotaur who talks about honor, you certainly don’t have much when it comes to non-warriors.”\nRyoka lowered the plate she had ready to toss, and Cervial stopped leaning back.\n“I’m defending the integrity of—”\n“Oh shut up, Calruz. Is it honorable to bully someone who runs deliveries for people like us? Is that what a proud member of the House of Minos’ Beriad does? Sit down.”\nThat comment caused a hush among the nearby adventurers, and especially the rest of the Horns of Hammerad, but Calruz looked unmoved. He sat at the table, ignoring Garia like a footstool.\n“Honor is for those who earn it. I don’t know this Runner’s character.”\nRyoka frowned, but made no comment as Garia instantly went back to her food, avoiding looking at Calruz. There was a lot she\nwanted\nto say, but flipping the Minotaur’s food into his face was more appealing.\nBut since she had the feeling Garia might carry at least some of the Minotaur’s ire if she did it, Ryoka—reluctantly—held back. But the Minotaur’s attitude annoyed her.\nStill—now that Ryoka thought about it, she’d never heard Calruz say anything of substance to the other girl. He’d talked and she’d talked when they were in the inn, but the two had never directly spoken to each other that much.\nAs Ryoka’s eyes flicked towards Calruz and her expressionless face darkened slightly, Yvlon nudged Cervial. The taller man looked at Ryoka and spoke lightly.\n“Your skill at unarmed fighting is quite incredible. I can see how it would be useful keeping away bandits and Goblins.”\n“Mm?”\nRyoka looked up, realized she’d been addressed, and shrugged.\n“It helps.”\n“You wouldn’t happen to be able to use any other weapons besides your fists, would you? A bow, for example?”\nAcross the table, Gerial objected.\n“Wait a second, Cervial, if you’re going to recruit Ryoka, the Horns of Hammerad have the right to make the first offer.”\nSostrom and the other adventurers agreed while the adventurers that were part of the Flawless Flights shouted from their table across the hall. Cervial laughed and raised his hands and then looked at Ryoka.\n“I don’t use weapons. And I’m not interested.”\n“A shame. But I hope if you see a request from us you’ll consider taking it. In fact, if you’d like, we could arrange to request deliveries from you alone if you’re ever in the same area as we are.”\nThat\ngot Ryoka’s attention. What Cervial was suggesting was a form of personalized contract in the Runner’s Guild. That way, he could offer her exclusive deliveries.\n“Why? Any Runner can deliver healing potions.”\n“But no one has the guts to do it when there’s a Lich raining spells down on our heads.”\nThat remark came from Sostrom, and it was met with agreement from the other adventurers. Cervial nodded.\n“Being an adventurer is all about finding trustworthy contacts. Good Runners like you for instance—having someone to rely on when we’re out exploring dungeons is far better than requesting an emergency delivery and hoping the Runner we get is competent.”\nHe shrugged.\n“Not that we ever plan to get in trouble of course, but when we’re in a pinch…at our level, we need to forge friendships and build up our group. It’s not something people think about, but there’s really no other way to survive. We trust each other with our backs or we’ll fall together.”\nSomething about that line tickled Ryoka’s memory. She grunted and then looked at Cervial. The words came out before she could stop them. The same anger and contempt leaping from her thoughts out her mouth.\n“You sound like a bunch of Runners when you say it like that.”\nThe mood at the table froze over for a second. Garia stared wide-eyed at Ryoka and then tried to edge back in her seat. Cervial’s smile flickered and then came back.\n“Really? That’s not a good thing, usually. The Runner’s Guild and the Adventurer’s Guild don’t get along. They think we’re all muscle-bound idiots, and we think they’re—”\n“Cowards.”\nCalruz grunted and ate half a sausage in one huge bite.\n“I wouldn’t say\ncowards.\n”\nYvlon objected, but most of the other adventurers seemed to agree with Calruz. Yvlon sighed and smiled at Garia reassuringly.\n“Not all of you. It’s just that it’s an unfortunate comparison to make, Ryoka.”\n“Seems accurate to me.”\nRyoka deliberately popped the last bit of sausage into her mouth and took a drink, conscious of all the eyes on her. Cervial was still smiling, but it was a brittle smile.\n“Really? And which Runners do we sound like?”\n“Guy named Fals. He says the same things as you do. Runners have to band together in order to survive. Sacrifice the good of the individual for the group. ‘Work together or die.’”\nThoughtfully, Cervial propped his head on his hand. He was still smiling, but there was a tiny bit of anger in his eyes. Ryoka recognized it as something similar to her own. She felt…prickly. More so even than usual.\n“I can agree with that. And I know Fals. He’s no coward, although he does represent most of the things I dislike about the Runner’s Guild. But he’s not wrong. It’s a tough world. Yet you seem to disagree?”\nRyoka let the question dangle. She drained her mug, replenishing lost sweat. She wiped her mouth and shrugged.\n“I’m not a team player.”\nHer comment ended the conversation. There wasn’t really much that you could say to that. Garia slurped at her soup nervously and tried not to meet anyone’s eyes. Yvlon leaned across the table and smiled at Ryoka.\n“Well, in any case, if you’d like to work for any of our teams, we’d be happy to set up an arrangement. With your skills, we wouldn’t have to worry about you being chased off by monsters. In fact, if you’d like to join our expedition to the ruins around Liscor to deliver supplies, we could work out a deal.”\nCalruz shook his head at Yvlon. Ceria hadn’t sat down yet, but she drew Cervial aside as he got up. She prodded Calruz in the back of the head—he ignored it. She nodded to Yvlon, and the armored woman rose with a questioning look. Ryoka was in the midst of talking to Calruz as Yvlon, Cervial, and Ceria stepped back for a private word by the bar.",

    "text": "“Ceria, what did you want to say?”\nCervial was polite to her. Even if he was a captain of another team, the Flawless Flights, he knew she was, well, a half-Elf.\nOlder. Not that she’d lived amongst other folk than half-Elves for most of her life, but it carried weight. The half-Elf [Cryomancer] smiled apologetically as she motioned him and Yvlon aside.\n“Nothing much, Cervial. I just wanted to apologize for Ryoka’s conduct. You too, Yvlon.”\n“She’s better at fighting than I thought. I did agree to challenge her.”\nThe captain of the Silver Spears sounded too politely neutral to fool either Ceria or Cervial. The half-Elf grimaced.\n“I know she’s making a bad impression. I think she’s—rattled from the High Passes.”\n“Rattled?”\n“She ran in this morning, after running from just outside of Celum all the way here. Nonstop. She nearly got killed by the monsters, and I think—she’s a great Runner. Saved our lives.”\n“I can see why, with her moves.”\nAgain, Yvlon sounded too matter-of-fact, but she was softening a bit as Ceria laid out what she knew. The half-Elf nodded, one eye on Ryoka.\n“I think…it would be best to have given her some room. That idiot Calruz is crowding her up. And you know Magnolia Reinhart was doing something with her.”\nNow, Yvlon did hesitate, and the woman gave Ceria an apologetic nod.\n“My aunt is insistent. When you put it like that—”\n“Does that mean she hasn’t slept for at least a day? And then she ran over here and picked a fight with a Silver-rank Captain? She’s got the attitude of a Gold-ranker.”\n“Ego, too. But give her a bit. She’s rough—but who isn’t? Besides, she had her legs smashed with a wagon two weeks ago.”\n“She\nwhat?\n”\nCeria exhaled in relief. She began regaling both team captains with the story, and by the time she was done, both were giving Ryoka much friendlier looks.\n“When you put it like that, I imagine I’d be biting mad at everyone. Thanks for letting us know, Ceria. No wonder Calruz and Gerial speak so highly of you.”\n“Just interjecting some common sense.”\nThe half-Elf waved it away. By now, Gerial had come by, and he was nodding respectfully.\n“Maybe we let Ryoka cool off? Gerial, why are you here? I told you to grab Calruz. If he makes a joke about her breasts—”\nCeria frowned at Gerial, but the man lifted an apologetic hand.\n“He shoved me off. He and Ryoka were just talking punches and kicks. He’s good at it, you know.”\nCeria craned her neck over his shoulder, suddenly alarmed. She punched Gerial in the arm—hard, and he looked wounded as Yvlon and Cervial turned.\n“What? They were getting into it.”\n“You sack of tree sap, Gerial.\nI told you to grab him before—\n”",

    "text": "Calruz knew more about hand-to-hand combat than Ryoka had expected. She grudgingly admitted he knew about wrestling, pinning moves—throws and punches and kicks. They were comparing techniques in decent spirit, although the Minotaur kept claiming that Ryoka was ‘just substantively smaller’ than a Minotaur woman.\n“\nI’m not saying you’re inferior in technique.\nBut size matters, and so do Skills. Do you have any in hand-to-hand combat? I thought not. You see, Runner Garia, it’s all commendable. But a warrior is a warrior, a Runner, a Runner. Even Ryoka Griffin would do well to run from any monsters she encounters. Her fists would not be enough to allow her survival in Liscor’s ruins.”\nRyoka raised her eyebrows at Calruz. She shifted in her seat as Garia mumbled agreement to the imposing Minotaur, full of ego.\n“You don’t think I can defend myself? You saw me fight.”\nThe Minotaur had a piece of sausage stuck in his teeth. He picked at it with one long fingernail.\n“I am merely stating the truth. Your fists would do little against most monsters my team faces. Less, since you are female and thus weaker.”\nHe looked around in the hush. Possibly Calruz didn’t see the way Ceria’s back tensed up and the half-Elf’s head came around. He certainly couldn’t ignore the look in Ryoka’s eyes though, and it was to her he spoke.\n“Is it not the truth? Humans are weaker than Minotaurs by birth. So too are you women weaker than men.”\n“Really. That’s what you think?”\n“Calruz. Why don’t you shut up? Ryoka, let us get this idiot out of your face. We’ll give you a—”\nWas it Ceria or Yvlon who spoke warningly? Ryoka ignored it. She reached out and tugged Calruz’s plate away as the Minotaur reached for a sausage. He looked up at her.\n“Right. Your turn. Bring it on.”\nFor a moment, the Minotaur looked confused. Then he looked amused.\n“You. You, Ryoka Griffin, wish to fight me?”\nHe laughed, but Ryoka didn’t. And neither did the other adventurers. Gerial raised his voice as he strode over.\n“Ryoka. This isn’t a good idea.”\nShe ignored him.\n“I’m dead serious. Fight me.

Which wasn’t fair—but she’d also been stabbing a finger into Calruz’s chest the last seven minutes trying to get him to back down—and now she was after Ryoka since he’d refused.\n“You\ndon’t\nchallenge a Minotaur to a fight. What are you thinking? Are you even thinking?”\nRyoka shrugged as she warmed up in the practice arena again. Her nerves were thrumming, but a pit of dark emotions roiled in her chest.\n“You heard what he said about females.”\n“I did. And he’s got a point even if he did make it in the most bull-headed way possible. But that’s Calruz. And even if he’s being an idiot, there’s a big difference between calling him on it and\nchallenging him to a fight.\nYou know you’re going to lose, right?”\n“Not necessarily.”\nCeria stared dumbfounded at Ryoka as the girl stretched on the ground. She looked helplessly at Yvlon.\n“Help me talk sense to her?”\nYvlon nodded. For some reason, she was now all team-Ryoka, which showed what a turncoat bitch she was. Oh, Miss High-And-Mighty now wants to be friends because of girl-power? Ryoka hated that vapid weathercocking.\n“Ceria is right, Ryoka. There’s bravado, and then there’s—this. Fighting me in armor is one thing, but Calruz is a Minotaur. He could rip my head off in unarmed combat without trying.”\n“And he\nwill\nif he makes a mistake.”\n“I guess I’ve just got to dodge, then.”\nRyoka ignored the muted scream of fury coming from Ceria. She eyed Calruz. The Minotaur was actually finishing his meal, holding a plate as he waited for her to finish stretching. His casual indifference just lit a fire in her stomach.\n“Besides, I wanted to challenge him from the start. See how far I can go.”\n“How about into the ground when he puts you there? Ryoka! He’s got to weigh at least two hundred pounds more than you do!”\n“Size isn’t everything.”\n“It’s pretty cursed important in a fight!”\nCeria was right, of course. Ryoka eyed Calruz for the first time as a potential threat. When you looked at Calruz as a person, he was just huge, inconveniently so sometimes. But as an enemy? He was way scarier than any Human Ryoka had ever seen.\nHe was about six foot seven? Maybe a few inches higher, without even counting the horns. And his body was pure muscle. Not like Human muscle, but Minotaur muscle, which was to say that he looked like a wall of tendons and sinews.\nIt was the stupidest thing in the world to challenge him. But Ryoka really,\nreally\nwanted to try. She just wanted to hit the Minotaur, almost as much as she’d wanted to hit Yvlon.\nYvlon. The adventurer was studying Ryoka thoughtfully. It made Ryoka want to punch her again, too. She was so tired and—and frustrated that hitting anything sounded good.\nLike Ceria, if it would get the half-Elf to shut up.\n“Potions don’t fix shattered bones! You know that. And you get him mad—”\n“Look, I’m going to do it. You want to let me focus or go away and shut up?”\nSilence. Ryoka glanced up and saw Ceria giving her a hurt look, full of reproach. The barefoot girl’s heart hurt, but she put the pain and guilt away. She had to focus.\nRyoka was angry. She felt it bubbling in her gut, a seething, roiling ball of pure fury. Where had it come from?\nFrom the High Passes, that’s where. From nearly dying and being helpless even with all the years she’d studied martial arts. From Teriarch and his overpowering magic and arrogance. From the Runner’s Guild and stupid people. From dealing with the ridiculous system of leveling in this world and not least—dealing with some kind of perfect lady knight and a misogynistic Minotaur. It was all bubbling out of Ryoka, and she couldn’t stop it. She wanted to\nhit\nsomething, and Calruz was a big target.\nYvlon sighed.\n“If you’re going to do this—give it all you’ve got on the first shot.”\nCeria spoke bitterly.\n“He’s going to take every hit just to show he can. It’s a Minotaur thing—a sign of disrespect. And…courtship.”\n“Great.”\nRyoka eyed Calruz. The Minotaur was finished eating. He carelessly tossed the plate over his shoulder. Ignoring the\ncrash\nof breaking pottery, he walked into the center of the ring and folded his arms, waiting for her to finish.\nAt last, the girl stood up. She was burning with a desire to fight, almost shaking with it. Ryoka couldn’t keep still as she bounced on her feet with nervous energy.\nCeria eyed the girl as she walked past her. Ryoka stopped.\n“What is it?”\n“You—you’re smiling.”\nWas she? Ryoka couldn’t tell. She only knew that she was ready, more ready than she’d ever been to hurt someone else. She was shaking with the desire to throw a punch. She walked towards Calruz, and the Minotaur impassively looked down at her.\n“What you are attempting is folly, Ryoka Griffin. There are some things that cannot be surpassed.”\nHe really,\nreally\nknew how to push her buttons. Ryoka gritted her teeth and grinned up at him.\n“Oh really? Let’s see what you say in a few minutes.”\n“As you wish.”\nCalruz carelessly raised one massive hand and beckoned Ryoka with a finger. The other adventurers murmured and cheered for Ryoka to hit him with her best shot. The Minotaur didn’t even bother raising his other hand.\nHe was going to try to block her one-handed? But his fur and muscle could probably take any punch Ryoka could throw. She knew that. So instead, Ryoka stomped her foot down in front of Calruz and\ntwisted.\nOne of the core principles of a lot of powerhouse moves was spinning. Ryoka put all her weight on her front leg, twisted, and hit the Minotaur with the back of her heel and all the momentum she’d built up.\nSpinning back kick. Ryoka aimed high. Her leg still caught the Minotaur in his stomach rather than his chest. She felt the contact and heard the Minotaur gasp as the wind left him. She’d put her entire weight into that attack.\nIt was the kind of move you used to K.O. other people, and it was seldom used because of how hard it was to land. But Calruz was arrogant. He’d let his guard down, and Ryoka had held nothing back.\nThe Minotaur’s expression changed. He was obviously trying not to show any pain, but his hand reflexively went down to protect his stomach, and he bent just a tiny bit. Ryoka didn’t wait. Even as her foot came down, she used it as an anchor and swung her other leg up.\nHer leg came up, and she smashed into Calruz’s face with a roundhouse kick. She didn’t break his nose, but that was probably because the Minotaur didn’t have a nice fleshy bit of cartilage like Humans.\nThis time, he bellowed, but Ryoka wasn’t done. She landed and started laying into the Minotaur, punching hard.\nHe swiped at her with one hand. Ryoka ducked under it and belted him twice in the stomach. Calruz shouted as she hit the same spot she’d kicked and shoved her with one arm.\nRyoka was thrown sideways, but she landed, jumped, and kicked the Minotaur in the chest. He staggered back, looking outraged. She pounded his chest.\nNow he was really starting to get angry. Calruz punched at her far faster than she would have guessed he’d be able to move, but Ryoka did the same thing she had to Yvlon. Her head and body were in constant motion as she ducked and weaved, letting the Minotaur swing wide.\nLow kick. Ryoka hammered Calruz’s legs with powerful kicks, wincing internally at the impact. The Minotaur had goat-like legs with cloven hooves, and it felt like she was kicking a baseball bat when she hit him.\nHe nearly got her with an uppercut. Ryoka grinned, turned, and kicked him straight on with a kick to the stomach again. She raised her hands, hit him twice in the stomach—\nAnd then he punched her.",

    "text": "Ryoka jerked upright and felt multiple sets of hands pushing her down. Someone was on top of her. Someone light?\nA pair of pointed ears and hazel hair. Ceria covered Ryoka protectively as she shouted at something. Something?\nA loud\nroar\nof fury made Ryoka sit up. She looked up and saw Calruz being held back by ten men as he tried to rush at her. The Minotaur’s eyes were actually red with rage, and a trickle of blood was running from both nostrils.\nWhat had happened? Ryoka tried to move, felt the agony coming out of her chest, and realized she’d been hit. Hit.\nShe couldn’t breathe. Hell, she could barely move. Calruz was shouting something, her ears were ringing, and Ceria was telling her to stay still. But Ryoka’s blood was still on fire. She still wanted to\nfight.\nShe stood up.\n“Hold it!”\nCeria pushed Ryoka’s shoulder to sit down, but the girl knocked her arm away. She raised her fists, but now Garia, Yvlon, and Ceria were all pulling her back.\nA few feet away, Gerial was swearing and pulling at Calruz with all his might as the Minotaur roared a challenge at Ryoka.\n“Calm down, Calruz! Hold still, dead gods damn it!”\nCeria was talking desperately to Ryoka as the girl strained towards the Minotaur.\n“You’ve made your point, Ryoka. No one’s underestimating you. Let’s stop before someone gets seriously hurt.”\nHer brain wasn’t synching up with her mouth. Ryoka tried a few times.\n“No. Let’s keep going.”\n“Are you\ncrazy?\n”\n“I’m not done. Let Calruz go. I’ll take him on.”\nThe men holding the Minotaur gaped at Ryoka and then redoubled their efforts to hold the raging Minotaur.\n“Enough!”\nAnother man strode forwards and stood between Ryoka and Calruz. He had a huge axe on his back, and he was nearly as burly as the Minotaur, if not quite so tall. He glared at Ryoka.\n“Gerial, get your captain under control. And you, girl, back down!”\nGregor, one of the Silver-rank Captains, scowled as the men eventually managed to push Calruz back. The Minotaur was still breathing heavily, but his eyes were no longer red with fury.\n“This was a ridiculous display. What are you both doing? The Adventurer’s Guild is not a place for anything but training spars, much less unarmed foolishness.”\nHe pointed at Ryoka.\n“You’re a hothead Runner, and challenging a Minotaur just proves how idiotic you are. No matter how good you are with your fists, it won’t help you against monsters. You’ve seen the ones in the High Passes. Swords and even battleaxes don’t work on their hides.”\nRyoka glared at him. His words were true, and they hurt.\n“I survived.”\n“Must’ve been a miracle, then. The way you act, I’m surprised you haven’t offed yourself already. You’re either suicidal or an idiot. Even adventurers don’t pull stunts like this.”\n“I don’t need an axe to do my job. And I don’t need you to tell me what to do. Back off. I’ll take on Calruz without you lot getting in the way.”\nGregor opened and closed his mouth with wordless fury.\n“You blind,\narrogant\n—if Ceria hadn’t jumped in the way, he would have crushed your head like a fruit. You can’t take him. Back down.”\nRyoka eyed Calruz. He was restraining himself—with difficulty—but she knew if the men stopped holding him he’d rush right at her. And she felt like doing the same. Her blood was\nboiling.\n“I can still fight.”\n“Even if you were Level 20, he’d still be able to crush you like a bug! And you’re no warrior. You don’t have any fighting Skills that I saw—”\n“I don’t need Skills to fight.”\n“But you don’t even\nhave\nany levels.”\nEveryone stopped talking. Gregor paused, red-faced, ready to shout and stared at the person who had spoken. Yvlon smiled at Ryoka and nodded once politely.\n“I don’t understand. And truthfully, I didn’t believe my aunt when she told me that. But it\nis\ntrue, isn’t it? I couldn’t believe it until just now, but it must be true. You don’t have any levels or any classes at all, do you?”\nRyoka stared at her wordlessly. Anger surged in her belly. How dare she? How did she know?\n“Not one.”\nCervial spoke from behind Ryoka. He was studying her. As she turned to stare at him, he tapped one eye.\n“[Appraisal]. It’s a Skill that [Marksmen] get sometimes. I can’t see your level or your class.”\nEven Calruz was dumbfounded by this revelation. The adventurers exchanged glances, and Ryoka heard the whispering.\n“No levels?”\n“Why?”\n“Is she some kind of demi-human—no, a monster?”\n“Who wouldn’t level? Is she a fool?”\n“Cursed?”\nRyoka gritted her teeth.\n“I don’t need levels to fight.”\nGregor shook his head at her, disbelieving.\n“What are you, an idiot? How would you survive a second against a monster without levels?”\nThe fury that was boiling in Ryoka seized hold of her tongue.\n“It’s not about levels. Your stupid little system doesn’t interest me. I don’t believe in needing levels or classes. It’s all stupid, and it makes you cowards. Silver-rank? Gold-rank? You just use those words because you don’t have the guts to\nfight.\n”\nThe words came out of Ryoka before she could stop herself. She pointed at Gregor as the man’s face turned red. But all of the adventurers were listening, and Ryoka couldn’t stop.\n“I survived the High Passes without a single level. I did it because I wasn’t\nafraid\nand needed half a dozen people in armor to hold my hand. And if you lot had any guts, you wouldn’t sit around whining about how a bunch of unexplored ruins are too dangerous.”\n“You truly believe you can surpass the rest of us without needing to level don’t you?”\nYvlon stared hard at Ryoka, for once not smiling. Even Garia was staring at Ryoka as if seeing her for the first time. Ceria…Ceria looked upset. Angry—but she was staring at Ryoka as if she were just being let down.\nFuck you too.\nThey didn’t know her. Ryoka was sick of everyone and everything here. She didn’t answer Yvlon. She just wiped at the blood coming from her mouth. But that was an answer in itself.\n“What arrogance.”\nIt came from out of the crowd. Ryoka turned, and this time, the blood in her veins was roaring. She was beyond caring about anything.\n“Really? Arrogance? All I see are people too afraid to do anything until they level up. People who have to hide in a group to cover how pitiful they are.”\nA murmur of hot anger went through the adventurers. Ryoka raised her fists.\n“I’ll take you on one by one or all at once. Come on. Fight me.”\n“Enough!”\nThis time, it was Ceria who shoved at Ryoka. The half-Elf was angry.\n“You’re talking nonsense. But I won’t let you stand here and get yourself hurt. Stop this or I’ll have to use magic—”\nIt was just an impulse. But once it was started, Ryoka couldn’t stop. Her hand shot out and brushed Ceria’s chin. The half-Elf blinked, staggered, and sat down.\nRyoka stared at the half-Elf, rage eclipsed by sudden regret. She hadn’t meant to. She just wanted to get the mage to shut up for a second. But like before, like so many times before, her body had started moving before her brain.\nA roar of anger came from Calruz. Suddenly, he was throwing off the other adventurers as they tried desperately to slow him down. He approached Ryoka, and she tensed.\nBut he didn’t strike at her. Instead, Calruz scooped up Ceria gently. He stared down at her, practically steaming with rage.\n“You tread on Ceria’s honor. For that, I should challenge you to a duel with real weapons.”\n“I’ll take you on.”\nSomething inside of Ryoka was snapping. She was full of fury and beyond caring what would happen next. Calruz seemed to vibrate at her challenge, but with incredible effort, he turned away.\n“You are not worth the time it would take.”\nRyoka’s temper flared. She spoke to the Minotaur’s back, hearing each word leave her lips as some part of her screamed at her not to say them.\n“I didn’t think you were a coward, Calruz.”\nGerial lunged. Not towards Ryoka, but with the rest of the Horns of Hammerad as they seized the Minotaur. Calruz’s head turned, and his eyes darkened with blood and rage. But he didn’t move with Ceria’s limp form in his hands. His voice quivered with fury.\n“I was mistaken about you. You are no warrior. You are just a bully who wants something to hit.”\nHe began to walk away. Ryoka shouted after him.\n“Calruz! Fight me! Come back here, you coward! Are you afraid?”\nThe Minotaur’s back tensed, but he kept walking. Gregor stared at Ryoka in fury, hand twitching towards his axe hilt.\n“Enough! I won’t stand here and listen to this. If you want a fight, try your fists against my axe,\ngirl.\n”\n“Bring it.”\nRyoka raised her hands, but Yvlon stepped forwards.\n“Enough. Restrain yourself, Ryoka Griffin.”\nSomething was snapping inside of Ryoka. It was the same feeling, the exact same. Part of her was shouting for her to put down her fists, to apologize. To get down on her hands and knees and bow before Ceria and Calruz. But like before, like so many times when she’d been kicked out of school, she’d crossed over the event horizon of fury.\nShe just wanted to punch. To hit something. And now that she’d let out all the bile in her stomach, Ryoka only knew how to lash out. So she did.\nHer fist blurred and disappeared as it shot towards Yvlon’s face. But it was intercepted and crossed by a flash of silver.\nRyoka felt the punch lift her off her feet. She tried to step forwards, but her body suddenly forgot how to stand up. She sat down as her arms and legs simply shut down.\nThe world spun, and Ryoka saw Yvlon’s face full of regret and frustration. Her head fell back—",

    "text": "And when Ryoka awoke, she was alone. Not physically alone, but alone nevertheless.\nDusk had engulfed the sky. The sparring area of the Adventurer’s Guild was empty save for Ryoka and the half-Elf sitting on the ground next to her.\nCeria looked up as Ryoka sat up. The barefoot girl looked around, dizzy, and as Ryoka opened her mouth, Ceria tapped her wand on Ryoka’s head.\n“[Silence].”\nRyoka was mute. The girl’s mouth opened, but no words came out. Ceria looked at her and shook her head. She reached behind her and picked up Ryoka’s pack and carefully put it next to the girl. Then Ceria sighed and stared up at the sky.\n“I don’t know what it must have been like, going through the High Passes. You didn’t have more than scrapes on you, but Eater Goats, Gargoyles?”\nRyoka’s mouth was still moving in outrage, and she was getting angry—but Ceria was speaking precisely, like a [Mage], and perhaps it was her magic, but a coolness had fallen over Ryoka. Her bubbling anger…draining away. Growing cold, and with it, her guilt came flooding in, freezing in place. The half-Elf went on.\n“It has to rattle you. Tree rot, getting my leg\nbroken\nwould be enough to put me out of shape for a month. I get it. But—there’s no excuse for just lashing out. You know Hunt, our teammate? He gets raving drunk. Calruz has nearly kicked him out several times. Not because he’s incompetent or a fool—because he gets into fights when he’s drunk. Even if he’s drunk, it’s not an excuse. You get me?”\nWhen she looked over next, Ryoka was silent. Listening—and Ceria went on slowly.\n“Yvlon Byres is a good adventurer. In the shadow of her brother, who’s some famous [Knight] with a Gold-rank team. I’ve never met him, but I know she comes across as snooty. Well, she’s allowed to be. You’re allowed to not like that and even give her a punch, maybe. But at what point is it not her fault?”\nShe rubbed at her chin, and Ryoka saw a faint bruise developing across that fair skin. Now, Ryoka’s temper was completely gone, and she was staring at her lap. Ceria’s voice was polite—pointed—and it was stabbing holes in Ryoka’s side.\n“I’ve seen a lot of arrogance in my time. Mostly from Humans, but from every people, including my own. But someone who rejects the way the world works just because she doesn’t like it—that’s new. It’s been a while since I was hit by someone I call a friend as well.”\nShe looked at Ryoka. The girl couldn’t meet her eyes.\n“If you want to keep fighting everyone who reaches out to help you, I’ll put a flower on your grave. But until then, get your stupid Human head back in order. You’re lucky—very lucky that Calruz\nis\nhonorable and that the other adventurers listened to Yvlon and Cervial, or you might have suffered quite a bit.”\nRyoka was silent. She stared at the ground, face flushed. Memory only now returning. The haze of rage—Ceria spoke sharply.\n“I get it, Ryoka. I do. But you’re even more hotheaded than Calruz. And yes, some of that was his fault, but that was fairly disgraceful.”\nCeria shook her head as Ryoka opened her mouth and tried to say something.\n“No. Be silent. I am angry at you, Ryoka. And I am leaving until that anger is gone. The Horns of Hammerad and the other adventurers are heading to the ruins in Liscor. All of us. At least you stirred the crowd up—Gregor and Menes are back with us. But that doesn’t change what just happened.”\nThe half-Elven mage stood up and brushed at her robes. She waved her wand, and Ryoka felt the spell on her dissipate.\n“May we meet in new forests, Ryoka Griffin. If you want to talk…find us in Liscor. But do any of that again and\nI’ll\ntake you to task, not Calruz or Yvlon. And I don’t punch.”\nOnly then did the young woman realize some of the\nchill\nin the air had been magic, not just the pit of ice in her stomach. The half-Elf pointed down, and the frost and ice anchoring Ryoka to the ground unfroze. She produced a flower of ice in one hand—and then let it melt. Then she turned and walked away.\nSilently, Ryoka watched Ceria go. A thousand words spun through her mind, and she opened her mouth to call something. To say…sorry.\nBut something held her tongue. She held her own tongue and wrestled with it. The lingering desire to curse Ceria and kick her in the back. And why—why? To the one person who’d been kind to her?\nIt was there, a demon in the pit of her stomach.\nWhen the doors to the Adventurer’s Guild closed behind Ceria, it was in silence.\nThe girl sat in the center of the sparring arena and felt the bruises and pain begin to flare up in her body. She was still exhausted, still hurt. But somehow, all of that was a backdrop to the incredible, terrible emptiness in her heart.\nShe’d done it. As before, now again. See—a girl who destroys everything she touches. Who wanders from school to school, never fitting in, picking fights with friends and anyone who crosses her way.\nA child with nothing to hit who decides to fight the world. A barefoot runner who speaks with her fists. A heart full of black fury and hurtful words who spreads her foulness wherever she goes.\nAngry girl. Rabid dog. Berserker. Suicidally competitive. Friendless loner. Lost soul.\nRyoka Griffin.\nShe’d lost friends before. She’d made enemies, burned bridges. Wherever she’d gone, from each school she’d transferred to, she’d left behind only bitter memories. Each time she’d lost control, she’d only left tears and regrets behind. She was used to erasing smiles.\nBut it had never hurt quite like this before.\nRyoka stood up and felt the silence closing in. The silence, and the empty despair that came with it. She looked at the ground and saw the blood of an honorable person. She looked behind her and knew there was no one at her back. A familiar, painful sight.\nShe could barely feel her hands. She was exhausted, upset, guilty, and angry. She didn’t know what to do.\nSlowly, Ryoka’s feet moved. She took one step and then another. Ryoka picked her pack up off the ground and began to walk.\nShe left the Adventurer’s Guild. She ignored the voices, the chances to turn back. She saw the decorated, pink carriage, ignored the [Maids] and [Assassins] that tried to block her way. She just ran on.\nAway, away, always away. Until the dawn broke and the end of day. Running from fear and friends alike, striving to always run, always be in flight. And though her heart bled and ached, she ran on again.\nTowards Liscor and the Blood Fields beyond without a plan. Towards death and the unknown. Running. Always running without pausing. Leaving bloody footprints made of her unshed tears and broken ties.\nRunning.\nRunning away. And oh—but in the grief, in her self-destructive wake, her friends, if she had any, were waiting for her to return. But another group, a trio, followed Ryoka out of Esthelm, jogging onwards with no forgiveness or sympathy in their hearts.\nPersua let Ryoka disappear into the distance before urging Toriska and Claudeil to follow. Her gaze followed Ryoka without blinking, without hesitation. And it was so intent that she ignored Toriska licking her lips every few seconds as she stammered excuses and Claudeil’s nervous breathing, despite them not having run yet. When they ran, they travelled light, with just a few objects in their packs and hanging at their sides.\nPersua followed Ryoka, carrying the same depths the young woman was warring with in the pits of her own soul. Only hers had no remorse. And some of it—sometimes—leaked out Persua’s eyes.\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "When Erin woke up the next day, her eyes were tired and she was full of bleh.\nBleh being her word for her mood.\n“Bleh.”\nToren paused and stared at her. Erin blinked at the walking skeleton with blue flames in its eyes and made weak shooing motions until it went away.\nShe didn’t feel like dealing with it. And by it she meant anything. And that included existing.\nErin stared down into a bowl of chewy oat-equivalents and wondered why the grains had an orange-gold rind. Apparently, they were dried Yellat flakes, a cheap food you could buy. They didn’t taste bad, but the orangy-ness…maybe it was the dirt?\nIt tasted okay, but bleh. And while Erin had money, she couldn’t afford to put much sugar in her meals. She had to save for the future.\nAnd that was bleh. The idea of how much money she needed, the logistics of her inn, and the day-to-day work of maintaining it—it was all bleh, and it could go to bleh.\nAt least now she was able to automate most of the work—or rather, make Toren do all of it. The skeleton bustled around the inn, scrubbing at obstinate stains, hauling buckets of water in, and it had even managed to figure out how to put food on plates and carry them out.\nIt just didn’t have any idea of how carpentry or cooking worked. Erin had tried—but the skeleton didn’t quite get the idea of\nnot\nstirring food with its bony arm or how beds were supposed to look.\nIt didn’t matter. With a little work, Erin had actually managed to transform the upstairs into a livable place. All of the mattresses had been rotted horribly and had to be disposed of, but some of the bed frames only needed a backboard replaced or a few boards changed.\nErin’s inn could now house quite a number of guests. It was just that Erin didn’t have anyone to put up there. And that included her. For the moment, Erin was still sleeping in the little nest she’d made in the corner of her kitchen. She had blankets, pillows, and it was a pain to haul all that upstairs and get situated again.\nThere was always Pisces, of course, but Erin really didn’t need a permanent squatter in her inn. Especially because his only payment came in the form of an occasional rambling lecture to Rags.\n“Bleh.”\nThis time, Toren offered her a cup of juice. Erin took it and drank. It helped, but even a full belly wasn’t improving her mood.\nRags. Goblins and magic. Magic. Erin’s stomach gurgled at her, although that was probably just a reaction to the blue juice and the oatmeal.\nShe spent ten or twenty unhappy minutes in the newly made outhouse, testing the equipment as it were. Afterwards, Erin staggered outside, giving thanks that an equivalent to toilet paper existed in this world. But it was just more proof that this day was going to be a bad one, in her opinion.\nIf there was a bright ray of light on the horizon, it was tonight. Tonight was chess night.\nThat was to say, every night was chess night. Pawn had been bringing groups of Workers over with surprising regularity, and Erin enjoyed playing the Antinium.\nThey never won, of course. Even the best players—Pawn and one of the Workers—never even came close. But Erin loved chess in her bones, and more than that, she enjoyed seeing the Workers improve.\nThey had the most beautiful attitude towards chess she could ask for. Which was not throwing a tantrum when they lost—and she played seriously—but trying to learn. Realizing the game was deeper. It reminded her why she enjoyed the game, and that was a high-point in her life.\nBut that was later. For now, Erin had to go into the city. She needed pillows for her newly refurbished beds.\n“Take care of the inn, okay?”\nToren nodded his head mechanically as Erin stomped out of the inn, her precious bag of coins tucked deep into her pocket. He raised the wet dustrag in his hands like a sword and attacked the dust.\nIf the skeleton had any thoughts on the day, it was simply that it was a shame he wasn’t killing anything. He understood in a vague way that he would not acquire the [Innkeeper] class because he did not in fact own an inn, but the [Barmaid] class was, he felt, something of a misnomer.\nAt least he was Level 2.",

    "text": "As Erin walked through the eastern gates, the Gnoll guard smiled toothily at her.\n“Good day to you, Erin Solstice.”\n“Hey…you.”\nShe had no idea what his name was. But the Gnoll seemed friendly enough. He looked bored, possibly because the only visitor he’d had was Erin.\nNot many people used the road east. North was where the action was—where the main road took you to the northern cities and where all the adventurers, merchants, and general influx of Humanity was coming from. There was a road south, but it seemed few people used the eastern or southern gates at all.\nAnd that was a curious thing. Erin\nknew\nthere was a road that passed by her inn down south, and she’d seen it. But it seemed ill-kept compared to the well-established northern route. And the eastern ‘road’ was almost completely gone. There were only traces that led towards her inn.\nWhy? And why had there been an inn so close and yet so far from the city? Was there once a road there?\n“Yeah, but most of the settlements got destroyed during the wars. Ever since, few people have lived outside of the city. Besides you. And no one goes south unless it’s winter because of the Bloodfields.”\nFor a few seconds, Erin thought the voice had come out of some strange part of her mind. Then she whirled around and realized she’d been talking out loud—and someone had provided her with an answer.\n“Relc!”\nThe Drake leaned on his spear, grinning at her. Sort of grinning. Like the Gnoll, there were a lot of teeth.\n“Yo.”\n“Um, hi. I haven’t seen you around. What’s up?”\n“I was looking for you. You busy? Because you are now.”\n“I was going to buy pillows—”\n“Really? You might have trouble with that. Did you hear what happened last night?”\n“Last night?”\nCurious, Erin followed Relc as the Drake walked speedily towards Market Street. It was disconcerting how quickly he could move despite giving the appearance of ambling along. It was definitely some sort of Skill.\nErin stopped as she turned the corner to Market Street.\n“Oh man.”\n“Yeah.”\nRelc twirled his spear idly as Erin stared at the wreckage. And that was all it was.\nWreckage.\nNearly half of Market Street had been destroyed. Burnt, in point of fact. To a crisp. A fire had swept through the close, confined wooden stalls. They were meant to be just temporary structures, easily deconstructed for the next shopkeeper to display their wares. But the problem was that wood burned easily, and so when a fire did break out…\nEven the stones in the street had cracked from the heat. Erin didn’t know rocks\ncould\nbreak from heating up, but the street had been shattered quite impressively.\n“Normally, someone would have raised the alarm, and we’d have put out the fire quick. But it happened late last night, and by the time we got one of the mages out here, it was too hot.”\nErin glanced at Relc, and the Drake shrugged.\n“Low-level mages. And there’s not much call for water magic specialization around here. We had to let the fire burn out and clear the rest of the street before it spread.”\nIt was destruction. To starve the fire of flames, the Watch and firefighting teams had smashed and cleared the rest of the stalls, shoving the wood splinters out of the way.\nIt hurt Erin’s heart to see. And it hurt even more because the street wasn’t empty. She could see Drakes and Gnolls, shopkeepers staring forlornly at their abandoned goods. It hurt her heart, because she could see some of them were crying.\nScaly or furry they might be, but their tears looked the same.\nRelc stared grimly at the burnt-out street. He spoke quietly to Erin.\n“Everyone’s saying it’s a Human that did it.”\n“Really?”\nProbably everyone was saying that, or at least everyone Relc talked to. Humans might have other opinions. But it probably\nwas\na Human, at least in Erin’s mind. She couldn’t see Drakes being dumb enough to burn down part of their city by accident, and Gnolls were highly flammable. And the Antinium—\nNo. There were already Workers picking through the rubble, slowly and methodically clearing away the destroyed part of the street. They wouldn’t have set a fire.\n“Why would a Human do it, though?”\nRelc glanced at Erin.\n“Oh, it was the mystery thief. Someone caught them last night, and they started a fire to get away.”\n“How? With a match or…?”\n“A what? They used fire magic. A spell.”\nOh. Obviously. Erin’s eyes were caught by an older Drake trying to salvage something from her shop. She spoke distantly.\n“Isn’t there a way to track this thief down? Magic? Or…some kind of Skill?”\nRelc shook his head.\n“This thief has some good magic—and not just the fire magic. A magical item, maybe. And high-level [Guardsmen] do get tracking skills, but almost all of the Watch here are former soldiers. We’ve got more levels in combat classes than our current class. We did have one [Guardsman] with high levels, but that was Klbkch..”\nThe comment hit Erin in the gut, and for a second, Relc looked guilty. But he didn’t apologize.\n“We’re working on it. No one’s happy. Normally, we’d have caught the thief, but there are so many of you damn Humans in the city—no offense.”\nErin took offense, but she let it drop. Relc wasn’t happy. He was staring at his damaged city with narrowed eyes, and she didn’t have anything to say. Certainly nothing to defend the thief. So instead she changed the subject.\n“I…haven’t seen you around the inn lately.”\nRelc shrugged again indifferently.\n“Too many damn Goblins around. I’d clean them up, but apparently that’s not allowed.”\nErin glanced sideways at Relc. The Drake met her eyes and then went back to studying the street.\n“They’re not all bad, you know.”\nHe snorted.\n“You think the little freaks you’ve been feeding are\ngood?\nI hear they’ve been fighting a war with the rest of their tribe—when they’re not scaring travellers and stealing their goods.”\nFor a moment, Erin felt a lurch of panic and fear in her chest.\n“You’re not—not going to have to hunt them down are you?”\n“I don’t really care. So long as we don’t get orders, we’ll leave them alone if they stay clear of the city. Goblins are part of the wild. If you get rid of too many, the bigger monsters don’t have anything to snack on.”\n“Oh. Um, t—”\n“Don’t thank me. I just don’t feel like doing more than I have to for my job, that’s all.”\nSilence. Erin stared at the ground. Relc’s eyes narrowed as he watched the Workers slowly sweeping down the street.\n“\nThey\ndon’t even care Klb died.”\n“Yeah. They, um, don’t seem to care about death. It’s not their fault.”\n“I know. They’re bugs. But Klbkch was special.”\n“He was.”\nYet the Workers didn’t mourn him, and that hurt Erin—but it hurt Relc more. She thought the Workers had their reasons, but Relc just kept speaking, louder, his tail lashing faster.\n“Not just because he was a guard, y’know? He was different. He had a\nname.\nI couldn’t believe it when he introduced himself. And he’s the only Antinium I’ve ever heard of with a level higher than 10. He was special.”\nErin was silent. She stared at the large Drake and saw his chest heaving with emotion. The Drake’s fist tightened on the shaft of his spear.\n“But they don’t care. They talk about Klb as if he’s just gone off somewhere. As if his death never happened. Even the Queen didn’t put up much of a fuss.”\nErin thought about the massive Antinium Soldiers marching down the street and taking her to meet the Queen.\n“You think so?”\nRelc eyed Erin darkly.\n“You’re not dead, so I’d say she took it well. She kept talking about ‘time lost’ and ‘needless valuable resources expended’ when she talked with the Captain. But never about Klbkch.”\nThe Drake’s head bowed. He stabbed his spear into the paving stones, and the stones\ncracked\nand shifted around the tip of his spear. He leaned on it, staring darkly down at the ground.\n“No one cares.”\n“I care.”\n“I know. But you’re different.”\nFor a while, the two stood still, awkwardly, alone rather than together. Erin’s heart\nhurt\n. But though the Human thing to do would be to pat Relc on the back or say something meaningless, she knew he didn’t want anything from her.\nHe still hated her. Or if he didn’t hate her, he blamed her.\nAnd she would say nothing against that.\nAt last, Relc shifted his weight and pulled his spear out of the street. He looked down at Erin.\n“By the way—and not that I care too much, but you should know—there’s a new Prognugator in the city.”\nThe word sounded familiar. Erin frowned.\n“A what?”\n“It was what Klbkch was. Don’t ask me what it means. It’s some important role in the Antinium Hive. Their war-leaders were called that—but Klbkch told me it’s deeper. They’re pretty much like Watch Captains, though. For their entire Hive.”\nThe idea of the Antinium needing any kind of policing sounded ridiculous to Erin. She couldn’t imagine them doing anything criminal, but then she remembered Klbkch herding the Workers like cattle. Maybe a Prognugator was like some sort of sheepdog, only with people.\n“Okay. Is he going to be part of the Watch?”\nUnexpectedly, Relc frowned.\n“I hope not. Not if I have anything to say about it. I think this one will stay in the Hive.”\n“Okay. Why are you telling me, then?”\nRelc hesitated.\n“He looks—familiar. Just don’t freak out, okay?”\n“Sure.”\nThe Drake scratched at the spines on his head.\n“Right. Well, I’ve got to go back to work. Oh—that’s right. I’m supposed to give you a warning.”\n“A warning?”\n“Yeah. Apparently you got into a fight with a bunch of adventurers, right? Beat them up and stole their stuff?”\nOh. Erin felt like slapping herself. Of course.\n“Um, yes. I did. But they were attacking—”\n“The damn Goblins. Whatever. Don’t worry; I’m not going to arrest you. I’m just giving you a warning. I also hear you’ve got a pet skeleton.”\n“Yes. His name’s Toren. Uh—”\n“I don’t care. It sounds creepy, but whatever you Humans like is fine by me. Just keep him out of the city. I just needed to give you a warning.”\n“Not to do it again?”\nRelc looked surprised. Then he grinned.\n“Oh, no. When we heard about three Human adventurers getting their tails kicked by an Innkeeper, some Workers, and a few Goblins, we laughed our scales off. We don’t care about what happens to those Humans. Just keep the skeleton away, and if that crazy [Necromancer] tries raising any more bodies, stop him.”\n“You’re not going to do anything? Really?”\nThis time, the Drake lowered his voice, glancing around surreptitiously.\n“Maybe if we had time—but we don’t. The Watch is overwhelmed right now. Those damn adventurers keep disappearing into the ruins, and we’ve had to patrol the area to catch all the things that come crawling out of there.”\nRelc made a face and twirled his spear in one hand. Erin’s stomach decided it was time to start lurching. She would have preferred it stay on ‘bleh’.\n“Things? Like…what kind of things?”\n“Squiggly things. Lots of white tentacles and flesh. Disgusting. We think there’s some kind of brood monster in there, but no one who goes in that far has come out to tell us what it is. And the rest of the cowards are just clearing the rooms one at a time.”\nRelc sighed, muttered a bit about Humans and adventurers in general, and glanced at the sky.\n“I’ve got to get back there.”\n“Oh. Okay. I’ll see you around.”\n“Maybe.”\nThe Drake raised one hand in farewell as he trotted off. Erin watched him go. Her eyes turned back to the ruined street.\nMisery and devastation. It wasn’t hers, but she still felt for the people affected by the fire. A thief and the ruins.\nNone of these things were her problem. But they\nwere\nher problem because she lived here. Not by choice, but Erin felt like the city was suffering. Suffering, and she wondered what it would take to heal.\nAt the very least, Erin wouldn’t get her pillows today. Not unless a certain Gnoll had any in stock.",

Come back another day, please.”\nKrshia barely had the time to spare as she talked seriously with a bunch of angry Gnoll and Drake shopkeepers. The merchants of Market Street were gathered together in some sort of conclave, and Krshia was one of the more influential—and vocal—shopkeepers in the crowd.\nErin left them to it, especially because she was getting a lot of casually hostile glances. It was completely understandable that the shopkeepers were angry, and there were other things she could do. Like talk with friends.",

She and the other three receptionist Drakes were trying to deal with multiple adventurers at once while the room was full of arguments, minor scuffles, spirited dialogue, and not least, the\nclank\nof countless weapons and armor rubbing together.\nThe female Drake shook her head as Erin repeated her question.\n“I can’t, Erin. We’re all working overtime as it is. All the adventurers coming through—excuse me, the Human with the red hair and face-thing?”\nSeveral adventurers looked up, and the mustached adventurer stepped forwards, holding a bag of dripping somethings. He looked so amazingly hurt that Erin bet no one had ever referred to his mustache as a ‘face-thing’. Selys gestured impatiently to the side.\n“Give that to Warsh, please. The Drake over there? The one with yellow scales? Thank you.”\nSelys turned back to Erin and shook her head. The other girl nodded, tried not to touch the shouting adventurer covered in blood and…guts, and made her way out of the building.\nIt was completely fine. Selys had a lot to do, after all, and the Adventurer’s Guild in Liscor was never meant to deal with the huge influx of treasure seekers. It was too bad. But it was just—it was just—",

    "text": "“It’s just that\nI\ndon’t know what I should be doing, you know?”\nErin complained as she moved a knight on the chess board and stole one of Pawn’s rooks. The Antinium made a sound of dismay but kept staring at the board as Erin chattered away.\n“I get that Krshia and Selys are busy. And so is Relc, although we barely talk and he hates my guts. But what should I do? I mean, obviously I’m running the inn, but I feel like there’s something else I should do. Something…useful besides cooking, eating, and paying for pillows.”\nCarefully, Pawn moved one of his knights forward. Instantly, Erin took it with a bishop, trading the pieces. It wasn’t a good exchange—as bishops were technically worth about the same strategically as knights, but it did open up Pawn’s king for a lovely attack by Erin’s queen.\n“I mean, what should I do? I need money, but it’s not as if this inn is hopping at the best of times. And I need several hundred gold pieces. That’d take years. The only way I might get that much money in one go is to become an adventurer, but I don’t really want to stab stuff or have my insides yanked out through my nose.”\nPawn desperately tried to search for a winning strategy on his invaded side of the chess board. He found one—the same strategy that would end up in a checkmate eight moves down. Erin had noticed that three moves ago.\nDelicately, the Antinium moved a pawn forwards and spoke.\n“I am not sure I have any advice to give you, Erin Solstice. I am not experienced in the ways of this world.”\n“You probably know more than I do.”\n“It may be so, but my knowledge extends mainly to my Hive. I was not\nI\nuntil very recently. Thus, my awareness is only now expanding.”\n“I get it.”\nErin sighed, took one of Pawn’s pieces, and waited for him to take her rook.\n“I just wish I didn’t feel this way.”\n“Which way is this?”\nPawn took her rook. Erin took his queen.\n“So useless.”\nA faint groan escaped the Antinium Worker. He studied the board and then shook his head.\n“I have lost.”\nThe other Workers nodded in agreement as they stared at the board. The pairs that were playing glanced up and stared silently at Pawn’s board before returning to their games.\n“Good game. You want to play another round?”\nPawn nodded, and the two players began rearranging the board. It was their fourth game, and they’d been playing long enough that the sun was already fading behind the mountaintops.\nIt was fun to play. But Erin had the same feeling she was trying to express to Pawn. It was fun to play, but she never\nlost\n.\nThat was okay. She was, if not as incredible as an International Master or even a Grandmaster, at an exceptionally high level of play back home. The love of the game and teaching new players was enough—and they were very good despite having picked up the game a week ago. Yet chess…if the world were decided by chess games, it would be so much easier for her.\n“I just wish I could do something important, that’s all. Something useful.”\n“Was Erin important back in her world?”\n“What? No. Not at all. I was just a girl who played chess. Heck, I wasn’t even in college yet. I was trying to save up money for that.”\n“Then the Erin of now is surely an improvement as she is both an [Innkeeper] and one who teaches chess. I fail to understand the problem.”\n“Well, yeah, but—”\nA few tables down, Rags snorted loudly. Erin looked over. The Goblin stared silently at her and then reached over and poked the Worker’s king with one finger. It toppled over.\n“Hey! That’s really rude!”\nRags made a face as Erin glared at her. But the Worker she’d been playing bowed its head towards Erin.\n“This one had lost the game. This one apologizes for time wasted.”\n“It’s not your fault. Even if the game’s nearly over, you’re the one who decides that. Knocking over someone else’s king is rude. Got it?”\nThe Worker bowed his head, but Rags just scowled. Erin amped up her death-glare, and Rags reluctantly muttered something.\nIt was pretty much the only problem that reared its head when Erin had everyone playing chess. In the hierarchy of skill within the inn, Erin was the undisputed champion. After her came Pawn and Rags, with Pawn being the better player, but only just. Below them were various Workers who could play decent games, but Rags was never quite happy unless the little Goblin was playing Erin.\nIt was an issue of arrogance, and Erin remembered what it was like—being impatient at having to play mediocre players. But Rags was still a rank novice by Erin’s standards, and rudeness in chess was something she wouldn’t tolerate.\nBut still, Rags hadn’t played Erin yet tonight. Reluctantly, Erin looked at Pawn.\n“Sorry, but do you think—?”\nThe Antinium was already shifting from her table. His courteous nature never failed to surprise Erin. She sighed as Rags jumped off of her chair and marched over to her table.\n“Okay, let’s play. But if you touch my king, I’m going to chop you up, got it?”\nThe Goblin didn’t answer. She was already rearranging her pieces.\nSighing exasperatedly, Erin waved a hand.\n“Toren! I’ll have some water.”\nThe skeleton who had been moving around the room with a huge bowl of Acid Flies turned and nodded. He disappeared into the kitchen and reemerged with a tall glass of water in his bony hand.\nThere were some benefits to having a skeleton waiter. Not least of which was that Erin could devote all of her time to playing chess. She sat back as Rags studied the board and waited for the first move.\nThe Goblin played unusual strategies all the time, which made her a delight to duel. By contrast, Pawn had the fundamental moves memorized and played solid games. It won him more games, but Erin had to admit she admired the Goblin’s daring in her aggressive tactics.\nRags’ fingers closed around a pawn, and then the Goblin froze. Her pointed ears twitched, and she stared at the door.\nErin looked up. A few seconds of silence passed, and then she heard someone knocking politely on the door.\n“Come in!”\nThe door slowly swung open. Erin caught a glimpse of a familiar black body and four arms and smiled. Another Worker to play with. But then her thoughts hit a snag. Workers couldn’t leave the city without Pawn. They were—\nThe Antinium stepped fully into the inn, and Erin froze. She was dreaming. Rags had stabbed her in the chest, and Erin was dying on the table. She’d had a heart attack—or a stroke, and this was the last thing she saw before she died. It had to be that. She had to be dreaming.\nBecause the Antinium who walked into the inn could not be who she thought he was.\nOn first glance, he looked like any other Antinium. He had four arms, antennae, large multifaceted eyes, and the two curiously segmented legs all lined with brown-black exoskeleton. That was normal.\nBut this Antinium was different. He was built slimmer than the Workers, and his carapace might have been a shade darker. But more than that, he resembled someone Erin knew. In every small detail, in every part of his body, from the way he stood to the two swords and two daggers at his side, he looked exactly like—\n“Klbkch?”\nThe Antinium turned his head, and Erin felt her heart stop for a moment. He bowed his head to her and approached.\n“Good evening. Am I speaking to the [Innkeeper] known as Erin Solstice?”\nHis voice was exactly the same as Klbkch’s. Erin wrestled with words around a tongue that had stopped working.\n“Yes—yes I—are you—?”\nThe Antinium nodded.\n“Allow me to introduce myself. I am not Klbkch. Please refrain from making this error in judgment at any point in the future. My name is Ksmvr of the Antinium of Liscor. I serve my Queen as Prognugator. I have come on business of the Hive.”\nIt wasn’t Klbkch. But it\nwas\n. Erin was struck dumb for words. He stood like Klbkch. His swords were the same as Klbkch’s, although the steel was just that instead of the silvery metal. Even the way he walked and talked was—\nShe was trying to come up with a response and not start crying at the same time while she digested his words.\nKsmvr paused and then nodded.\n“I understand my resemblance to my predecessor has caused issues. I apologize for any confusion.”\n“Oh, no—”\nErin wanted to say ‘it’s nothing’, but it would be a lie. She sat still, rigid in her seat as Rags stared hard at Ksmvr. All the other Workers were frozen in their seats. But Pawn—\nKsmvr looked around the room. His silent, studying gaze found each Worker as the other Antinium stared at the floor. Then he spotted Pawn. The Worker hesitated and half-rose from his seat.\nInstantly, the air rang as Ksmvr’s blades shot out of their sheathes. The Antinium held all four arms on guard and pointed one of his daggers at Pawn.\n“Remain still, Worker.”\nErin gaped. Pawn began trembling, and the other Workers instantly began moving out of the way. Ksmvr advanced, swords at the ready.\n“Wait. What are you doing?”\nKsmvr’s head moved sideways a fraction as he spoke. But his blades never shifted an inch.\n“I have come to ascertain the state of the Worker which refers to itself as ‘Pawn’. I will bring this Worker back into the city with me. I apologize for any inconvenience.”\nHe stood over Pawn and raised one sword just under the tip of the other Antinium’s chin.\n“Stand. Make no sudden movements. You will be questioned.”\nMeekly, Pawn did as he was instructed. Erin was staring, horrified. It seemed like—\n“Wait, I don’t understand. Why are you taking him? Has he done something wrong?”\nKsmvr paused. He seemed reluctant to explain.\n“…It is common knowledge that those Antinium who refer to themselves as individuals or have names are subject to fits of violence and unpredictability. More, I cannot say, but my role is to judge such errant individuals and terminate them if necessary.”\nThe casual way he said it made Erin’s blood run cold. And now that she was thinking again, she saw Pawn was trembling as Ksmvr held his sword under his chin.\n“Wait a second. Wait a second. I know Pawn. He hasn’t done anything wrong, and I’ve been playing chess with him every day for the last few weeks. Why are you taking him now?”\nAgain, Ksmvr paused before replying.\n“The Hive within Liscor has been in—disarray. My appointment to this position was out of necessity. All shall be restored to order shortly. Until then, I carry out my roles.”\nHe looked at Pawn.\n“We will return to the Hive. Any actions will be met with appropriate punishment. Is that clear?”\nPawn nodded. He slowly moved with Ksmvr’s blade poking into his back. The Prognugator would have pushed him out the door, but Erin was suddenly in the way.\n“Hold it.”\n“Please move aside, Erin Solstice.”\n“You haven’t explained anything. Pawn did nothing wrong. He has a name, but I was the one who gave it to him. What do you mean you’ll terminate him? And—and why do you look like Klbkch? What’s a Prognugator?”\n“I am on business of my Hive. I cannot answer your questions. Please move aside.”\n“No.”\nPawn spoke. His voice trembled with nerves as he spoke to Erin.\n“Please, Miss Solstice. This is a matter of the Antinium. I knew it would come. Do not interfere—”\nKsmvr moved. His sword flashed, and Pawn\nscreeched\n, clutching a severed antenna.\n“The Worker will remain silent.”\nQuaking, Pawn clutched at his bleeding stump and shut up. Ksmvr prodded him forwards, blade tips sinking into the Worker’s exoskeleton, but now Erin was right in front of him.\n“That’s enough. Pawn is my guest. I won’t let you take him.”\nKsmvr stared at Erin expressionlessly.\n“Interfering with my duties is a crime.”\n“You\ncut\nhim for speaking. I’m not letting you anywhere near him unless you explain things. No—better yet, I want to go with him.”\n“That is unacceptable. Move aside.”\n“No.”\n“I will not request twice. Be warned—”\n“I said\nno.\nDidn’t you hear me?”\n“I did. Very well.”\nErin didn’t see the Antinium’s hand move. But she felt something solid strike her so hard she saw stars and tasted blood. Erin stumbled away and heard a furious\nclatter.\nToren rushed at Ksmvr, barehanded except for a spoon it had picked up from a table. Ksmvr turned his head calmly, and two of his arms moved.\nThe hilt of his sword and dagger smashed into the skeleton so hard that the undead construct paused. Ksmvr’s arm blurred again, and suddenly, Toren was headless.\nWith one leg, the Antinium\nkicked\nthe skeleton across the room, scattering Toren’s bones. He turned calmly back to Pawn.\n“Move. Walk slowly without deviation.”\n“W-wait.”\nErin could only see stars. And her jaw was already swelling, but she still staggered towards Ksmvr. She stopped as two daggers pointed her way.\n“Your interference has been noted. Your complaints will be heard by my Queen once she has completed her business. Regrettably, she is indisposed at the moment, but you may request an audience at a later date.”\n“I won’t—let you take Pawn. You don’t have to do this.”\nKsmvr paused and then shook his head. He spoke without inflection.\n“My position is temporary. But any possibility of a Worker becoming Aberration must be dealt with swiftly. Interfere and I will be forced to consider you an enemy.”\nHe opened the door. Pawn meekly walked through it. Ksmvr paused, one hand on the door. He nodded at Erin as the girl stared at him, horrified.\n“Good day to you. My apologies for the interruption.”\nThe door closed behind him softly.",

    "text": "Erin stared at the door for a full minute, thoughts whirling, before she moved. She paused only long enough to make sure Toren was reassembling himself. Rags was squatting next to the skeleton, offering it bones and watching with interest as the skeleton pieced itself together one part at a time.\nShe had no time to wait for the skeleton. Erin ran into the kitchen and reemerged with a frying pan, the biggest one she had. She flung the door open and made it two steps outside before the Workers grabbed her.\n“Let—go of me!”\n“Innkeeper Solstice must not interfere. Innkeeper Solstice must not.”\n“Get off! I’m going to save Pawn! Let go!”\nErin struggled, but three Workers had her in grips like steel, and the others were surrounding them. They spoke—a group speaking as one.\n“The Prognugator must not be disturbed. The Prognugator will slay all who interfere. Innkeeper Solstice must not die. Innkeeper Solstice must not die.”\nErin struggled. The Workers didn’t want to hurt her. At last, she managed to wriggle out of their grips. She broke free of the mob and ran down the hill towards Liscor.\nShe made it several miles before the Workers caught up. They weren’t fast, but they didn’t tire. They held her.\n“Innkeeper Solstice must not.”\n“Why?”\nShe shouted it at the Worker who’d caught her. He flinched, but she was beyond caring.\n“What is that Ksmvr guy doing? Why does he look\nexactly\nlike Klbkch!”\nThe Worker hesitated and then shook his head.\n“It is forbidden to speak of Hive matters to outsiders. This one may not speak.”\nErin snapped. She took a deep breath and shouted in the Worker’s face.\n“I am your chess teacher! I am Innkeeper Solstice, and I\norder\nyou to tell me!”\nHe hesitated. Erin grabbed him by his cool, smooth exoskeleton.\n“\nTell me!\n”\nThe Worker hesitated. He looked at the other Workers surrounding him, and she saw them agree almost as one. It looked hesitantly back at Erin.\n“This one—these ones believe the individual known as Pawn will be interrogated.”\n“Interrogated? Why?”\n“To determine if the individual known as Pawn is Aberration.”\n“And if he is?”\n“He will be executed.”\nErin’s blood went cold. She struggled, but the Worker held her.\n“That’s crazy! Why? What did he do wrong?”\n“Those who are Aberration kill. They are Individual and reject the Hive. They destroy.”\n“But Pawn\nisn’t\nviolent!”\nErin stopped and stared at the Worker.\n“He isn’t. You know it. I know it. He hasn’t done anything. So he’s not an Aberration, right?”\nThe Worker hesitated again and stared at his comrades.\n“It may be so.”\n“It\nis\nso!”\n“No Worker who has become individual has ever not been Aberration.”\n“None?”\nErin stared at the Worker. He and the others shook their heads.\n“Pawn is different, though. He is. So—that Ksmvr guy will let him go, right?”\nThey hesitated.\n“\nRight?\n”\n“If the individual known as Pawn is not Aberration, he may be allowed freedom within the Hive.”\nErin was no good at reading Workers’ expressions. But even she could tell that the Workers didn’t think this was very likely. She stared at them.\n“I’m going to stop it.”\n“It is too late. The Hive will be sealed while the individual known as Pawn is questioned. Innkeeper Solstice will not be able to enter.”\n“I must.”\n“It is impossible. Innkeeper Solstice must go back to her inn.”\n“I’ve got to go. I\nmust.\n”\n“It is impossible.”\n“\nI must go.\n”\n“It is impossible.”\n“I—”",

    "text": "In the end, the Workers left. And they left Erin behind. She stood, holding the heavy frying pan in the middle of the plains, and watched the Workers slowly trudge across the dark plains towards Liscor.\nShe wanted to run after them. But they’d convinced her—finally convinced her—that even if she followed them there would be nothing she could do. They would enter the Hive, but apparently it would be sealed by the fearsome Antinium Soldiers, who would kill her on sight if she intruded. And Ksmvr would be deep within the Hive, interrogating Pawn for signs of Aberration, whatever that meant.\nErin would never reach him. So she stayed and felt like she was betraying Pawn. But she would never reach him. All Erin could do was pray.\nSlowly, Erin walked back towards her inn. Her mind was full of confusion, fear, panic, a whirlwind of emotions. But those thoughts vanished from her head when she heard the shouting.\nIt came from her inn. Erin stared up the hill and saw a group of dark shapes standing outside the inn. They were yelling something.\n“Goblin!”\n“More of them over there! Kill them!”\n“Watch it! One of them knows magic!”\n“Get it off! There’s a skeleton too! Toss me my sword!”\nErin ran. She charged up the hill as fast as she could. Her inn was lit from the inside, the lamps Toren had lit the only light besides the stars. In the glow from the windows, she could see seven—maybe more people—striking out at Rags and her group of Goblins.\nThey’d been caught unawares, but the adventurers were already pulling out weapons. One of them—a massive Minotaur—pulled a humongous battle axe from his back and swung it with a roar of fury. Rags dodged the massive blade as it bit into the soil with a shrill cry of alarm. She swung her short sword, but a mage in robes pointed, and the Goblin had to dive or be consumed by the flames that shot from the mage’s staff.\n“\nHey!\n”\nErin didn’t even bother with words. As the adventurers charged, she raised the frying pan and\nhurled\nit as hard as she could at the Minotaur. The pan flew straight at the massive bull-man’s head, courtesy of Erin’s [Unerring Throw] Skill.\nThe Minotaur blinked as the pan flew at him. His hand shot up, grabbed the cast-iron skillet by the handle, and halted it in midair.\nErin froze. The Goblins took one look at the Minotaur holding the frying pan and ran. One of the adventurers raised a bow, but Erin ran forwards and\nkicked\nhim in the stomach. He doubled over.\nSuddenly, Erin was alone and surrounded by adventurers. They stared at her, confused. One of them—a girl with pointy ears—held up her hand and stopped the other adventurers from attacking. The Minotaur stared at Erin, curious.\nHe’d stopped the flying frying pan of justice with one hand. Erin gulped and thought fast. Her attack had failed, although Rags and her friends were clear. So that left words.\n“Hey! What do you think you’re doing?”\nThe adventurers stared incredulously at her.\n“What do you think\nyou’re\ndoing?”\n“I own this place! What are you doing attacking my guests?”\n“Guests?”\nA guy with a long mustache gaped at Erin. He stared at the fleeing Goblins.\n“They’re\nGoblins!\nAnd there’s a skeleton in there!”\nHe pointed at Toren, who was lying disassembled inside of Erin’s inn.\n“They’re my guests. And that’s\nmy\nskeleton you just beat up! This is my inn, and no one kills Goblins around here! Didn’t you read the sign?\nDoes anyone read the damn sign?\n”\nThe adventurers, or rather, the Silver-rank adventuring group known as the Horns of Hammerad, stared at each other in confusion. The night sky made everything nearly impossible to see. Gerial stared at Erin and then looked around.\n“There’s a sign?”",

    "text": "Erin sat in her inn, staring at the group of men, women, and one Elf and Minotaur as they sat awkwardly across from her. All of them stared alternatively at her and at Toren as the skeleton walked around the inn, cleaning up the Workers’ dishes and the chess sets.\nThey weren’t about to say anything else, so Erin spoke.\n“Let me get this straight. You guys are an adventuring group, and you just happened to drop by.”\n“That’s right. We knew there was an inn in the area, and we wondered if it was still open.”\nThat came from the Elf-girl, sitting closest to Erin. She was distractingly beautiful, with features that were literally nothing like anything Erin had seen in her world. She smiled politely at Erin, and the girl had to prevent herself from gaping.\nErin looked at the Minotaur instead. He was also something she’d never seen, but she wasn’t as distracted by him. Rather, his bullish head and rippling muscles made her feel like she was talking to a cow that had decided to start working out and was walking around on two legs.\nWhich, when you got down to it, was pretty much a Minotaur.\n“So you lot came here, saw the inn was full of Goblins, and decided to kill them all, right?”\nThe adventurers shifted in their seats. One of them shrugged.\n“Well—yes.”\n“\nWhy?\n”\nThe armed men and women exchanged glances. One literally trapped a finger against her helmet and grimaced in confusion. Another—a guy in armor with a flowing mustache—shook his head.\n“They’re\nGoblins.\nThey’re monsters. We’re adventurers. I’m sorry Miss, but we were just doing our jobs.”\nErin knew that, but she didn’t have to like it. But they hadn’t killed any Goblins, and she’d made them explain three times already. And they were staring at her, so she decided to change topics.\n“Okay. So you’re adventurers from up north. You said you had a name…?”\n“The Horns of Hammerad.”\nThat came from the Minotaur. He was still staring at Erin curiously, but without threatening to rip her head off, which is what she sort of assumed was Minotaur behavior.\n“And how did you know the inn was here?”\nThe man with the mustache cleared his throat awkwardly.\n“We were, ah, here before.”\n“I don’t remember that.”\n“I believe you were out at the time.”\nCeria smiled at Erin. She nodded to the skeleton.\n“But I can prove we weren’t doing anything wrong. We were here to meet a certain [Necromancer] at the time. It’s just a guess, but I’m betting you know him.”\nErin looked at Toren, and the skeleton looked inquiringly back at her. He was still wearing his sword belted to his bony waist, and the skeleton was eying the Horns of Hammerad as if it considered them to be a threat. Then she focused on the [Necromancer] part and groaned through her teeth.\nEven when he was gone—Pisces! She spoke slowly, but with a growing sense of resignation.\n“I might know him. This, uh, necromancer. Can you describe him?”\n“He’s quite annoying.”\nErin’s head ducked.\n“Right, that’s Pisces. Okay, so you know him. And you’re here. And I guess you didn’t see the sign about not killing Goblins. Mistakes were made.”\nErin sighed and tried to relax. She looked at the group of adventurers again.\n“So, what do the Horns of Hammerbad want with me?”\nThe Minotaur’s eye twitched, but the Elf spoke again. She might be their leader, or maybe it was mustache-guy.\n“We’re looking for a place to stay.”\nErin looked blank. She pointed out the window.\n“The city’s that way.”\n“Yes, but every tavern, inn, and home is full to the rafters with adventurers. There’s nowhere to sleep—not even in a shed. So we came here.”\nErin still looked blank.\n“Why?”\n“This…is an inn, correct? Don’t you have rooms to rent?”\n“What? Oh.\nOh.\nYeah, I’ve got them. Tons of them. All empty.”\nSilence. The Horns of Hammerad exchanged a glance. Ceria coughed politely and smiled at Erin.\n“Could we perhaps stay here? I promise you we won’t cause any trouble, and we have plenty of coin.”\nThat had a hollow ring to it after the earlier incident. Erin thought it over, chewing at her lip.\n“I don’t like people who attack Goblins. They’re my guests, and you chased them off.”\nThis comment seemed to seriously annoy the Minotaur. He leaned forwards, snorting, but mustache-guy pushed him back in his chair. From his seat, the Minotaur snapped at Erin.\n“Those creatures are scum. They should be exterminated.”\nErin’s brows snapped together. The other Horns of Hammerad groaned, and the Elf kicked backwards, hitting the Minotaur’s shin. All that happened was that she winced.\nMustache-guy smoothed his mustaches and looked concerned. He spoke to Erin, attempting a charming smile.\n“I assure you, Mistress, um, Erin. This was all a mistake. If we’d seen the sign, we wouldn’t have attacked.”\n“Hm.”\nErin eyed the adventurers. She still wasn’t happy, not least because they were in her way while she was still thinking about Pawn. She made up her mind rapidly.\n“Look, you didn’t kill the Goblins. So I guess I’ll forget that. But if you stay here, you will either obey my rules or you can sleep outside. Got it?”\nAll of the Horns of Hammerad nodded at once. Only the Minotaur did not. Erin stared at him.\n“How about you, bull-guy?”\nHis eyebrow twitched, and everyone else in the inn winced. The Minotaur stared at Erin hard, but she didn’t look away.\n“Everyone else seems like they’ll be okay, but are you going to obey my rules, or do I have to kick you out?”\nThe thought of her kicking the Minotaur out was ridiculous, but Erin was too angry to care. The Minotaur stared hard at her, blew out air exasperatedly, and finally nudged the Elf-girl aside as she silently kicked him under the table.\n“Upon my honor, I promise. I will not attack any of your guests unless provoked.”\nThat seemed like it was all Erin was going to get. She nodded.\n“Okay, then. In that case, I have a few rooms upstairs. Enough for all of you. But I don’t have any pillows.”\nThe Horns of Hammerad smiled in relief. The Elf spoke to Erin.\n“That’s fine. We can make do.”\nErin nodded and stood up. Her mind was blank. What were you supposed to say at times like this? Guests. She had guests. She picked a direction and put her mouth on autopilot.\n“Your rooms are upstairs. Go ahead and pick whatever one you want. We might have to get two beds for cow-guy, but it should be fine.”\nShe pointed at the kitchen.\n“Breakfast is in the morning. There’s no alcohol, but I’ve got plenty of food. There’s an outhouse outside—just be careful that you don’t walk into a monster. If you see a huge moving rock, shut the door and stay quiet. Don’t go into the kitchen if you want something to eat—there are jars of acid lying around. Don’t drink anything green in general. No killing Goblins, the skeleton works for me, and if you see an ant-guy with two swords and two daggers, hit him and make sure he doesn’t go anywhere. Got it?”\nThe Horns of Hammerad hesitated, then nodded. Erin waited and then shrugged.\n“That’s about it. I’ll make some food if you want anything.”\nShe stomped out of the common room and into the kitchen. Bemused, the adventurers watched her go. For a few seconds, they heard her talking to the skeleton, and then Erin walked back out. She pointed at the adventurers.\n“One more thing. Do any of you play chess?”\nAgain, all of the adventurers had to exchange glances of confusion. At last, the mustached man looked back at Erin and raised one eyebrow.\n“What’s ‘chess’?”\nErin sighed.\nHollowstone Deceivers (Rock Crabs)\nby\nEnuryn\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "Erin dreamt of swords flashing, of cannonballs exploding around her, and of blood. Rivers of blood.\nKlbkch stood in front of Erin and asked if she were ready. She looked at him as he bled in her arms. His mandibles opened, and he rasped into her ear.\n“I obey my Queen.”\nShe shook her head. Dream Erin pointed and showed Klbkch a massive chess piece sitting on a hill.\n“The King. It’s about the King. The king is smart. He—”\nShe was no longer holding Klbkch. Instead, Erin sat and watched as a body fell to the ground and oil burned around her. A dead Goblin’s face stared at her, and she woke in a cold sweat to see Toren standing in one corner of her room.\nIt was better. Infinitely better than seeing the dead. Erin still threw her pillow at him. It struck him in the face—not hard, but loud enough to startle someone.\n“Whu?”\nIt came from outside the kitchen. Erin was immediately seized by panic. She looked around for her frying pan and then remembered.\nShe had guests.\nBlearily, Erin kicked her bedding into one corner of the kitchen and walked out. It was still close to dawn, but surprisingly, someone was awake.\nCeria blinked several times at Erin and nodded her head. It seemed the Elf mage was an early riser, but even she was half-asleep.\n“Whu?”\nShe repeated the word. Erin swayed on her feet.\n“Hrgh.”\n“Mm.”\nConversation done, Erin stumbled back into the kitchen to make food. Toren stood by, handing her pan, spatulas, and various food items as she pointed and grunted. Breakfast was scrambled eggs, toasted bread, bacon from some animal, and sliced cheese.\nIt was unnatural how she could make a proper breakfast, but Erin wasn’t thinking about that at the moment. Her hands moved automatically as she thought about her dream.\nIt had meant something. And for some reason, even though Erin had been dreaming about death and battle, she’d been thinking about chess. She\nalways\nthought about chess, even when she was asleep.\nStill caught in the last fragments of her dream, Erin muttered the words.\n“The king…the king is smart. He uses something. His head?”\nErin scratched at her own head, wondering where that line had come from. Well, obviously it was about chess. But had she heard it somewhere? She felt like it was important.\nThe bacon was finished and sizzling. Erin picked the fried strips of meat out of the pan, wincing at the spot of oil that landed on her arm.\n“Ow. Ow.\nOw!\n”\nToo much oil. Erin had forgotten. It really got\nhot\nwhen you heated it up—\nThe smell of burning flesh. Erin paused and looked around. A dead Goblin Chieftain lay on the floor.\nThe slice of bacon slipped from her tongs. Nimbly, Toren dove and caught the bit of meat and delicately put it back on the plate. Erin blinked and came back to life.\n“Oh—thanks.”\nShe put a hand to her head and quickly finished frying and stacking the rest of the meat. She’d made a lot. Enough for a small army, which was what she assumed ten adventurers and a Minotaur qualified as.\nBut since they weren’t awake, after Erin finished with the eggs, she only made one plate for Ceria. She absentmindedly dumped bacon, eggs, and bread together, ignoring the aesthetics of eating for the substance of eating itself.\nWhy was she thinking of the Goblin Chieftain? Why had she had that dream? Sometimes, yes, Erin woke up sweating and crying in the middle of the night. But never had her dreams followed her out of her sleep like this.\nIt was a sign. A sign that Erin needed to find a better place to sleep, perhaps.\nHer stomach rumbled. Another sign, indicating she was hungry. Erin stared down at the two plates that were as close to an American breakfast as she knew and smiled. Ceria probably would like this, especially with blue juice. Too late, Erin remembered she had an Elf in the other room.\n“Oh no.”\nErin stared down at her meal of bacon and scrambled eggs. She couldn’t go out with this. Desperately, she scrambled around, looking for anything that remotely resembled produce. It was so\nhard\nto keep vegetables in the inn because she didn’t have a refrigerator!\nShe found a head of lettuce and some tomatoes. Feverishly, Erin fried more eggs and added it to some toasted bread. That would have to do. Hopefully, Ceria ate eggs. Were Elves vegetarian or vegan?",

    "text": "Ceria stared blearily at the table, trying not to fall asleep. She wasn’t a morning person. People expected half-Elves to rise with the dawn and frolic in the dewdrops and flowers or some such nonsense. But Ceria had lived too long among Humans and other species to like getting up early, and she didn’t frolic.\nAn enticing smell was coming from the kitchens along with much banging about. Ceria tried not to listen. She was concentrating on a spell.\n“[Illumination]. No—perhaps I’m doing it wrong?”\nShe should have the spell mastered, but it was giving her trouble. [Illumination] was an advanced version of the [Light] spell Ryoka had learned, and technically, it was only Tier 2 magic. But in truth, its complexity was around Tier 3. Possibly even Tier 4 in scope. Normally, Ceria wouldn’t have bothered learning it, but the spell could illuminate over a hundred meters around the caster by shedding orbs of light. It was perfect for dungeons.\n“And of course, it’s up to the Wistram mage to do it. Is it a hard spell? Yes! Then let the half-Elf do it! Don’t get any of the other mages. Ceria’s got it covered!”\nCeria growled and slapped the spellbook in front of her shut. She was hungry, and now that she smelled breakfast, she really couldn’t concentrate.\nRight on time, someone exited the kitchen holding two big plates full of food. Ceria brightened—\nAnd nearly blew the skeleton’s head off when she saw it. The undead creature paused and stared at Ceria’s wand as the mage caught herself. It had one arm cocked to throw the plate at her head.\n“Toren! Stop that!”\nSomeone smacked the skeleton in the back of the head, making it stumble and nearly drop its burden. Ceria saw the strange [Innkeeper] glare at the skeleton and point at the table where she sat.\nQuickly, Ceria lowered the glowing wand as Erin approached.\n“Ooh, is that a\nwand?\n”\nThe half-Elf blinked at Erin. She paused and then smiled ruefully.\n“Yes it is. Would you like to see?”\nErin peered excitedly at the long, slender piece of wood. It didn’t look carved like the ones she’d seen in certain movies. Rather, it looked like it had been plucked off a tree and stripped of all branches. The wood was a pale white tinged with the faintest hint of green. All in all, it was ordinary except for the pale, blue-white wisps of light flickering around the tip.\n“That is so\ncool!\n”\nCeria was mildly taken aback by Erin’s enthusiasm. She held out the wand to Erin, much to the other girl’s surprise.\nErin hesitated, her hands itching to hold the wand. She glanced at Ceria.\n“Is it really okay if I touch it?”\nCeria had to smile.\n“It’s not that fragile. Go ahead. And it’s not that expensive. Sort of expensive, but the real thing is far, uh, ‘cooler’.”\nReverently, Erin ran her fingers along the wand. It didn’t feel that different, to Erin’s slight disappointment. The wood was smooth and polished, but it didn’t feel\nspecial\n. Her fingertips touched the wand’s tip.\n“\nAh! Cold!\n”\nCeria snatched the wand back, and Erin stared at her hands. The fingers that had brushed the wand tip were white, and frost had coated the very tips. The Elf tossed the wand on the table and grabbed Erin’s hand.\n“Are you alright?”\nBehind Erin, Toren’s glowing eyes flashed menacingly. The skeleton took a step forwards and met an elbow to the ribcage from Erin. She glared at him until he retreated and then looked back at Ceria. The touch of the Elf’s skin on hers felt very light and ethereal, just like how the rest of the Elf looked. Gingerly, she pulled her hand away.\n“I’m fine. Go away, Toren! Go get us something to drink.”\n“I’m really sorry about that. I didn’t expect you to touch the wand tip. Have you never seen one before?”\nErin blew on her fingers and rubbed them frantically to warm them up. They were tingling horribly, but aside from the first bite of extreme cold, they seemed to be okay.\n“No—sorry. I didn’t know I wasn’t supposed to touch them.”\n“It was my fault. I forget how much non-mages don’t know.”\nCeria looked abashed. She held up the wand and tapped her finger close to the tip.\n“All the magic of the wand is channeled through the tip. That’s why it glows or reacts depending on the spell stored. It’s also why you should\nnever\nbreak a wand because it will trigger the spell.”\nShe picked up her wand and began tucking it up her sleeve. Erin saw there was an armband so that Ceria could holster the wand along her arm. She shuddered.\n“Won’t that freeze your arm?”\n“Oh, no. I can deactivate the magic. I only activated it because, well—your skeleton surprised me.”\nErin turned and glared at Toren, who’d reemerged from the kitchen with a jug in one hand and cups in the other.\n“Sorry about that. He keeps doing that no matter how much I tell him not to.”\nSilently, Ceria watched the skeleton place a cup before her and Erin and fill both up to the brim. Quite literally to the brim.\n“\nToren!\nHow are we supposed to drink it like that? Don’t fill the cups all the way to the top, just\nalmost!\n”\nThe skeleton looked abashed. Erin glared at it and then turned to Ceria. The half-Elf cautiously managed to take a drink of the sweet, pulpy liquid without spilling any. Her eyebrows lifted.\n“This is good!”\n“I know, right? It’s from this fruit I found around here. Anyways, here. Breakfast is served!”\nSo saying, Erin pushed a plate towards Ceria. The half-Elf looked down and found herself staring at scrambled eggs, toasted bread, and a spreadable cheese on the side—and for some reason, a big bowl of what looked entirely like lettuce and tomatoes. And no bacon.\nShe looked over and saw Erin had a plate full of eggs and bacon. Ceria’s stomach rumbled, and she wondered how she was going to correct this mistake.\n“Well. This looks…lovely. Thank you for making breakfast so early, Miss Solstice. And I’m late in saying it, but good morning.”\n“Oh. Thank you!”\nErin paused and then snapped her fingers.\n“Oh. Wait! I know this one!”\nBemused, Ceria stared as the other girl scratched at her head. She muttered to herself and then looked at Ceria.\n“Um…\nElen síla lúmenn’ omentielvo?\nIs that right?”\nThe half-Elf froze, mouth open with one spoonful of eggs hovering just over her plate. Erin blinked innocently at her.\n“What—what was that?”\nErin blushed.\n“I was trying to say good morning in your language. Or maybe it’s just hello. Did I get it right…?”\n“My language?”\n“Elvish, right?”\nThe bit of egg slipped from Ceria’s spoon back onto her plate. Erin was getting more embarrassed by the staring, so she tried to explain.\n“I once went to a Lord of the Rings chess tournament because I heard a national champion played there. People wouldn’t play me unless I could at least say ‘hello’.”\nCeria understood exactly none of what Erin had said. Her mind spinning, she put down her spoon quite calmly.\n“Miss Erin, I’m not sure what you might be thinking but—I’m not an Elf.”\nThis time, it was Erin’s turn to stare.\n“You’re not? Oh man. I just thought—”\nCeria touched the pointed tips of her ears that Erin was staring at.\n“I’m not an Elf. I’m a half-Elf. And besides which, you wouldn’t see—an Elf anywhere.”\n“Really? Why not?”\nErin was full of round-eyed curiosity. Mindful of her sleeping friends upstairs and because Erin seemed genuinely confused, Ceria did her best to keep her voice level and not shout.\n“No one has seen an Elf for thousands of years. Tens of thousands. They all died long ago. That bit you spoke—was a joke, right?”\n“Oh. Um—yes?”\nCeria watched as Erin sat back in her chair, disappointment clearly written all over her face. The conversation stalled as both young women tried to wrestle with what had been heard.\nFor her part, the half-Elf had to believe that bit of nonsense-language was a joke. Because if it wasn’t…\nCeria felt—amazed at Erin’s ignorance, but the nature of their conversation was familiar. She’d had the same sort of odd explaining to do, but when—?\n“Well, I’m, uh, really sorry about the mix up. I just thought you looked so amazing and, um—are half-Elves like Elves? Or—or is there anything I should know?”\nAwkwardly, Erin pointed at Ceria’s plate.\n“I didn’t know what you people—I mean, what you could eat. If you need something special, I can get it. Anyways, we’ve got salad. Um…there are some tomato-like things I bought from the market, carrots…lots of soup. And, uh, I’ve got bread and cheese if you want to eat that.”\nCeria raised both her eyebrows in amusement.\n“I can eat meat, you know.”\nAgain, the Human girl paused and seemed to struggle with something. Then, silently, she switched her plate with Ceria’s. The [Mage] brightened as the aroma of fried meat drifted upwards.\n“So you eat meat?”\nCeria nodded happily.\n“I’m not sure what you’ve heard, but my people aren’t averse to eating meat. I quite enjoy pork, for instance, especially when it’s been properly cooked. Or when it’s not.”\nErin stared at Ceria, round-eyed.\n“Really? That’s so\nweird\n.”",

    "text": "When the rest of the Horns of Hammerad finally woke up, it was because they smelled the food. Adventurers, being the sort of people who were used to waking in a moment’s notice to avoid dying, generally slept in if they could help it. But they were also big fans of eating, so when the smells of cooked food finally wafted upstairs, their stomachs dragged them out of bed.\nGerial stumbled down into the common room of the inn and brightened the instant he saw what Ceria was eating. He sat down at a table, wondering if he should call for a barmaid, when he saw the skeleton march out of the kitchen.\nCeria caught the vice-captain of the Horns of Hammerad as he went for his belt dagger.\n“Easy. Don’t threaten it and it won’t attack.”\nGerial paused and nodded. He let his heartbeat slow from the sudden jolt he’d received and warily let the skeleton put a heaping plate of food in front of him. The skeleton set down a cup, pointed to a jug of blue liquid on Ceria’s table, and walked back into the kitchen. Sheepishly, Gerial met Ceria’s gaze.\n“Good thing you caught me. I’d forgotten—”\n“Don’t worry about it. I made the same mistake earlier.”\n“Good morning!”\nGerial looked up and gave Erin a smile as she bustled towards him, silverware in hand. The skeletal waiter had forgotten it, and Erin also filled up Gerial’s glass with the strange blue liquid after giving him a choice between it and water.\n“Thank you for the meal, ah, Miss…”\nCeria supplied the name.\n“Solstice.”\n“Oh, just call me Erin. Anyways, I’ve got more food, so just shout if you need some.”\n“You’re most kind. And this looks delicious.”\nErin smiled and walked off, already chatting to Sostrom and the [Ranger], Marian, from the Horns of Hammerad. Gerial eyed his plate, delighted at the glistening oil on his fat strips of bacon and the mounds of eggs and pieces of bread buried next to them.\nHe took his first bite and grinned at Ceria.\n“Good food.”\nShe was already eating again.\n“Isn’t it? Try the blue stuff.”\nCautiously, mindful of Ceria’s sense of humor, Gerial did. His eyes widened.\n“It’s\nsweet!\n”\nCeria and the other Horns of Hammerad grinned at Gerial’s reaction. He’d already drained his cup by the time Erin came back around.\n“Good service, food, and we’re not getting dirty looks every two seconds. We struck it lucky coming here.”\n“Good thing we didn’t get into it with those Goblins.”\nCeria nodded as Gerial removed some grease from his chin with a handkerchief.\n“Still—”\nGerial craned his neck and saw only the skeleton walking around offering drinks to adventurers reluctant to accept. Reassured, he continued speaking to Ceria. Neither adventurer noticed how often Toren kept passing by their table despite their full glasses.\n“What an odd innkeeper.”\n“She’s definitely strange. Goblins\nand\na skeleton. But Pisces is probably to blame for the skeleton. Still—Goblins.”\n“Did you see what one of them was armed with? A…a jar of something?”\nCeria smiled with dark humor.\n“It set off my [Dangersense] when it pulled it out. Guess what was in it?\nAcid\n. I had a look in the kitchen. She’s got jars of Acid Flies—a local creature around here. Looks like she’s been harvesting them as a food source.”\nGerial paused as he munched down on his bread, appetite suddenly lost. Ceria shook her head at him.\n“Oh, stop being squeamish. Drakes eat them, and so do the Antinium, I bet. Not that we’d see the ant-men here, but I can see how it would be useful.”\n“But the bugs—”\nGerial eyed his plate uneasily, imagining how an insect might crawl into a cooked meal. Ceria glared at him.\n“Do you think she’d leave any of them alive? They were all dead. Honestly, you Humans—”\nShe trailed off and shook her head.\n“Well, I get it. Bugs aren’t my favorite thing to eat either.”\nThat\ncomment nearly made Gerial choke on his drink. But Ceria continued, thinking aloud.\n“I’m not sure if she’s just absentminded or if she doesn’t realize how dangerous arming Goblins is. That acid can melt skin in seconds. But besides that, it’s odd to see her living so far out from the city.”\n“Not too far. It was barely an hour’s walk even with us getting lost.”\n“True. But monsters don’t care about distance. And that skeleton doesn’t look\nthat\npowerful.”\nGerial nodded. The skeleton didn’t set off any internal alarm bells when he thought of it as a potential foe. It was dangerous and no mistake—but it was no Lich or even a stronger variety of the undead.\n“Maybe that’s all the protection she could afford.”\n“In that case, she’s reckless or insane. Or—poor. Actually, She reminds me a bit of Ryoka.”\nGerial stared incredulously at Erin as she began haranguing Toren.\n“In what way exactly?”\nCeria shrugged, unable to explain.\n“They’re not too similar personality-wise, but…it’s just a hunch.”\n“Well. So long as we’re here, monsters aren’t an issue. And this\nis\na good inn.”\n“Right. If we want to keep using it, we’d better spread the word to the others. If they come in and start something—”\n“Got it. I’ll tell the others when I see them. You still working on the spell…?”\nCeria made a face.\n“Working on it. It’s complex. Give me two days and I’ll have it done. We probably have enough time for that, right?”\n“Probably. Calruz and the others will meet to discuss tonight, but we’ll need to interview other adventurers and see what’s been found. You’ve got at least four days by my count.”\n“Okay then—”\nEvery adventurer looked up at the heavy\nclomping\nsound of massive footsteps coming down the stairs. Calruz blinked a few times and scowled at the skeleton as he entered the common room.\n“Hey there!”\nErin was already setting the table next to Ceria and Gerial with a huge plate of food. Calruz grunted in appreciation and sat down.\nThis meal was mainly eggs and bread…and a bowl of lettuce and tomatoes for some reason. Gerial frowned as he saw there was absolutely no meat whatsoever on the plate as Ceria slapped her forehead gently.\n“Hey, Mr. Bull Guy.”\nAcross the room, Gerial saw Sostrom choke on his drink as Erin addressed Calruz. The Minotaur frowned up at her as the Human girl smiled at him. Even sitting down, the Minotaur was nearly as tall as she was.\n“I wasn’t sure if you ate meat. I’ve got some bacon. Made from pork—I think, so there’s no beef.”\n“I can eat beef.”\nCalruz grunted at Erin. She smiled in relief and waved at Toren. The skeleton approached with another huge plate of sizzling bacon. The Minotaur accepted it from Erin’s hand and grunted with satisfaction. Then he eyed her again.\n“Also, Innkeeper. My name is Calruz, and I lead the Horns of Hammerad. Any title is fine, but—‘Bull Guy’—I would prefer you not call me that.”\nErin slapped a hand to her forehead.\n“Oh no. Is it a racial thing? I’m sorry! I didn’t want to use your people’s word. What should I say instead?”\nCalruz’s left eyelid twitched involuntarily. He took a deep breath and let it out slowly. Ceria and Gerial held their breaths.\n“We’re not bulls. Or\ncattle.\n”\n“What\nare\nyou, then?”\nThis time, Calruz eyed Erin long and hard to see if she was joking. But she seemed completely earnest.\n“A Minotaur.”\n“\nWow.\nI thought you were, but you look a lot different than the pictures.”\n“What did you think I looked like, then?”\nErin waved her hands and gestured helplessly.\n“Oh, I don’t know. Less—hairy. Sort of like a Human with a Minotaur’s head. And your horns are really cool.”\nShe pointed to Calruz’s long horns, and this time, Gerial thought the Minotaur would erupt. But he seemed mollified by Erin’s amazement.\n“I don’t know what kind of Minotaurs you’ve heard of. But I accept your mistake.”\nHe began eating, considerably faster than Gerial and Ceria but with his utensils and without creating a mess. Erin paused, clearly thinking of something else. Reluctantly, Calruz looked up.\n“What?”\n“Um. Do you like mazes?”",

    "text": "Erin learned a lot about Minotaurs on that day. They were pretty polite, good eaters, could actually eat beef if they wanted to—but they weren’t fans of lots of questions.\nShe watched the Horns of Hammerad leave the inn and troop towards the city and stared at what they’d left behind. Money, of course—they’d paid in advance and handsomely too, and that was only for the first night. And they were coming back for dinner, but it was the other thing that they’d left which was bothering her.\nDishes. Lots of dishes.\nErin stared at the stacks of dirty silverware and porcelain and pointed at Toren.\n“You wash that.”\nThe skeleton nodded—almost glumly, Erin thought. It hauled the bucket of water up and poured it into a pot to heat up over the fire while Erin opened her pantries, dreading what she might find.\nTwo minutes later, Erin rushed out of the inn.\n“I’m out of\nfood!\n”\nShe paused, ran back inside to grab her money pouch, and then ran out again. Toren rushed out behind her.\n“Stay there! Wash the dishes!”\nHe halted, clattering his jaw as Erin raced down the hill.",

    "text": "“Okay, make that\nten\nsausages, and I need a bag of salt, too. Oh, and some cooking oil.”\nKrshia nodded and shouted something in her growling language to another Gnoll across the street. Both shopkeepers disappeared and began pulling out the various foodstuffs Erin had requested.\nIt was easier to go to Krshia for everything she wanted, Erin had found. The other Gnoll could direct her to the right shopkeepers, and that way, Erin knew she was never being ripped off.\n“Is there anything else, Erin Solstice?”\n“Um…”\nErin looked around. Market Street was still half-destroyed, but the part that hadn’t been burnt down had already resumed business as usual. And indeed, a large part of the burnt street had already been replaced by the industrious Workers. Shopkeepers had already set up their stalls, and if you ignored the black soot on some buildings and the ground, it looked like everything was normal.\nThe only difference was the Guardsman walking down the street every few minutes and the unfriendly looks that were being directed at every Human who entered. Erin got her fair share of glares, but it seemed like the shopkeepers knew her face, so at least they didn’t mutter insults when she walked by. At least, none that she could hear at any rate.\n“I don’t know. What would you recommend, Krshia?”\nThe Gnoll propped her hands on her hips and thought.\n“Hm. These are adventurers staying at your inn, yes? Then buy ale or something to drink, yes?”\n“Ale? Oh, right! Sure! Give me a, uh, barrel of that.”\nKrshia smiled but shook her head.\n“It should be a keg for now. Transporting a barrel is hard, yes? And my Runner—he is overworked. He will not be able to transport your goods until tomorrow, even without a barrel to drive, yes?”\n“What? Tomorrow?”\nErin’s face fell. She’d gotten used to the unfriendly, silent Gnoll who drove a cart to her inn every time she needed a delivery. True, it wasn’t ‘running’, but Krshia told her Street Runners often used carts to carry heavy deliveries, unlike City Runners. Whatever that meant.\n“Can’t you get it to me sooner? I’m out of food at the inn!”\nAnother shake and Erin had to step back to avoid the flying brown fur.\n“My apologies. But it is a busy time, yes? So many customers, which is good. But not for you, yes? I can lend you a cart, but that is all.”\nDisconsolately, Erin stared at the small mountain of goods she’d bought. Krshia had marked it and set it aside for the Runner to pick up. It was—well, it was a\nlot\n. She’d bought it thinking she wouldn’t have to carry it. But since she did, suddenly Erin regretted her spending.\nBriefly, she wondered if she could get away with only taking a little bit. But the adventurers ate so\nmuch,\nand they were her first real guests. She didn’t want to disappoint them, but the sun was already high in the sky, and she needed to make lunch soon.\nThere was no helping it. Taking Toren into the city was more trouble than it was worth. If she wanted to get it back, she’d have to make several trips with a handcart between feeding her guests. Erin sighed.\nBut then she brightened. Moving through the crowd, she spotted a group of people who were out of place. At least, out of place for what she considered to be Liscor’s unusual crowd. She spotted a woman in silver armor, a huge guy with an axe, and several other Humans walking with a tall Minotaur she recognized.\nErin raised her hand and waved.\n“Hey!\nHey! Hammer captain!\n”",

    "text": "“Why are we doing this again?”\nGregor, Captain of the Silver-rank team of adventurers known as Kyrial’s Vanguard, complained as he finally reached the top of the small hill where The Wandering Inn stood. He was wearing his armor, of course, and his iconic battleaxe as well, but the big man had another burden.\nA sack of onions and five freshly baked loaves of bread, to be precise. And a narked expression, but that didn’t weigh anything.\n“We’re here because we want to use this inn for planning and the innkeeper needs food. And because helping out is the polite thing to do.”\nYvlon smiled at Gregor and winked silently at Erin as she carried along two hams.\n“Exactly. And it’s not\nthat\nheavy.”\nGerial had to wheeze that last comment. He’d been carrying a bag of flour by himself and was regretting it, especially with the weight of the rest of his armor.\nCalruz grunted irritably. He dropped the bags of flour he’d carried pointedly into Toren’s arms as the skeleton emerged from the inn. The skeleton staggered under the weight as it carried them into the kitchen.\n“This was not warrior’s work.”\n“No, but it was necessary, and I appreciate it.”\nErin grinned at Calruz as she hauled a smaller bag into the kitchen. She poked her head out.\n“Besides, if you didn’t help out, I wouldn’t be able to make lunch! This way, you can eat and complain at the same time, Mr. Grumpy!”\nCeria smiled and dropped the links of sausage on the table.\n“Touché. She’s got you there, Calruz.”\nYvlon and the other adventuring captains dropped their burdens on tables and looked around the inn. Cervial whistled appreciatively.\n“And you lot have this entire inn to yourself? We’ve barely standing room in our inn, and we’re sleeping three people to a room. Mind sharing?”\nGerial laughed as he massaged his shoulder.\n“Talk with the innkeeper, but we’ve occupied most of the second floor.”\n“And we’re not giving up our rooms!”\nThat came from Ceria. The half-Elf sighed as she sat back in a chair and accepted a glass of water from the skeleton. She’d gotten used to the undead creature, but the eyes of the other captains followed Toren as he walked back into the kitchen.\n“You told us, but I didn’t believe—”\nThe Mage-Captain, Menes, was the least-surprised.\n“It’s not\nthat\nuncommon. Other nations use the undead, although I’ve never heard of one serving drinks. What do you think, Byres?”\nEveryone turned to the one person who’d be most unhappy about the skeletons—but Yvlon Byres exhaled slowly. She tossed her hair behind her and smiled in thanks as Erin handed her a cup. Then Yvlon looked at the other captains as they too were given refreshments and a promise of lunch for their hard work.\n“I think…I’d rather have somewhere to sit and plan than cause a fuss and have to squeeze into a corner of the inn. Let’s drop it.”\nShe eyed the skeleton, but everyone else agreed to that, thinking of their lovely accommodations. Gerial rubbed his hands together with a big smile as he saw the sausage links being ported into the kitchen. He looked around good-naturedly, and everyone else relaxed as the first blue fruit drinks came out with the water.\n“Well, we’re here a bit sooner than I thought, but shall we begin planning?”",

    "text": "Time didn’t seem to be on Erin’s side. Well, it was passing by, but far too quickly for her liking.\nIt seemed like she’d just woken up, made breakfast, and bought some food before it was lunchtime. And then she’d made lunch, cleaned up, and suddenly it was\ndinnertime\n.\nBut that was the thing about catering to a crowd; it took a long time, and Erin had to keep making food in preparation for people eating food. So although the night came quickly, she was quite, quite conscious that she’d worked through the day to get to it.\nErin stopped to wipe a layer of sweat from her forehead and wince because she’d smeared tomato sauce all over her brow. Oh well, it wasn’t as if her face had been that pristine to begin with. And she was too busy to wash it away.\nShe glanced out at the clouded night sky and wondered if it were time to shut the window in the kitchen. She’d undone the shutters here to cool down the stiflingly hot kitchen, but it looked like rain, and the last thing she needed was a wet kitchen floor.\nThe nights were getting colder. Already, Erin had taken to closing all the windows by the evening, and tonight was especially chilly. Dark storm clouds had swallowed the sun hours ago and promised to drop their cargo sometime tonight.\n“Winter is coming.”\nToren paused and cocked his head at her. He probably hadn’t heard what Erin had said. She waved her hand at him, and he exited the kitchen.\nShe was done with her plate of spaghetti. Well—plates. Erin lifted one in each hand carefully—she could do more, but it was heavy porcelain, and she didn’t feel that rushed—and walked out into the common room.\nA wave of noise greeted her. Adventurers sat around her room, talking, laughing, arguing. It was such a bizarre sight in her inn that Erin had to pause. But she was on a mission and the food was heavy, so she made her way to the two tables that had been pushed together in the center of the room.\n“What do you\nmean\n, wait?”\nCalruz slammed one fist down on the table, making Erin nearly jump. He was shouting at a bunch of men and one woman—all adventurers, allegedly. They’d come into the inn around lunchtime with a few of their friends and had stayed around, talking.\nWell, mainly arguing. Ceria and Gerial sat next to Calruz, wincing as the Minotaur expressed his discontent. Each of the other adventuring captains also had a vice-captain with them.\n“We’re not ready to go in, Calruz. We need supplies. We thought we could get them here, but prices are high and supply is low. Besides that, we need to send some scouting teams in. And there are other adventurers to consider letting join—”\n“We\nknow\nwhat’s in there. And the Ruins are less than an hour’s journey from the city! We don’t need supplies or\nscouts\n!”\n“We agreed to come Calruz, but that doesn’t mean we put ourselves under your command. We’re all equals here, and we go in properly or we don’t go in at all.”\nThat came from Menes, the only other mage at the table besides Ceria. He smiled and thanked Erin as she put his food in front of him. Then he returned his attention to Calruz.\n“There are some Silver-rank adventurers in the city. Some good ones that I know. It wouldn’t hurt to have them with us, and as Cervial said, we need time. A day or two of delay won’t lose us any time. Myself, I’m more concerned about our formations. Ceria has said she can learn the [Illumination] spell in time, but even if we get that cast, how will we approach the actual exploration phase? I’m not too keen on splitting up our vanguard—”\nGregor shifted. He’d been busy chomping down on slices of ham, but he stopped to glare at Menes.\n“You can’t be suggesting we keep our forces together. The time it would take—”\nErin stopped listening. She was busy, and the adventurers had been arguing\nall day\n. That was preferable to them having, say, a bar fight, but she was busy.\nShe spun past her inn, taking requests for food, filling empty mugs, and generally wishing she was less busy. The door opened, and Erin turned to smile at the newcomer and explain that skeletons and Goblins in general were friendly.\nShe didn’t have to. Pisces stood in the doorway, blinking in surprise at the crowded inn. He paused, looking around as if he thought he were in the wrong place. Erin waved at him.\n“Sit over there!”\nShe pointed to a lonely table. Pisces hesitated, still eying the adventurers, but eventually went and sat down. He paused as he passed by the table where adventuring captains were sitting. They looked up, and Ceria spoke.\n“Pisces.”\nThe [Necromancer] nodded to her. The two locked gazes like cat and dog. No…that wasn’t fair. They tensed up, and Erin had only seen that look of hostility and regret on Pisces’ face once when he thought she was selling him out to the Watch. On Ceria’s face? Pained regret and her own unspoken anger.\nHe nodded slowly, face pale.\n“Ceria.”\nThey seemed unable to say more than that. So—almost accidentally, someone ran into Pisces, and he started.\n“Hey, Pisces! Stop bothering my customers!”\nErin booted the mage in the back, much to the amusement of several of the adventurers. Pisces glared at her and glared harder when Toren came by to hand him a menu.\n“I must protest! My creation is not meant for menial tasks. Moreover, I am an accredited [Mage] and deserve to be treated—”\n“Food!”\nErin dropped a plate in front of Pisces and left. She was so\nbusy!\nIf this was what having an inn was like, she seriously needed another skeleton. Or\ntwo.\nToren was practically dashing about, serving the wary adventurers with mechanical precision.\nThis was why an inn had a cook and bar-people. Come to that, a bartender would also have been helpful, as well as another keg of ale. Erin had long ago run out, and the adventurers had been disappointed to learn she didn’t have any more. She probably could have made a fortune on that alone.\nThe door opened. Erin turned, prepared a smile, and then smiled for real.\n“Olesm?”\nThe blue Drake staggered into her inn, looking around wildly. He spotted her and rushed towards Erin, heedless of the other adventurers who’d gone temporarily silent at the sight of a Drake.\n“Erin! I did it! I\ndid it!\n”\n“Did what?”\n“I finally solved it!”\nThe Drake crowed and danced about, waving the slip of parchment at Erin. She blinked at him, confused.\n“It was the work of days—no, nearly a\nweek!\nIn the end, I had to lock myself away, but I did it! And I leveled!\nTwice!\n”\n“Wait, twice? What?”\nShe had to get him to stand still to show her, which was no mean feat. Erin saw a very inky piece of paper and the notation for four chess moves. A solution to a chess puzzle. Her puzzle.\n“Oh, you did it! Congratulations!”\nShe smiled at Olesm, and he gave her a toothy grin in reply. He looked delirious with delight, but his eyes were also slightly unfocused, hinting that he was delirious in more ways than one.\nDrakes didn’t have whites in their eyes. Like the Gnolls, their eyes were a single color with a dark, snake-like pupil in the center. Olesm’s eyes were a marvelous shade of blue patterned wildly like raindrops falling.\nThey were also bloodshot and wild. Erin noticed Olesm seemed gaunt and thinner than she’d seen him last. He also had an unwashed smell and…was that dead skin on the side of his neck? No—dead\nscales.\nThey were flaking off, and it looked like a terrible fungus infection the more Erin stared at it.\nShe was trying not to, really. But it was extremely distracting.\nOlesm noticed where Erin was looking and blushed. He immediately covered the spot with one hand.\n“Um—I’m\nso\nsorry. I haven’t bathed or cleaned myself in a while. I was just so happy to have solved it I rushed over. But I did it at last! It was the greatest challenge I’ve had, and the rewards were—rewarding!”\nHe smiled in a state approaching bliss. Erin had to smile with him as she led him to an empty table and waved at Toren for a drink.\n“It took a week, huh?”\n“Just a bit less than that, I believe.”\nGratefully, Olesm accepted the mug and then stared in horror at the creature that had served it to him. Meanwhile, Erin was trying to remember. She’d given him a chess problem? Oh! Oh yes, it was the one she’d sent to the mystery chess game enthusiast. Olesm had said he was going to make a copy.\nAnd it had taken him a week? Erin was…impressed.\nShe\nwas\nimpressed. It had taken her nearly a week to solve the problem as well. Admittedly, she’d been going to class and only spent a few hours here and there trying to solve it. And she’d been in middle school. But still.\nIt made a difference that Olesm had never learned any of the basic strategies that Erin had built her knowledge of chess on. That was part of the reason she could still wipe the floor with him and anyone else, although Olesm was probably the best. And it explained why she hadn’t seen him. She’d actually\nforgotten\nabout him—\n“Erin.\nErin!\n”\nOlesm was pulling at Erin’s hand. She snapped out of her thoughts and saw the Drake’s blue scales had turned pale.\n“What is it?”\n“There’s a sk-skeleton!”\nHe pointed, and his claw shook at Toren as the skeleton brought another plate of food out for Calruz. Erin stared blankly at Toren.\n“Yeah. That’s Toren.”\n“Toren? It has a—what’s a skeleton doing\nhere?\nDid that [Necromancer] summon it?”\nErin realized that Olesm hadn’t seen Toren before. She tried to explain. Olesm tried to listen. It was quite noisy in the common room.\n“What? And you\naccepted\nit? But the undead—they’re so—dangerous! Besides, one skeleton isn’t worth all the food you’ve been feeding Pisces!”\nErin’s eyes narrowed, and she tossed a glare over the room at Pisces. He was already trying to avoid Ceria’s gaze as the half-Elf occasionally stared at him, but he flinched away from Erin as well, although he couldn’t possibly have known what she and Olesm were talking about.\n“Oh really?”\nOlesm nodded. He tore into the food Toren brought for him, clearly famished.\n“Their binding spells don’t last that long. Your average skeleton falls to pieces within a day or two of being animated, and even if the necromancer uses an indefinite binding, their spell fails the instant they take too much damage. And they’re surprisingly fragile!”\n“Well, this one hasn’t fallen apart, and it’s been knocked to pieces once already.”\nOlesm frowned.\n“Really? That’s not usual. Most come apart instantly if you do that. This one might be made to reassemble? Most mages don’t spend nearly that much mana on a lowly skeleton.”\n“I think this one’s different. It’s smart enough to take orders and serve drinks for one thing.”\nThe Drake followed Toren’s circuit around the room and nodded slowly.\n“True. And that’s odd too. It’s very intelligent—can it play chess, by any chance?”\n“What?”\nErin grinned at Olesm and laughed.\n“Is that all you think about? You’re like me when I was a kid!”\nThe Drake blushed and ducked his head. Then he paused and looked around the room.\n“I didn’t think you would be so busy—I was hoping to play a game, but I wouldn’t want to take you away from your work. Where is that small Goblin or the Worker called Pawn?”\nErin’s smile faded. She’d nearly forgotten the events of yesterday as well.\n“I haven’t seen Rags and her crowd today. They must be doing Goblin-y things. But—the Workers probably won’t be coming for a while. There was an—incident with Pawn.”\nOlesm looked alarmed.\n“What happened?”\nSomeone was calling Erin’s name. She glanced around, distracted, and made a face.\n“Tell you later! Wait until everything slows down and then we can play a game of chess, okay?”\nReluctantly, Olesm nodded. He brightened as Erin brought him more food, though, and began attacking that. Erin walked over to the waving adventurer, and her endless quest for customer satisfaction continued.",

    "text": "Late. Later in the night. Erin was bone-tired, but she was still smiling and still, surprisingly, having fun. The adventurers weren’t jerks, and they liked her cooking. And they had money! It wasn’t bad to be working for once, and Erin wondered just how much money she’d make from tonight.\nNot a bad haul. But she\nwas\ntired. She paused, wiping at her forehead, and accepted a drink from Toren.\n“Hey, good job. You’re not doing so bad.”\nThe skeleton paused and nodded at her. She blinked in bemusement as it bustled out of the kitchen.\n“Skeletons. They think they’re as good as people.”\nShe laughed and walked back out. At last, the food requests had stopped coming in, and it was just filling glasses and doing the stacks of dirty dishes in the kitchen. Toren could do that. Erin would just fill up a bucket with water from the stream and boil it before she could sit down and play a game of chess with Olesm and maybe Pisces.\nShe had bucket in hand and was heading to the door when it opened. Two Workers immediately stepped inside. Erin raised a hand to greet them—\nAnd half of the adventurers in the room drew their weapons.\n“Whoa! Hey! Swords down!”\nErin shouted as the adventurers began pushing their chairs back and the Workers wavered. She put herself between the adventurers and the doorway.\n“These are my guests! Guests!”\n“Antinium!”\n“The Black Tide!”\nSome of the adventurers were shouting, but the adventuring captains were the first to get over their surprise. Gregor grabbed the shoulder of an adventurer that was rising and shoved him down in his seat.\n“Don’t fight!”\nThis came from Cervial. He raised his voice and shouted at the adventurers.\n“They’re part of Liscor! You hurt them, you make an enemy out of the city! They’re not here for a fight! These are the Worker-types.”\nErin ignored the shouting as the Captains began restoring order in the inn. She looked at the Workers, confused.\n“Why are you here? I thought you couldn’t leave the city.”\nNot without Pawn. But then Erin’s mind caught up with what she was saying.\n“Pawn?”\n“Yes, Innkeeper Solstice. But there is an issue—”\nThe Worker opened the doorway. Erin saw two other Workers helping another of their kind through the doorway. He was like them, exactly like them, but different.\nPawn.\nHe was okay. He was alive. Erin smiled as he stumbled into the inn. But then her smile froze.\nThe adventurers, who had been swearing and reacting to the presence of the Workers, took one look at Pawn and fell silent. Several sheathed weapons were unsheathed again. In the dead silence, someone swore loudly.\nPawn had to be helped by the two Workers into the inn. He swayed, unsteady. A trail of green blood followed him. Erin’s eyes were caught by the color. So green. So vibrant. A color she’d seen once on her hands before.\nThe Antinium named Pawn stared up at Erin. She stared back. Her thoughts had—stopped. She stared at him.\nHe was still Pawn. But he was missing one of his antennae, the one Ksmvr had severed. And he was missing arms as well. Three of them. And part of one leg.\nThe door closed, and the cold rain began to fall.\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "“I am individual. I am Antinium.”\nThat was the first whisper Erin heard out of Pawn. He sat, no longer bleeding, in the inn as she wrapped a bandage around his severed stumps.\nThe healing potions the adventurers had used had stopped the bleeding, but there was no way to restore lost limbs. And his severed wounds were still exposed to the air. The Antinium didn’t have skin but exoskeleton. So the bleeding wounds closed…slowly, the chitin creeping over bloody insides.\nHe whispered to Erin as she sat next to him. The half-Elf named Ceria and the other adventurers hovered around her or watched from their tables, silent spectators. But all of Erin’s attention was on the Antinium in front of her.\n“What happened?”\nHe trembled.\n“I was asked questions. I was tested. I passed.”\nErin looked at his broken body. Three arms had been cut away. And part of his foot—his carapace was cracked in multiple places and cut in others.\nTorture.\n“Is he coming after you? Ksmvr?”\nThe name made Pawn freeze like a—a cockroach caught in the light. He began shaking so uncontrollably the two Workers had to hold him so Erin could finish wrapping the bandage.\n“He—the Prognugator let me go. He let me go. I am individual.\nNot\nAberration. He let me go.”\nPawn repeated the words several times, rocking back and forth. Erin stared at him. She didn’t know what to\ndo\n.\n“Erin—”\nShe looked around. Ceria was staring at the Antinium.\n“Who is this?”\n“Pawn. This is Pawn. He’s a Worker.”\n“No.”\nAll four Workers said the word as one. Erin looked at them. They spoke in unison.\n“The individual known as Pawn is no longer a Worker.”\n“Then what\nis\nhe?”\n“Individual. Antinium. Not Aberration.”\nThey said it as if it meant something, but Erin couldn’t focus. All she heard was a buzzing in her head. Pawn was…\nCeria looked at Erin.\n“This has something to do with the Antinium in the city, right? Did they have a—a fight? I’ve heard of Prognugators. If this Ksmvr is after your friend—”\n“No.\nNo!\n”\nPawn waved his one good arm wildly. Again, the other Workers had to restrain him.\n“I am not Aberration. I am not. I am—”\nHe was incoherent, or as close to it as Erin had ever seen one of the Antinium. She stared at him. He was still shaking. And if he had the means, Erin was sure he would have wept. Instead, all he could do was tremble.\nIt was curious. Erin felt as though in this moment, she should be full of—something. Rage perhaps, or grief. But instead, there was nothing. Just a few thoughts.\nPawn was still babbling. He kept repeating his innocence as the other adventurers watched helplessly. Some of them looked disgusted, others actually sympathetic. And some were simply silent because it wasn’t the time to speak.\nErin had no time for them. Instead, she walked slowly over to a table. Olesm was paralyzed in his seat. He stared up at her, eyes wide. But Erin didn’t speak to him. Instead, she picked up what was in front of the Drake.\nA chessboard.\nCeria blinked as Erin carried it back. But Pawn’s eyes latched onto the simple wooden board as Erin put it on the table in front of him. Pawn looked up into her eyes, and she felt the nothingness in her deepen.\nSlowly, the two Workers propped Pawn up, and he moved so he could access the board with his remaining arm. The former Worker hesitated and then moved.\nHe shook like a leaf in the breeze. Pawn fumbled at the chess pieces with his single arm, clumsily trying to set them up and knocking them over. Trembling.\nErin stared at the Antinium and felt not a trace of fury in her. Not black fury, not burning rage nor wrath enough to power a thousand suns. Nothing.\nHer hands were calm as she took Pawn’s pieces and set them up on the board. Carefully, she arranged his pieces and hers. He was white—she was black. He clumsily moved a pawn forwards, and she replied.\nQueen’s Gambit. Dutch Defense. Erin crushed Pawn in only a few moves. Ruthlessly. Without guilt or hesitation.\nThe Antinium wavered. She felt and saw him hesitate and saw the other Workers around him staring. But then she reset the board, and he moved again.\nKing’s Pawn Game. French Defense. Erin played exactly the opposite game Pawn expected to, staying defensive and picking off his pieces slowly. She won again overwhelmingly.\nNothing. No feeling. Erin played in a void of calm, playing her best against a broken Pawn who could barely move his pieces. She reset the board, and they played.\nAgain, and again. Glacial silence, forest silence. The silence of endless days on the open desert where the winds devoured all and the sand was the only thing that ever changed. The silence of the open ocean on a sunny day—vast and loud, engulfing all things and making the world a green-blue landscape.\nThe silence of eternity, played out in the soft clicking of chess pieces on the board.\nAgain, Pawn played and Erin won. She rotated the board and made the first move. She won again.\nHe was alone. Alone, and not half the player she was. But with every game, something that had been cut away came back. Slowly, the Antinium’s trembling stopped.\nHe played. He lost. Erin felt nothing. But each game was a small slice of eternity cut and drifting between the two, a moment of healing, a moment of concentration and silence.\nAn [Immortal Moment].\nAnd when it was done, when the games had finished and the sun had fallen and then night had turned back into day, Erin stopped. She let Pawn gently push over his king. The Antinium no longer trembled, and she sat in a silent ring of Workers, Goblins, and even adventurers who sat watching the game. A single skeleton hovered with a platter of food in hand, watching with eyes that had seen forever in death and saw forever caught in a single game of chess.\nAnd still, Erin felt nothing. Not a flicker of pain, anger, or sadness crossed her heart. The emotions were too big for her. But whatever was in her prompted her. Erin felt it move, like the way the tide changed. A vast, deep feeling.\nShe spoke as Pawn hung his head low, drowsy with sleep.\n“Ksmvr.”\nThe single word brought the Antinium out of his half-sleep, shuddering. But he was strong enough to hear the name now, strong enough to listen and not weep. Erin met Pawn’s eyes and saw a person staring through an insect’s multifaceted gaze.\nShe made no promises, spoke no untrue words. Erin reached out and held the cold insect Worker, hugging him gently. Then she stood up and said two words.\n“I’m sorry.”\nThe door closed softly behind Erin. For a moment, all the adventurers stared, still caught in a fragment of forever. Then the silence was broken by shock and cursing as half the adventurers in the inn rushed out after her.",

    "text": "“Erin!”\nCeria was the first out of the inn. She was no warrior, but her heritage gave her grace and speed. And she wasn’t weighed down by armor.\nThe half-Elf ran into the rainy night and found the other girl was already gone. The door opened, and Yvlon and Cervial were outside right behind Ceria.\n“Where did she go?”\n“Towards the city, obviously. But she must be moving\nfast\n. I can’t even see her from here.”\n“Well, let’s get after her! If she’s trying to pick a fight—”\n“\nHumans\n.”\nCeria snapped the word, more as a general curse on the situation than an attack on Erin. She looked at Yvlon.\n“I can go, but that Antinium needs watching. And I’ve got no movement Skills. Can you—?”\n“Of course. You stop Calruz.”\n“Right. And if she gets there first, don’t fight the one called Ksmvr. Attacking him is the same as attacking the Hive.”\nCervial nodded. He looked around, seeing through the dark night better than even Ceria could.\n“Let’s go.\nI\ncan’t see her. The girl must have some kind of running Skill.”\nWithout a word, the two captains ran towards the city, moving like a blur. Ceria watched them go and then turned. She saw other adventurers standing just outside, caught in indecision.\n“If you want to go, go. But only drag that innkeeper back. Fighting here would be a mistake. But it would be better if less people were out in the darkness. We don’t know what kind of monsters live here.”\nAt her words, most of the adventurers went back into the inn. Or tried to. They had to retreat as a large shape pushed his way through the crowd.\nCalruz emerged from the inn, face dark with anger. None of the Humans wanted to get in his way, but Ceria stood in front of the Minotaur’s path.\n“Where do you think you’re going?”\n“After the innkeeper. Where else?”\n“Yvlon and Cervial are already after her. You wouldn’t be able to catch her anyways.”\nCalruz grunted.\n“Who says I’m going to catch her? The child needs a second for a proper death duel.”\n“You will\nnot\ngo. If we cause a disturbance—”\n“Honor is at stake. You will not stop me.”\nCeria felt a massive hand move her aside. She thought about the few spells she could use and then abandoned the idea when she saw the look on Calruz’s face. She stared helplessly as the Minotaur strode off in the direction of the city.\n“The other two might be able to stop him. If they get to the innkeeper in time.”\nGerial said it loudly behind Ceria. She had to raise her voice above the pounding rain. She was already soaked, but at least her enchanted robes weren’t getting soggy with water.\n“I just hope she doesn’t actually try to fight that Antinium—or whoever he is. She’s no warrior.”\n“No.”\nThe two leading members of the Horns of Hammerad stared at each other. They both felt it. The hint of déjà vu.\n“If you want to go—”\n“No. Calruz won’t listen to me anymore than you. And if he does pick a fight, better it’s only him. Besides—”\n“Besides what?”\nGerial stared out into the rain, hand clenched.\n“If I went out there, I don’t think I could stop myself.”\nCeria followed his gaze. The night was dark and stormy. She spoke distantly.\n“That’s not what I’m worried about.”\n“What?”\n“It’s night. And—the timing of it.”\nCeria paused. Gerial stared at her. They trusted each other, and adventurers learned to listen to their feelings. Ceria hit on what her instincts were telling her and spoke.\n“It feels like a trap.”",

    "text": "Ksmvr stood on a hilltop, waiting. He was not within the boundaries of Liscor. It was important that he was not.\nBoundaries. Rules. Ksmvr understood them. They were important. Rules and order made up the Hive, and by such things could everything be understood.\nPacts had been made. The Soldiers of the Hive were not permitted above-ground save for times of emergency—or war. And while the definition of emergency could allow for numerous occasions, bringing the Soldiers above ground would bring about questions regardless. And the Queen was not to be disturbed.\nBut no such pacts had been established outside of the city. Therefore, four of the Soldier Antinium stood silently next to Ksmvr, silent giants waiting for his order. They were elite—perhaps not as strong individually as he was, but close. Together, they were more than enough to subdue a single [Innkeeper].\nIt might have been overkill to a Human, but the Antinium took no chances. And Erin Solstice had established her worth. Initially, Ksmvr had only known what his Queen had told him, and from that, he had thought of her as insignificant. Worthless.\nBut—and here was the difficult part—Erin Solstice\nwas\nimportant. She was valuable. Perhaps unique. His Queen had been wrong in her appraisal of Erin, and that bothered Ksmvr greatly.\nBut the duty of a Prognugator was to protect and serve the Hive. Ksmvr would do just that. He waited for Erin Solstice in the certainty that she would come.\nHer actions were a matter of record. More than that, the established thought processes of Humans were well known to Ksmvr. She would come in fury and vengeance to be caught, and the individual known as Pawn would be easily retrieved. Minor obstacles like the Goblins, adventurers, and skeleton were of no object.\nKsmvr shifted in his position on the hilltop that afforded him a view of the area surrounding the city. He was not bored. He was incapable of being bored. But the time he had spent waiting bothered him.\nThe Soldiers behind Ksmvr did not move. They waited, alert for any threat. They did not get bored either.\nBut Relc was quite bored. The Drake yawned, and all five Antinium turned. Ksmvr’s swords and daggers sprang from their sheaths, and the Soldiers immediately raised their club-like hands.\n“Hold it.”\nRelc sat up in the grass, appearing out of the dark landscape as if by magic. It wasn’t magic of course. But mud and the Drake’s dark scales had made him practically invisible in the grass.\nKsmvr held up a hand and sent a mental order to the Soldiers. But neither he nor the other Antinium relaxed. He kept his swords pointed at the ground.\n“Senior Guardsman Relc. Do you have business with me at this time? If so, I request it wait until tomorrow.”\nRelc scratched at the back of his head. He looked at Ksmvr and glanced away.\n“What? Oh, no, no. I don’t have business with\nyou\n.”\nKsmvr waited, but Relc didn’t say anything else. More questioning was in order.\n“May I inquire as to your purpose here?”\n“Sure, inquire away.”\nMore silence. Ksmvr was aware that Relc was being deliberately obstinate and confrontational. A troubling complication.\n“Why have you followed my group?”\nRelc raised what would have been an eyebrow.\n“I’m not following—”\n“Please refrain from lying. There is no other reason for you to be out here at this time of night. Moreover, you are not currently on duty. Why are you here?”\nThe Soldier Antinium shifted slightly. Relc eyed them, unimpressed. He flicked his tongue out and shrugged.\n“\nI’m\njust taking a walk. And, uh, a nap. In the rain. Which I do quite often.”\nTalking to people—or rather, interacting with those not of the Hive was difficult. And Ksmvr was unused to conversations with outsiders in the first place. Still, he persisted, keeping one eye on the dark landscape the entire time.\n“Will you return to the city then?”\n“Maybe. In time. I’m just enjoying myself.”\n“I see. And will you continue to remain here so long as we are here?”\n“Oh, no. I’ll leave pretty soon. Just as soon as a certain stupid Human girl gets back to her inn all safe and sound.”\nKsmvr interpreted that information, and the Soldiers around him raised their hands. Relc waved at them with his tail.\n“Stop that. I’m not here for a fight. And neither are you, since I’d win.”\nIt was an accurate statement, at least in that the chances of Relc’s victory were higher than Ksmvr’s. And a deeply complicating factor. Therefore, Ksmvr attempted a higher degree of diplomacy than before.\n“Your presence is unneeded. If Erin Solstice cooperates, she will be unharmed.”\n“Yeah, but I don’t think she will. Do you? And frankly, even if you plan to feed her with a golden spoon, I don’t think I should let you take her.”\n“Erin Solstice is not a citizen of Liscor. Your duty does not extend to—”\n“Would you shut up?”\nRelc said it pleasantly, but with an edge that made Ksmvr consider silence the most appropriate response. The Drake shook his head.\n“You sound just like Klb back—well, back when I first met him. I don’t like that. So shut up and listen since I have to spell it out. Here’s what’s going to happen tonight. Erin Solstice is going to run into the city, probably with that stupid frying pan, and\nnot\nfind you and a bunch of your big Antinium friends. She’s going to go back to her inn all safe and nice.”\n“You are protecting her.”\n“I guess.”\n“Why?”\nRelc paused.\n“I like her. Well—I used to. Now, I think she’s a bloody idiot Human like the others. But at least she makes good pasta. And—well, let’s call it a favor. Klbkch died protecting her. I just figured it would be a shame if all his effort went to waste.”\nThere was an inconsistency in Relc’s statements, and Ksmvr leapt on it, sure of his success.\n“Klbkch was a member of the Hive. By obstructing my work, you obstruct the Hive.”\nStrangely, Relc did not respond to this logical inconsistency like Ksmvr had predicted. He just shrugged.\n“Yeah. But I don’t like you.”\nDealing with non-Antinium was so—so\nfrustrating\n. Ksmvr felt an unexplored emotion within him. Troubling. But he persisted.\n“I am Prognugator of the Free Antinium of Liscor. My authority—”\n“Shut up.”\nAnother tack.\n“I have four Soldiers with me.”\nRelc yawned. He eyed the silent Antinium, whose hands were literal weapons. Their carapaces were equivalent to unenchanted plate armor, and they possessed numerous abilities inherent to the Antinium that other species did not have. Even so, Relc did not appear intimidated.\n“I’ve heard that a newly grown soldier is the equivalent of a Level 15 [Warrior] for most species. Interesting. But if you think those guys frighten me, I’ll rip a few of their heads off for you. The Antinium never attacked Liscor in the second war, so you have no idea how strong I am.”\nKsmvr paused and tilted his head as he accessed the required memory.\n“Relc Grasstongue, former sergeant of the 1st Wing of the Liscorian army. Currently Level 33 in the [Spearmaster] class and Level 12 in the [Guardsman] class. Negligible levels in the [Archer] class as well as the [Carpenter] class. Possesses mainly combat skills as well as the rare skill [Triple Thrust].”\n“…Damn bugs. Did Klbkch tell you that?”\nAt last. Dialogue. Ksmvr did not have the facial muscles—or face—to smile, but a part of him felt relieved. He attempted to continue the conversation.\n“Klbkch estimated that, if necessary, he would be able to hold you off for five minutes and inflict serious wounds before death. If given the order to terminate, he predicted a sneak attack had an even chance of killing you.”\nThe look Relc gave Ksmvr did not indicate a positive reaction to the conversation.\n“I really don’t like you, you know.”\n“Your regard for me matters little. My position is temporary.”\n“Good for you, I guess. Why are you talking so much, anyways?”\n“I am attempting to build the same level of camaraderie shared between you and former Prognugator Klbkch.”\nAnother pause, and this time, Relc’s expression darkened. He uncrossed his arms and took a step back as if the words had been a threat—which they were not. For some reason, his face looked troubled. Socialization—difficult, as Ksmvr had repeatedly observed. So many unclear variables.\n“Well. I—no. I’m going to stand over here until Erin comes by.”\nHe began to walk off. Ksmvr called out after him.\n“Sixteen more Soldiers are currently moving towards this location. You will not be able to stop them alone.”\nRelc paused. Ksmvr couldn’t see—but the Drake looked like he was grinning.\n“That’s sort of funny. I guess not all of you Antinium are alike, huh?”\n“What leads you to that conclusion?”\n“You don’t have [Dangersense]. You’d better pray you get it, or another skill like it, soon.”\nRelc nodded towards a distant hill. Ksmvr looked and mentally ordered the Soldiers leaving the Hive to hold position. Perhaps if he were Human, he might never have seen the silent figure crouching and smiling down at the two warriors. But he was Antinium, and he recognized Gazi on sight.\nThe Drake sat down on the hill casually, ignoring the other Antinium still watching him. He nodded towards Gazi’s distant figure.\n“Now\nshe\ncould eat you and your cute little soldiers for breakfast. Me, she’d probably choke on the way down.”\nKsmvr was capable of free-thought, a mark of his position and importance to the Hive. He was a leader, meant to direct soldiers and deal with unexpected situations as they arose. Never mind that he had become Prognugator before his training period was over—he was trusted by the Queen. But—but—\nBut no matter how hard he thought, he couldn’t decide what to do. Erin Solstice was important. But with the presence of Gazi the Omniscient as well as Relc, suddenly the costs of capturing Erin Solstice became too high.\nBut she was important. But it was too costly. But she was important. But it was too costly. What should he do? His Queen had ordered him not to disturb her. But he knew the importance of Individuals. His entire duty—the entire duty of the Antinium within Liscor revolved around the importance of this. But it was too dangerous.\nWhat should he do? For the first time in his short life, Ksmvr had no idea what he should do.",

    "text": "It was a silent—well, stalemate wasn’t the word. From their position within a deep section of the grass, the other watchers could see that the Antinium were in trouble. Even as they watched, their leader came to a decision. He spoke a few words to Relc, and the Antinium surrounding him began marching back to the city.\nThat was good.\n“There. It is well that we did not have to intervene, yes?”\nKrshia spoke her comment quietly, but even with the pouring rain, the other Gnolls lying in the grass heard her perfectly. Tkrn and six of the other Gnolls relaxed their hold on their bows. Tkrn nodded at Ksmvr as the Antinium swiftly descended the hill, flanked by his Soldiers.\n“It might be best to slay the bug before he returns to the city, yes? It would not be too difficult to do, especially if he intends to hurt this Erin Solstice.”\n“Fool.”\nTkrn barely saw the paw that cuffed him on the head. Krshia glared at him between the long stalks of grass.\n“He was not trying to kill her. Use your brain, you fool, you.”\nThe other Gnolls chuckled in amusement as Tkrn flattened his ears in embarrassment. As the most junior member of the Gnolls—and the most inexperienced—it was even more humiliating to make a mistake in front of their leader.\n“But he had\nSoldiers\n.”\nKrshia snorted.\n“Yes, to capture her. But he was waiting for Erin Solstice to arrive, yes? That is suspicious. Who waits for a challenge? Only Humans in their pride and Drakes do that, yes? We fight without needing large open spaces and people to watch. But the Antinium—they are even more different than we.”\nShe nodded at Ksmvr as the Antinium marched back across the flatlands. The Antinium was alert—constantly scanning the landscape. But despite the Antinium’s impressive dark vision, they were no hunters of the plains. Krshia and the other Gnolls were perfectly hidden in their cover.\n“If he—Ksmvr—wanted Erin Solstice dead, then dead she would be already. He would stab her before she saw him, yes? But he wanted her here and had many Soldiers with him. Another thing. It is a violation of the treaty to let them out of the Hive unless the city is in danger. Maybe this one is no Klbkch. What am I saying? He\nis\nno Klbkch, but it is extraordinary all the same.”\nShe shook her head.\n“Someone\nelse\nwants Erin Solstice. And excluding the foolish Drake, three different sides came for her tonight.”\n“It seems you are right. This Erin Solstice, she is important.”\nAnother Gnoll made that comment, and the others nodded. If they had doubted Krshia before—and if they had, they were wise enough to never have said it in her presence—tonight changed that. She glared at them.\n“I said it, did I not? But it is poor fortune that it is known. We must hurry.”\nThe other Gnolls nodded. One spoke.\n“The other warriors will arrive soon. Within the week.”\n“Good.”\nTkrn shifted. He eyed the hill where the silent figure of Gazi was still crouching and engaging in a staring contest with Relc.\n“Should we leave, then? Or will Gazi do something?”\nThe other Gnolls muttered. They knew the odds of taking on a Named Adventurer. Krshia shook her head.\n“I do not think so. She is crafty, and she is waiting. I do not think she would have intervened unless all others failed, including we.”\n“But she is still here, yes.”\n“Yes.”\nKrshia scowled up at Gazi. It was impossible—they were perfectly hidden, but the half-Gazer’s eye flicked away from Relc and towards them for the merest fraction of a second. Krshia muttered something as the other Gnolls growled.\n“She likes to watch.”\n“Well, she can’t do anything to us even if she knows we’re here.”\nThis time, Tkrn received several admonitory paws to the back of the head. Krshia shook herself and sent water drops flying now that their cover had been broken.\n“Maybe not. But it is an ill thing to be spotted. We will wait to make sure she does nothing. Just in case.”\nThe Gnolls sat up in the grass, relaxing. Relc still hadn’t spotted them, but then, the Drake only relied on his Skills. And the problem with [Dangersense] is that it only told him when there was potential threat.\nThey meant him no harm. They were on the same side, at least for the night. So the Gnolls waited. The half-Gazer sat patiently, and the Drake ripped up pieces of grass. The night was silent.\nThey waited.\nAnd waited.\nAnd…\nFrom their position in the grass, the Gnolls saw Relc shift and scratch irritably at his scales. He looked around and then voiced the question on everyone’s mind.\n“Where\nis\nshe?”",

    "text": "“We couldn’t find her.”\nCeria stared in disbelief at Yvlon and Cervial as the two adventurers returned, panting. They’d run all the way to Liscor and back in less than thirty minutes.\n“What?”\n“We got to the gates, but the guard there said no one had come by.”\nBoth of the adventurers shrugged helplessly. Ceria chewed at her lip.\n“Maybe she got lost?”\n“I doubt it.”\n“Then a monster—”\n“We would have noticed that.”\n“Then where\nis\nshe?”\n“I don’t know. Did you spot Calruz by any chance?”\nCervial smiled crookedly.\n“Yeah. He tried to get into the city, but the guard told him the gates were closed. He’s stomping his way back now.”\nWell, that was one problem solved. But the bigger problem remained. Where was Erin Solstice? Ceria stared around, but the night was still full of rain and seeing was impossible.\n“Well, we’ll just have to wait. Come on inside—the skeleton is mad as hell, but it’s staying put for some reason. I guess we should as well.”\nYvlon and Cervial trooped back into the inn. Ceria looked around one last time. It was so strange. She’d assumed—\nSomething\ndropped from the roof of the inn and landed right next to Ceria. The half-Elf yelped, grabbed for her wand, and stopped.\nErin got up from the ground, wincing at the bad fall. She brushed mud off her shirt and paused as she saw Ceria.\n“Oh. Hi.”\nCeria clutched at her heart. It felt as if it had\nstopped\n.\n“What are you—where were you?”\nErin blinked at her. She pointed up.\n“I was on the roof.”\nCeria stared up. The roof.\n“…Doing\nwhat?\n”\nErin shrugged. She wiped at her face. It didn’t do much in the rain.\n“I was crying. What did you think I was doing?”\nHer eyes were red. Ceria could see that perfectly. She replied lamely.\n“We—we thought you were going after Ksmvr.”\n“Why would I do that?”\nAgain, Ceria had to stop. She grappled with words.\n“Well, after what he did to your friend—I’d say everyone in the inn would have joined you. Calruz especially.”\n“Really. Really?”\nErin snuffled again and wiped at her nose.\n“That’s nice of you. I guess. You could all hold him down while I bashed his brains out with a frying pan, right?”\n“We wouldn’t do that. Calruz—thought you were going to duel him.”\n“And kill him?”\nErin looked at Ceria. It was an odd stare. Accusatory. Hurt. Ceria shifted, suddenly awkward.\n“But what he did—”\n“Evil.”\nErin said it flatly.\n“Pawn was innocent. He didn’t deserve that. When I saw what that bastard did—”\n“Yeah. So we thought—”\nCeria trailed off lamely. Erin was still staring at her. As if it were the most obvious thing in the world, she shook her head.\n“He hurt Pawn. But does that mean I should go out there and beat him to death? How? He’s a warrior, and I’m—I’m an innkeeper. And I don’t murder people. I kill monsters, and I’ve killed in self-defense. But I don’t murder people. Ever.”\nIt was too hard to meet the girl’s eyes. Ceria looked away. It felt like she was speaking to someone strange. Something—\nShe had never needed to use the word ‘alien’ in the common tongue. The closest words Ceria knew were\noutsider\n,\nstrange, unnatural,\nand yes, sometimes other species could surprise her, like Selphids\n.\nBut in this moment, she truly did feel like ‘alien’ fit, genuinely and without bias.\nSomeone completely alien to Ceria’s understanding of the world.\nErin was staring at her, a hint of accusation in her stare. And it was hard to bear. There was something innocent in her gaze, something that Ceria had lost long ago when she first stared into a dead man’s eyes.\n“I’m sorry. I just assumed—”\nErin shrugged. She paused and stared around at the dark landscape. Ceria saw her lips move.\n“Can I tell you something? Something sort of offensive?”\n“Sure.”\nErin stared at the ground and the wet grass. Her breath appeared in the cold air.\n“You guys have a really shitty world. A really bad one.”\n“We do…?”\n“I don’t like it. It’s so wonderful at times—so beautiful and full of magic. But then this happens. Every time. Well. Almost every time. I hate it.”\nCeria had nothing to say to that.\n“For a moment, I wanted to kill Ksmvr too. But I would die if I tried that, right? He’s fast. Strong. A warrior. Maybe I could kill him. But then what?”\n“He’d be dead.”\n“And so would Pawn. Probably. That Queen would send her Soldiers to rip off his head and mine.”\n“I understand. You made the right choice.”\nErin shivered.\n“Did I? It seems like all I can do at times like this is just accept what happened and move on.”\nShe shivered. Ceria was conscious of how cold it was. The enchantments on her robes made her feel warm even in the freezing rain, but the Human girl had sat up on the rooftop for—it had to be an hour at least.\n“You should come inside. I’m sure Pawn will want to see you.”\nShe reached out for Erin. The girl’s skin was deathly cold. She muttered something.\n“…know.”\n“What?”\nErin shook her head.\n“I don’t know. I don’t know what to do to\nstop\nit. But I do know what to do.”\nShe walked past Ceria, into the inn. The half-Elf followed, watching. There was something in the Human girl’s eyes.\nPawn half-rose in his seat when he saw her. Anxiety was written all over his face, although only Erin could see it. She smiled at him and sneezed.\nThe other adventurers stared at Erin. She ignored them. They were not important. Instead, she sat down as Toren rushed towards her with a towel. She patted the cold water off her and felt a bit more alive when he gave her a steaming mug of boiled water.\nOlesm had been playing Pawn. But the Drake instantly stood to give her his seat. Erin shook her head.\n“Go on. Keep playing.”\nThe Drake blinked at her and then awkwardly sat down. Erin sat next to Pawn. At first, the Antinium looked at her, but she smiled. It was very quiet in the room. After a while, Olesm coughed and awkwardly moved a piece forward.\nPawn played. The two played. Erin looked at the Workers and got them a chess set. It was strange. The Workers sat and began playing. The adventurers sat awkwardly. After a while, Erin had Toren bring out some leftovers.\nAnd it was still silent. So when the feeling in Erin couldn’t be contained, she opened her mouth.\nAnd began to sing.\nIt caught Pawn off-guard. He froze as he held a knight in his hand and stared at Erin. So did everyone else. But the awkwardness—the fear she might have felt was nothing. So Erin sang.\nShe had never been good at singing. Or rather, she’d never been as good at singing as she had at playing chess. But when she was a kid, before she’d quit going to church, she’d been part of the choir. She’d sung in the school choir, and once, just once, her teacher had encouraged her to study singing.\nBut she hadn’t. Erin had played chess and forgotten how to breathe properly, stopped singing every week. But the music had lingered, and she’d never really forgotten how.\n“\nI don’t know why you hurt inside or what was said to make you cry…\n”\nShe didn’t know why she started with a Lady Gaga song. But that one she’d always loved because it made her feel better. And\nGreatest\nwas probably her greatest song.\nErin had no piano. No voice synthesizer, no backup choir; she didn’t even have a microphone. But she didn’t need those things.\nHer voice filled up the room, and it seemed to her audience that even though only one person was singing, they could hear something else. The same song Erin had heard first while sitting in her room playing chess.\nWas it one person singing or two? They heard another voice. Strange drums—the sound of a piano—a voice singing with electronic sound in ways they could never have imagined.\nCeria listened and heard another voice and a kind of music she’d never heard of wherever she’d gone. She closed her eyes and thought of a girl who knew colors that Ceria had never seen in her life.\nOlesm was playing. Pawn kept moving pieces, but that was a backdrop to the music. Erin finished her song, and silence beat down again. It was oppressive, so she chose another song.\nThe adventurers had never heard a ukulele played before. But even though Erin wasn’t playing one, they heard it now. And in her voice—a man’s voice. Singing.\n“\nSomewhere over the rainbow way up high\n…”\nShe’d always loved Israel Kamakawiwoʻole’s version of that song more than the Judy Garland one. And she’d loved both with all her heart.\nThe song was lighter, happier in a way, but in another way—not. Someone was crying. Erin kept singing, conjuring a piece of something the people in her inn had never heard before. A piece of immortal music.\nAnother immortal moment.\nAnd then, of course, she kept singing. Somewhere, Erin started singing\nHallelujah\nand smiled as she remembered watching Shrek for the first time. The music poured out of her as Pawn played a game of chess, pausing to stare at her.\nThe other adventurers were silent. Ceria listened in silence. She was half-Elf. Half of her had grown up knowing the fragments of forever—but the other half was still in awe.\nBut the Humans listened to something that was not part of their world. They listened as Erin sang to their hearts.\n“\nI have died everyday, waiting for you. Darling, don’t be afraid, I have loved you for a thousand years…\n”\nGerial wept into his mustache. The adventurers sat in silence. Yvlon closed her eyes, and Cervial kept rubbing at his.\nA moment of eternity. A song. A fragment of the past. A memory.\nImmortality brought to life with every verse.",

    "text": "She taught them one song.\nHere I Am Lord\n, a song from church. It mattered. It was important. And when she sang it, Pawn looked up.\nFirst, Erin sang.\n“\nI, the Lord of Sea and Sky. I have heard my people cry. All who dwell in dark and sin, my hand will save.\n”\nErin sang with Ceria, two soft voices singing as the half-Elf joined in.\n“\nHere I am, Lord. Is it I, Lord? I have heard You calling in the night.\n”\nAnd then the others joined in. Men and women, singing a song for a god this world had never known. By the end of the third verse, all the Humans were singing. Calruz leaned against the doorway, frowning, closing his eyes and listening, silent. Pawn listened as Erin sang, leaning against him, warming him.\n“\nI will hold Your people in my heart.\n”\nHe shuddered then. And then when she looked at him, he did not cry. The Antinium do not weep. But she still saw the tears in his soul.\nAnd the night passed to day, and Erin sang on. Small songs, grand songs. And the magic was with her, fading with every note. Until she simply sang and the moment was no longer forever. But it was enough. When Erin finally closed her eyes, the inn was silent.\nAnd though the Antinium didn’t smile, she did. For him. For the both of them. Not a smile to say everything was fine. Not to hide the pain, but a smile in spite of the bleeding. As brave as the little Worker who clung to her as she sang him to his rest. Then, and only then, did she let him go, slumbering, and go to the kitchen and lie down.\nErin closed her eyes and slept.\n[Innkeeper Level 15!]\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "On the first day, she saw the Goblins. It was as she ran through the grasslands around Liscor, the Flood Plains, which were a barrier to armies and passage in the spring and empty in the short winter on this continent.\nShe stopped when she crested the hill and saw them fighting in the small valley below. Ryoka immediately crouched low to avoid their attention. A tribe of Goblins could be outrun, but their bows and slings were still a threat.\nBesides, Ryoka couldn’t run as fast. Not today.\nHer fire was gone.\nThis wasn’t a single tribe in the valley below. It was two. And they were fighting. Shrill screams and warcries floated up to where Ryoka hid in the grass. She could see—yes, one of the groups of Goblins was wearing feathers. Some kind of ornamentation.\nThey were led by a large Goblin—one nearly twice the size of his friends. Still shorter than Ryoka, but heavyset and thick. He had rusted armor patched together on his chest and an axe in one hand. Probably their chieftain.\nIt was hard to tell where the other Goblins’ chieftain was. There was no Goblin that stood out as particularly bigger than the rest, but this tribe—the defending one—seemed more coordinated than the feathered tribe.\nThey were holding the other group of Goblins back with a stiff line of clubs and daggers, and their archers and sling-using Goblins were firing over the backs of their friends. It almost looked like an infantry line.\nAnd even as Ryoka watched, another group of Goblins suddenly emerged from the grass and plowed into the right flank of the enemy. The attacking Goblins faltered and reacted slowly as this new group began cutting a line through their foes.\nThe surprise attack group was comprised of the largest Goblins and the best equipped. A group of heavy infantry? But Goblins didn’t work like that. Except that these ones did. They were organized. They didn’t break ranks as they attacked the other Goblins. They kept in formation and guarded each other’s backs, and the difference showed as they kept gaining ground.\nOne of these strange Goblins carried a sword and shield that seemed to shine in her hands. They flashed and glowed as she struck and blocked, killing other Goblins, leading the attack. It was a trick of the light. She was tiny—small even for her kind—but she was leading the strange Goblins, Ryoka could tell. The entire battle was coalescing around her, and she was making straight for the enemy chieftain.\nHe was holding the line as his tribe fell back around him. He roared and raised his axe as the small Goblin approached with a bodyguard of her own. With one blow, he split the head of the Goblin that charged him and struck at the tiny Goblin.\nShe retreated. He charged towards her, swinging wildly, but she raised her shield and gave ground. Ryoka frowned. The Goblin’s mouth was open, and she looked like she was saying something. And her finger was—glowing?\nA flash of light blinded Ryoka for a second. She blinked, rubbing at her eyes. When she could see again, the Goblin chieftain was rolling on the ground, screaming.\nHe was on fire. And the Goblins around him were being chased by—fire? Yes. It was some kind of spell. It looked like a flickering bird or perhaps fiery insect that landed on its foes and set them alight. The small Goblin had conjured it out of the air.\nThat was too much. Their leader dead and surrounded by the enemy, the defending Goblins fled or fell to the ground, cowering. Ryoka saw the small Goblin begin rallying her side, pointing to the wounded and shouting orders, staring around at the Goblin who’d run up to her. Turning. Pointing at—\nRyoka blinked. Then her heart began to race. The tiny Goblin was pointing directly at\nher\n. How did she know Ryoka was there?\nRyoka stood up. She looked around and only now saw the Goblin sitting on the other hill. A sentry? Goblins using scouts?\nHe shouted, and all the Goblins stared at Ryoka. The sentry swung a sling, and the first rock barely missed Ryoka’s head.\nShe ran.\nThey followed.",

    "text": "She was faster. But her fire had gone out. And Ryoka was still tired. Still—she hadn’t slept. Not since then. She’d just kept running.\nSo she didn’t outdistance the Goblins quickly enough. That was why they were able to herd her. Different groups kept popping up, trying to ambush her, dashing ahead and pushing her towards the main horde.\nShe didn’t let them. But Ryoka didn’t know the hills and valleys. When she ran into a grove of strange trees, a team of slingers pelted her with stones, making her run left. And that’s when she saw the small Goblin.\nShe was surrounded by her elite bodyguard of large Goblins. But the small Goblin was the best-equipped out of all of them. She had the short sword and shield that seemed new. Pristine compared to the other equipment the Goblins were using.\nRyoka had to break through them. She raised her fist and decked the first Goblin that ran at her. Not hard enough to break his skull like last time. Not hard enough to kill.\nThe Goblins hadn’t been expecting that. Ryoka kicked out and took another one down. They hesitated, and the small Goblin screeched something. She ran forwards and slashed at Ryoka’s leg.\nShort. But quick. And her friends were too numerous. Ryoka retreated and sensed the other Goblins converging on her. She had to run.\nShe bull-rushed the Goblins to the right side, and they fell back. They were still afraid of her, for all they had a competent leader. She kicked, punched. And then as she was nearly free, something slashed at the rucksack at her back.\nRyoka spun, and the blade missed her by inches. The small Goblin. She’d been aiming for the straps on Ryoka’s pack. Clever.\nGoblins swarmed her. Ryoka cursed and kicked them away, throwing them down\nhard\n. They were trying to take her runner’s backpack. Steal her—\nShe shook herself like a dog, and the Goblins went flying. Ryoka’s hands flashed, and Goblins fell down.\nThe small Goblin blocked her way as Ryoka moved forwards again. She and another Goblin were the only things blocking Ryoka, but more of the tribe was screaming as they rushed towards her.\nThe girl crouched and kicked low. A Goblin took a hit to the groin and folded up silently. For a second, she and the small Goblin were alone. They locked eyes.\nThe small Goblin smiled. She raised a finger, and Ryoka didn’t hesitate. She lunged forwards and\nkicked\nthe small Goblin as hard as she could.\nHer bare foot met the cold impact of metal rather than flesh. The Goblin had managed to raise her shield, but Ryoka’s kick still catapulted her across the ground.\nShe didn’t see whether the Goblin was going to get up. Ryoka turned and sprinted away, dodging Goblins as they poured over the hill. She felt something graze her arm and then heat on her back—she juked left, and the fiery bird missed her. Ryoka kept running, and then they were behind her.",

The Goblins disappeared, giving up on her or having found a better quarry.\nRyoka ran on.\nShe had escaped with everything important. The ring Teriarch had given her—the letter—her money pouch—and she still had the potions strapped to her rucksack. She left the Goblins behind and ran on.\nShe had everything, right? Ryoka felt at her side as her legs pumped and the last Goblins slowed behind her. She thought she felt the smooth glass of the potion bottle and she didn’t have the time to check with them behind her still.\nAt least she had the wand. Ryoka felt the crystalline warmth from the core. She looked back—but there were so many Goblins, and she didn’t care. It was just a potion. Nothing mattered.\nRyoka ran.",

The grass was not safe.\nAnd the road was empty.\nBecause the land beyond Liscor was desolate for miles, even of bandits. Bandits preyed on travellers, and who would travel so far north? Better to take a ship. Or if travel had to be done, it was best done in a caravan armed to the teeth.\nThe road stretching south from Liscor ran down through the plains and branched into several paths that would lead to major cities, the Gnoll tribe lands, and even the coast. But to get there, every traveller had to pass through the Blood Fields.\nAnd they were death.\nRyoka knew this, and she ran on. The landscape changed under her feet. Grass became sparser, tougher, less pleasant to run on and more full of weeds. She stepped in a patch of something like nettles and had to stop.\nBy the light of the first campfire, Ryoka stared at her swollen foot and ankles.

    "text": "Ceria woke up first. It was an unconscious act on the part of her body that her mind wanted no part of. As the first rays of dawn hit her, she opened her eyes and sat up in her bed.\nIt was too early. And despite her early rising, Ceria was\nnot\na morning person.\nBut some things were too hard to forget. It had been years—decades, really—since Ceria had needed to wake up this early. She was safe in this inn, among her friends and companions. Safe.\nYet it was impossible to forget some things. Pisces had brought it out. It was his fault; his face made her remember better times. The academy and all that had gone wrong there. She…\nShe didn’t feel like attacking him.\nNot after—what, six years? But it still weighed on her and, she hoped, him too.\nRubbing her face with her hands, Ceria decided that she was up. Remembering the past would only lead to nightmares, and she wasn’t about to wake the inn screaming.\nSo despite the early hour and lack of sleep, Ceria stumbled downstairs. She blinked around at the room.\n“Dd.”\nShe’d meant to say ‘odd’, but her mouth wasn’t working. What was odd wasn’t that the common room of the inn was a mess—what was odd was that it was\nnot.\nLast night. Ceria rubbed at her eyes again and remembered. Music. A night that had lasted forever. Songs and—something else. Some instruments she’d never heard before and beautiful words.\nIt felt like a dream. But it had been real, so it felt even more dreamlike. She remembered stumbling up to bed as the other adventurers left, still caught in that magical moment.\nYes—they’d left, but adventurers always created messes wherever they went. Mostly in the form of dead monster corpses and blood, but in this case in the form of empty dishes, dirt, spilled food and drink, and coins scattered on the tables.\nNone of that was here now. The room was clean. In fact, in the morning light, the polished wood practically sparkled at Ceria.\nShe found that mildly offensive. But hunger was distracting her in no small way. She stumbled towards the kitchen—\nAnd froze as a skeleton blocked the doorway.\n“Wood rot.”\nThat was\ntwice\nnow that Ceria felt her heart was literally about to stop. She staggered backwards and pointed shakily at the skeleton.\n“Don’t—\ndo\nthat!”\nThe skeleton was silent. Ceria blinked at it, still not quite thinking properly. It had a name, didn’t it? Erin called it—\n“Toren, right?”\nThe skeleton made no reply. Well, it had probably been the one to clean up the room. Last Ceria had seen, the girl Erin Solstice had been sleeping next to the Antinium named Pawn.\nWho also wasn’t here.\nSomething about that made an alarm bell go off in Ceria’s head, but she was distracted by pressing needs and the undead monster in front of her.\n“Is your mistress up? I’d like some breakfast, but I can get it myself.”\nCeria went to move past the skeleton, but its arm shot out and blocked her way. She stopped and stared at it.\n“What are you—”\nIt put a finger to its yellowed teeth even as Ceria saw Erin rolled up in a blanket in the corner of the kitchen. She blinked at the girl.\n“That’s where she sleeps?”\nThe skeleton made no sound, but it seemed irked that Ceria was still making sound. The half-Elf shook her head. It was too early for this.\n“I’m hungry.”\nNo response. The skeleton stared at her.\n“I need food.”\nAgain, the pitiless cold flames of death were her only answer. Ceria tried to push the skeleton aside, but it grabbed her hand warningly. She eyed it. It looked—well, it was Pisces’ creation. Carefully, she withdrew her hand.\n“Fine. No waking her. But can you get me something to eat? Or—cook something?”\nThe skeleton seemed to consider this. After a moment, it reluctantly nodded and walked into the kitchen. Unlike the many skeletons Ceria had seen or killed, this one walked with something approaching grace. It was a superior version of an inferior undead creature, and there was only one mage stupid enough to create something like that.\nPisces.\nCeria narrowed her eyes at the skeleton as it trotted into the kitchen. It was certainly an improvement on his older work. For one thing, this skeleton was quite intelligent. But that in itself wasn’t a good thing. It meant he was closer to his goal. If he ever made an undead that was capable of leveling—\nShe blinked as Toren appeared in front of her. He was holding something.\n“Is that…a loaf of bread?”\nIt was. An entire loaf, unmarred by imperfections such as slicing or condiments. Toren thrust it at her.\nCeria took it and stared at him.\n“Am I supposed to eat this? I need something else, you know.”\nThe skeleton couldn’t sigh. But Ceria distinctly got that it would if it could. It stared at her and then walked silently back into the kitchen.\nBemused, Ceria sat at a table and stared at the loaf. After a moment, she fished out her belt knife.\nShe’d just managed to cut a few slices away when the skeleton reappeared. It put a bowl down in front of Ceria. She stared at that too. It was also holding eggs.\nToren dropped the eggs in front of Ceria next to the loaf of bread. Then it added a bag of sugar. It went away and brought a cup and a pitcher of water out and then walked back into the kitchen.\nCeria stared at the food on her table. She eyed the eggs, bread, sugar, and the water. She caught one of the eggs before it rolled off the table and stared at it.\nShe shrugged.",

    "text": "When Gerial stumbled downstairs, yawning and rubbing at his eyes, he found Ceria dipping slices of bread into a bowl of egg yolks. Some sugar had also been added to a slice of bread and turned into a sandwich that made him entirely forget about breakfast.\nThe half-Elf looked up as she munched on her dipped slice of bread. She was reading from her spell book.\n“Oh. Hey. The innkeeper’s asleep, so there’s no breakfast. But the skeleton got me some food. Want some?”\nGerial stared at the raw egg dripping from the slice of bread. He shuddered.\n“That’s\ndisgusting.\n”\nCeria rolled her eyes.\n“You Humans. You eat eggs all the time. What’s the difference between frying them and grabbing them from a nest?”\n“A very big difference, thank you.”\nGerial sat at the table and tried not to watch Ceria chomping down her meal. He stared at her cup.\n“Is that sugar?”\n“Goes well with the water if you add enough. Want some?”\nHe hesitated.\n“I think I’d prefer normal food, thanks. Where’s the innkeeper?”\n“Still asleep, I think. She’s in there.”\nCeria nodded to the kitchen.\n“That damn skeleton’s guarding her though, so don’t go in. This is all it gave me to eat.”\n“I see.”\n“Yup. So this is the only food you’re getting for a while. Want some?”\n“Pass.”\nThe two adventurers sat in silence for a while. It wasn’t the first time they’d done this. Gerial was a morning person, and he’d often found Ceria awake. His stomach rumbled, and he tried to ignore it.\nAfter a while, the silence was too much. Gerial had to talk. He rubbed at his mustache and awkwardly cleared his throat. Ceria looked up and raised an eyebrow.\n“So. Last night.”\n“It was quite something, wasn’t it?”\n“Something? It was—”\nGerial didn’t have words to describe it. He was no mage, and the memory of last night stuck in his head as something he could only describe as magical.\n“What\nwas\nthat? Was it a spell?”\n“A Skill, I think. Not one I’ve ever heard of. Must be a rare one.”\n“But that wasn’t it either. Those songs—”\n“Beautiful.”\nCeria smiled, and Gerial nodded fervently. But she didn’t seem as awed as he was by the memory. She frowned slightly.\n“It was amazing. But odd as well.”\n“Odd?”\n“I’ve never heard any of the songs she sang. Not one. And the music that came with it—did it sound like anything you’d ever heard before?”\n“Not even in my dreams.”\nBut Gerial had dreamed of those songs last night. He felt his eyes sting a bit as he remembered and turned his head to wipe at them. Ceria shook her head.\n“They were moving, but that’s not the point, Gerial. It’s another mystery. Where did that music come from? How did that girl—”\nShe glanced up and stopped talking abruptly. That was another thing Gerial was used to, so when Erin stumbled out of the kitchen, he was already turning to greet her.\n“Good morning, Miss Erin.”\nShe stopped and stared at him. She was still wearing the same food-spattered clothing she’d had on yesterday, and the rain and muck had made the smell and sight worse. She also looked miserable.\n“Morning.”\nCeria nodded at Erin. The girl shook her head.\n“Is everything alright?”\nAnother shake. Erin paused, made a face, and reluctantly opened her mouth.\n“I hab a thore throat. And a cold.”\n“Oh.”\n“I see. My condolences.”\nErin staggered over to their table and flopped onto it. Gerial saw the skeleton walk out of the kitchen and stand behind her. Erin didn’t seem to notice—or care.\nCeria put down her book and pushed aside her bowl of egg yolk to peer at Erin. She shook her head.\n“It must have been sitting out in the rain last night that did it.”\n“I bnow.”\nThe half-Elf was already focusing on Erin, her fingers glowing with pale green light.\n“I can do something about the sore throat, but healing potions don’t cure colds. And I wouldn’t recommend you trying one unless you want to roll the dice on it getting better—or turning into a debilitating sickness.”\n“Really? You can—”\nErin\nyelped\nas Ceria poked her throat. Instantly, the skeleton behind her raised a threatening fist, but Erin sat back in her chair.\n“Ow, that—hey! My throat is better!”\nShe still had a stuffed nose, though. Silently, Gerial offered her his handkerchief. Erin blew her nose and looked at him gratefully.\n“Sorry.”\n“Think nothing of it.”\nErin sniffed and handed him the handkerchief back.\n“I hate colds.”\nShe looked at Ceria and Gerial pleadingly.\n“Magic?”\nCeria shook her head at Erin.\n“I’m sorry, but I can’t cure that so easily. I only know [Numb]—the spell I used on your throat—and colds are tricky. Way beyond me. Maybe a [Healer] can cure it? Drink hot soup.”\n“What? But it’s a\ncold.\n”\nErin whined at Ceria. The half-Elf sighed, but remained patient.\n“It’s a cold. The most common of illnesses. Which means no one’s figured out how to get rid of it. And before you suggest it—experimenting on sicknesses can create far worse kinds. Or just make them immune to magical healing at all.”\nGerial was surprised.\n“That can happen? I thought—well, it’s just being sick, isn’t it?”\nThe half-Elf gave him a huge shrug.\n“Don’t ask me. Apparently, things can develop immunities to magic. Mold, diseases—it’s why you don’t always use [Cleanse] to clean even Wistram Academy. They have Golems with mops.”\nErin groaned.\n“Magic-resistant super-viruses. Just what I need.”\nMore words that the adventurers didn’t quite understand, but both got the meaning. Ceria shrugged regretfully at Erin. Then she glanced at Gerial with a slight smile.\n“Looks like breakfast is canceled, Gerial. Unless you all want to risk getting sick before the ruins.”\nHe sighed.\n“No helping it, I suppose.”\n“I can make food.”\nErin tried to sit up, but Ceria gently shook her head.\n“Some rest will do you more good than anything else. And you coughing into the food won’t do anyone any good.”\nShe was right, and Erin sagged back into her seat.\n“Sorry.”\n“Don’t mention it.”\nGerial was already standing and stretching. He was hungry, but it wouldn’t be the first time he’d missed or deferred breakfast until a later date. He nodded at Erin.\n“We’re going into the city. I think Calruz is already gone, but the others are still asleep. Don’t worry about feeding us—they can always go into the city.”\nCeria looked surprised. She glanced upstairs.\n“Calruz is gone? I didn’t hear him moving.”\n“I don’t think he slept. He went after the bug—ah, I mean, the one called Pawn.”\nErin sat up in her chair, suddenly wide awake. She stared around the empty room.\n“\nPawn?\n”",

    "text": "Pawn of the Antinium had not slept since the night. It wasn’t as if he’d missed much sleep, though. Erin Solstice had sung well into the morning, so it was only an hour or two later that he sat outside the Wandering Inn, thinking.\nAnd suffering. He could still feel his missing appendages, or rather, the places where they\nshould\nbe. It felt…horrible. Horrible in a way he couldn’t describe, not to be able to move properly. But there was nothing he could do, and at least the pain had stopped.\nSmall mercies. But the memory of how he had lost his limbs still haunted him. And yet the memory of what had happened last night was with him as well. He still heard the music, still felt his soul shifting,\nhurting\n, rejoicing as he heard Erin sing.\nPain and wonder. They fought for dominion, but the pain was nothing compared to the wonder that still filled him.\nSo he sat and thought. He thought of many things, from his role in the Hive as it had been to what it was now. He thought about what he had suffered and what was happening. He thought about many things and had no answers. But when he thought about Erin Solstice, he felt something else.\nAnd he had no words for that emotion. And it was troubling. In a good way and a bad way, but enough so that when the Minotaur stomped towards him, Pawn was almost glad of the interruption.\n“You.”\nPawn inclined his head respectfully. He didn’t know if he should, but all he knew was his role as a Worker. Yet he wasn’t one anymore. Should he be respectful? It seemed appropriate.\n“Adventurer-Captain Calruz. How may I help you?”\nThe large Minotaur scowled down at Pawn. His eyes were shadowed, and he looked tired. And angry. He’d been walking outside by the looks of it, but now he stopped and stared down at Pawn.\n“Answer me something, insect. Why did you not fight?”\nPawn stared up at Calruz.\n“I’m sorry?”\nThe Minotaur glared at Pawn. He jabbed a finger at Pawn’s chest.\n“You. Why did you not\nfight?\nWhen you were being tortured by your own kind—why did you not resist? Are all of your kind cowards or do you not have any pride?”\nThe question was so surprising to Pawn that he took a few moments to respond.\n“I had no right to resist. The one who took me—he was the Prognugator. He judges other Antinium. Our lives are his to use.”\nCalruz looked disbelievingly at Pawn.\n“So. You would allow death and dishonor to befall you because of mere\nrank\n? The House of Minos respects rank—but even Prince Khedal or our King would expect to be challenged if they spoke or acted madness. Have the Antinium no such sense?”\nPawn did not know what he meant—but he did know his Hive, so he replied slowly. Honestly.\n“The Antinium have no honor. And I am—was a Worker. My life is for the Hive. If my death is required, I will die.”\nFor a long moment, Calruz stared at Pawn. Pawn held his gaze, wondering if the Minotaur would lash out at him. It had happened to several Workers before. But the Minotaur just snorted angrily and turned away.\n“All that I should have expected from a slave.”\nHe stomped towards the door and flung it open. Erin crashed into his chest, and the Minotaur blinked at her.\n“\nPawn!\n”\nShe spotted the Antinium and froze. Pawn got to his feet and nodded at her.\n“Erin. Is something wrong?”\nErin sagged, and some of the color returned to her pale face.\n“You scared me! I thought you went back into the city—!”\n“I was about to. I would not wish to trouble you—”\n“No!”\nPawn was surprised by the vehemence in Erin’s statement. She grabbed him.\n“You can’t go back! Not to that—that evil guy!”\n“Ksmvr?”\n“Yes!”\nErin nodded. She gestured towards her inn.\n“That guy—I’m going to—well, I’d like to—what’s more important is that you stay\nhere\n. Not in that stupid Hive. I’ll make a bed for you, and you can stay as long as you like. Free of charge.”\nPawn stared at the inn and then at the two adventurers who’d followed Erin outside. He shook his head.\n“Your offer is most kind. But I belong in my Hive.”\n“What?”\nHis words seemed to shock the others. But Pawn was used to that. He tried to explain.\n“I am missed. I must complete my duties.”\n“But Ksmvr—”\nThe name made Pawn shudder, but only slightly.\n“He will not harm me.”\n“Bullshit.”\nPawn met Erin’s eyes steadily. He remembered her holding him. Remembered her strange warmth. The music was still in him.\n“He will not harm me, Erin. He has determined that I am Individual. He will not question me further. And I will be protected there. Now that it is known I am Individual, I am—important.”\n“Important?”\nThat seemed to surprise Erin. And her surprise surprised Pawn. How could she not realize? But he had learned how little others knew of the Antinium. But surely she understood this—\n“I still don’t trust that Ksmvr guy. He’s dangerous.”\n“He was merely fulfilling his duties. But once the Queen is told, she will summon me. I am sure of it.”\nThis didn’t seem to reassure Erin at all. She stared at Pawn anxiously, not seeming to understand the great honor this would be.\n“The Queen? And where was she while he was stabbing you?”\n“She is occupied at the moment. It is the Rite of Anastases.”\n“The what the\nwhat?\n”\nPawn shrugged. It was a convenient gesture he had learned, shrugging. He noticed that the half-Elf was staring at him intently behind Erin as the Human and Minotaur talked.\n“I do not know. I only heard what was spoken in passing. But it is an important ritual that cannot be interrupted. I…sense that.”\nErin stared at him. She did not understand, and Pawn worried that she would try to keep him. That would lead to conflict, and he could not allow her to be hurt. But the half-Elf spoke to him.\n“You—ah, Pawn. Can you tell me something? What do the Antinium want?”\n“To work for the Hive and the Queen.”\nIt was an automatic response, and not the one she wanted. Ceria shook her head.\n“I’ve heard that from every Antinium—I mean, what do they want\nhere?\nThe Antinium have made war for two decades. They never leave their Hivelands—except during the last two great wars, and they only settled one Hive in one city in the entire world. The Blighted Kingdom hates them, and no one knows what your people want except to conquer. The Antinium are united as far as I’ve heard. Completely. You’re all loyal to your Queens. So…why did this Ksmvr take you and—and question you?”\nMore hard questions. Pawn tried to answer as best he could.\n“We came ten years back. To make…make something. I do not know. I do not know\nwhat\n. But it was decided. The Queens sent a single Hive to the city. Paid in gold for a place with those not of the Hive. To make something. A new kind of Antinium.”\nIt seemed Ceria and Calruz were listening hard to this, though making sense of it was beyond them and Erin. Ceria bit her lip.\n“And this Rite of…does that relate to it?”\n“No. Yes. It is important. I cannot tell you what it is. I was not told. I can only\nsense\nthat it requires all of my Queen’s attention.”\n“But when she’s done with it, she’ll want to see you, is that right?”\n“Yes.”\n“And you’re important.”\n“Yes.”\nEasier answers. Pawn saw the light of comprehension in the half-Elf’s eyes. But Erin still did not understand. Pawn saw that too. But the half-Elf did. She tugged at Erin’s arm.\n“I think I get it. Erin, Pawn needs to go back to his Hive. You can’t take an Antinium away from the Hive. If you do—they spare no effort to reclaim their lost. Or if it’s impossible to reclaim them, those Antinium die.”\nErin’s heart sank.\n“They do?”\nOnly in times of war. Pawn knew with absolute certainty his Queen would never order him to die. He was too important. But the lie—\n“That is correct. I would be in jeopardy or place you in danger by remaining.”\nIt hurt him to lie to Erin. But it was partially true. Once his Queen learned of his nature, she would spare no effort to reclaim him. And if Ksmvr tried to reclaim him and brought soldiers—\nThe thought of it was too much to bear. So Pawn lied. He lied to protect the one called Erin Solstice, the innkeeper who played chess and who sang. The one who had given him his individuality and more things than he could think. The one who was important. The one who the other Workers…\nAdmired. Perhaps that was the word for it. But Pawn thought it wasn’t the right word. What Erin was to the Workers was different. She had brought something into their stale lives and taught them that they\nhad\nbeen living in boredom and monotony. She had elevated one of them, and so what the Workers felt for her was not admiration. It was something else. Another word.\nBut Pawn had no idea what that word was.",

She threw a cup of water at Toren.\nShe hated being sick. And she was so tired—she’d barely gotten, what, a few hours of sleep? So Erin put her head down on her pillow in the kitchen. Just for a short nap. It was just a bit too much.\nBefore she knew it, she’d fallen asleep. All things considered, it was good for her.

But the odds were quite good that there were adventurers still in the inn and therefore quite good that the screaming didn’t mean anything\ntoo\ndangerous was happening.\nStill, he cast [Invisibility] before he entered. It was a wonderful spell. A Tier 4 magic like this afforded him far more safety than any armor and allowed him a number of useful opportunities as well. It had been worth the month of study it had taken to master it.\nNevertheless, Pisces poked his head cautiously through the inn’s door. Safety was paramount. He would run at the slightest hint of trouble—\nBut curse it, Erin Solstice might be in trouble. And after last night, he couldn’t just abandon her. Not just because he’d heard what those arrogant Gnolls had said. They might be stealthy, but they relied on their noses too much. Pisces smelled exactly like the outdoors because he never bothered to wash. Another advantage.\nAnd the music. He couldn’t forget the music. An [Immortal Moment] indeed. All of it meant—well, it meant—\nIt meant he was doing something stupid, which Pisces regretted. He readied several spells as he looked around the inn. If it was a monster, he’d attack and retreat. That was all he could do. More than he should do, really.\nThere was no monster in the inn. Not unless you counted the skeleton, and Pisces wasn’t afraid of his own creation. The cowering female Drake didn’t seem to share his opinion, however.\nPisces relaxed and let the invisibility spell end. His heart was beating far,\nfar\ntoo fast. Curses. He recognized the Drake. She was a female receptionist at the Adventurer’s Guild, the one who often talked to Erin. Selys Shivertail.\nShe was still whimpering and trying to shield herself from Toren as the skeleton stood watching her. Pisces shook his head. Non-mages. They were so…\nHe looked around for Erin Solstice. She was nowhere to be seen, which was inconvenient. He had hoped for some food—\nPisces was used to wandering into the kitchen of the Wandering Inn for food. He’d done it quite often, and so it was quite a shock to him when Toren shot out a bony arm to block his way. He yelped and stumbled backwards.\n“What are you doing?”\nHis creation studied Pisces. Toren didn’t reply—not that Pisces had given him the ability to speak. The mage paused and gestured with his fingers.\n“Move aside. I require sustenance.”\nA flicker of hesitation—and then the skeleton shook his head. Pisces frowned.\n“I am your creator. Move aside.”\nAnother shake of the head. Pisces frowned darkly. This was wrong. But of course, he had expected complications when he’d created this skeleton. He just hadn’t expected the spell-weaving to interfere with the obedience of the skeleton—\n“Move.”\nThe skeleton clattered its jaw at Pisces and raised a finger to shush him. He blinked at it.\n“What are you—I, Pisces, order you to move aside and let me pass.”\nAnother shake of the head. Pisces ground his teeth. He was about to try something more drastic when something\nslapped\nthe back of his head hard. He staggered and looked around.\n“You!”\nSomething was attacking him. Pisces yelped as Selys advanced on him, hitting him with her fists.\n“You’re the one who made this—this\nthing\n, aren’t you? You evil, wretched—!”\nSelys yelped as Toren caught her hand. She nearly screamed, but the other bony hand covered her mouth. Pisces froze. Was his creation going to—?\nToren held Selys in a grip of death. Very, very slowly he removed his hand from her mouth and raised it to his own. One finger went up, and he\nshushed\nher.\nSelys quivered as she nodded. Toren gently let go of her hand. Then the skeleton pointed inside the kitchen.\nBoth Pisces and Selys stared inside the kitchen and saw Erin curled up into a ball, still sleeping somehow. They exchanged a look.\nToren moved back in front of the kitchen entrance and stood there, a sentinel. He stared pointedly at both mage and Drake. Slowly, the skeleton reached for a sword belted to its bony waist. It unsheathed the blade an inch. They backed away.",

The small Goblin wasn’t happy, but Toren didn’t have to dissuade her from entering the kitchen.\nInstead, the Goblin hopped up onto one of the chairs and grabbed a chess board. She muttered to herself as Toren stood patiently in his place in front of the kitchen. He stared impassively at the Goblin as she ignored him.\nPerhaps someone who wasn’t an undead skeleton might have had a bit more of a reaction to Rags’ appearance. They might have questioned the cuts on the side of her face, the way she winced as she moved, or perhaps the glowing, orange-pink potion strapped to her belt. It was one of many valuable items that an astute watcher could infer had been looted from travellers.\nBut Toren wasn’t interested in any of that. Instead, the skeleton was troubled by his own thoughts. He was guarding his master, and that was well. But he had failed to guard a few days ago. He had lost to the Antinium, and that was wrong. Bad. He felt this should not be so.\nBut he was still only a Level 3 [Skeleton Warrior]. He had no way to level except in the [Barmaid] class, and Toren felt that this would not be particularly helpful.\nRags muttered to herself as she began playing a game of chess.

She groused to herself in her own language.\nAgain, to any other listener, her words would be meaningless nonsense.

    "text": "Erin woke up to the noise that defined her life.\nThe sounds of chess.\nIt was a soft sound, most of the time—one she’d learned in all of its subtleties. Chess sounded different.\nThe board mattered, for one thing. Erin usually played with wooden pieces—the ones from the DGT electronic chess board manufacturing line. It was the board chess tournaments used because of the sensors and electronic timer wired into the board itself.\nIt even had a chess computer you could buy to play against. It was high-tech, and Erin didn’t like it.\nShe loved the sound and feel of stone pieces, like the one she’d bought for her inn and had in her personal collection in her home. Her home in the real world, her world, that was.\nHow seldom she thought of it. And her parents. It was almost as if…unless she thought, she forgot they had ever been. Was she just blocking them out as a self-defense reflex? It hurt Erin, wondering what they were doing and thinking, looking for her, worrying.\nBut today was a day for feeling pain.\nAnd she indulged her own worry, wishing she could tell them—anything—until the sounds drew her upwards.\nThe soft clicking of stone on stone roused Erin gently. She sat up and reached for the rag she’d left near her head and blew her nose.\nOf course, stone chess sets were a lot more fragile, and it was inevitable that someone would drop a piece sooner or later. That was why she only brought it out if she was playing someone who held the same reverence for chess as she did.\nYes—the rhythm told her other things, too. This was a slower chess game because one player was worse than the other. You could almost feel it. One of the two players was decisive, confident, and skilled enough to back up their abilities. They moved almost as soon as the other player did. But the other one paused and hesitated.\nDifferent sounds for different players. Erin remembered the sound of cheap plastic being slammed down by impatient players, ones who grew angry when they were losing and excited over small gains. Bad players? Young players. Amateurs.\nProfessional chess players got mad too, but in different ways. Sometimes they got loud, but many went cold and focused everything in a silent battle. You could almost tell when a game was getting good, yes. Not by the noise—\nBut by the silence.\nBut in this case, the game wasn’t good. Erin could tell that in the moment she walked out of the kitchen, rubbing the sleep from her eyes.\nRags sat in front of a chess board, arms crossed while she stared at the skeleton sitting opposite her. Erin stared too. Toren’s presence threw her, but the chess—the chess was easy to understand.\nIt was a bad game. A very bad game. Rags had nearly all of her pieces—including her pawns—and Toren’s pieces were scattered.\nContrary to what people thought, a one-sided game wasn’t fun. Winning against an inferior opponent wasn’t fun.\nErin said as much after Rags effortlessly checkmated Toren’s king. Both Goblin and skeleton turned.\n“I don’t know how you got him to play, but he clearly doesn’t know\nhow\nto play.”\nRags shrugged indifferently as Toren sprang to his feet. Erin sighed. Her skeleton was playing chess. At this point, she wasn’t surprised.\n“Sit down.”\nToren sat. Erin pulled a chair over and slumped down on the table, resting her chin on her arms. She stared at Rags. The Goblin was busy rearranging her side, probably in expectation of playing Erin.\nThe small Goblin looked—battered. Was she hurt? If she was, she didn’t show it.\n“How many games did you play?”\nRags paused and thought. She held up both hands with all five fingers splayed out. Then she kicked Toren. The skeleton held out its fingers too, keeping two down.\n“Eighteen games? That’s a lot. And how many did he win?”\nRags grinned. Erin snorted, but in some sympathy for the skeleton as it sat there.\n“That’s what I thought.”\nThen again, there were always a few players who relished beating down amateurs. Especially kids. Erin had been one of the whiz-kids, the child prodigies of chess growing up. She’d known a few kids her age that positively enjoyed bullying adults.\nShe, uh…Erin had to admit that a younger girl-Erin might have been one of those children at times. But she’d grown out of it. She thought she had.\nIt was a sign of immaturity. Erin frowned at Rags, and the little Goblin looked away, scowling. How old was she? How old was she in Goblin years?\n“You should at least teach him how to play. Here.”\nErin pointed to another chess board, and Toren went to fetch it. Mechanically, she set up her side on both the boards facing her.\n“I’ll teach you and get revenge, deal?”\nThe skeleton said nothing. But it sat obediently opposite Erin as Rags frowned at her board and carefully moved the knight forwards.\n“It’s all about positioning, see? I don’t know if you saw me playing chess, but it’s a bit different than everyone thinks.”\nErin casually moved a piece on Rags’ board and then showed Toren.\n“See this central area? Most openings or chess strategies revolve around capturing or controlling this spot. And that’s because your pieces need to move to get in position to attack the enemy. It’s not always about just killing other pieces. It’s about proper setup and luring the enemy into traps.”\nShe played a few moves with Toren, watching and commenting as the skeleton moved.\n“Everyone—well, everyone where I come from—knows the basic openings. You have to if you want to play chess. But chess is as much about reading the opponent as it is setting up your board. You trick them, open holes in their defenses. There’s all kinds of ways to do that. Forks, pins, deflection, checks, skewers, batteries…”\nShe began chattering away, a chess enthusiast unloading on a hapless victim. Toren absorbed it all like a sponge as she played a very light game against him, letting the skeleton learn as it lost.\nRags muttered as she lost her queen. Erin pointed to Toren as he tried to move his king and shook her head.\n“I’ll let you take that one back. Try not to move the king so much. You can castle him to move if you have to, but he shouldn’t be the piece you keep moving. That’s usually a bad sign.”\nShe smiled, nostalgia gripping her. She’d had to learn that the hard way, too.\n“I know you want to because he’s so important and you want to keep him safe, but you do that with other pieces. They’re the king’s shield and sword. Yeah, you don’t move the king. Because—”\nA flicker of memory. The words came out of Erin automatically.\n“The king is smart and uses his head. For if he moves, he’ll soon be dead.”\nRags and Toren stared at Erin. She blinked. That was it. She\nremembered\n.\n“Oh. Um. That was a little rhyme I made up when I was a kid. It—it’s important.”\nIt felt that way, but Erin couldn’t remember why. It was just a silly thing she’d made up. But—\n“Where was I?”\nShe stared at the board and found she had a way to checkmate Toren. She showed him it and then glanced at the fuming Rags.\n“Why don’t you try again? You’ll probably lose, but—”\nErin stared at Toren. It—he—it was an undead creature. Who knew how fast they could learn? It wasn’t as if he had a bad memory—he didn’t have a brain. Erin was suddenly gripped by curiosity, probably just as Rags had been. She wanted to see Toren play.\nCarefully, she showed Toren a few classic openings and played slowly through another game as she crushed Rags again. Then she set up a board for the Goblin and skeleton and sat back.\n“Do you get it? Let’s see.”\nRags and Erin waited. After a moment, Toren moved a piece. Rags countered. The game lasted for about sixteen more moves before she checkmated him.\n“You don’t get it.”\nToren clattered his jaw. Erin sighed.\n“Don’t try taking your rook out so quickly. Remember—capture the center at the start and reinforce. Try again.”\nHe did. Two games later, Erin had to face facts.\n“Great. My undead skeleton sucks at chess.”\nIt wasn’t that he was\nbad,\nit was just",

    "text": "Okay, he was bad. Erin saw it as she played Rags and Toren at the same time. He was just an amateur.\nWhich was totally fine. But it was a marked contrast from the Antinium and Rags. The Workers might have been inexperienced, but they were fast learners who memorized openings and counters with ease. And Rags was gifted.\nCompared to that, Toren was just normal. Not hopeless—she could see his game had improved from the travesty it had been before her coaching. It was just that he had no spark.\nErin sighed. She took one of Rags’ knights and ignored the little Goblin hissing in anger.\n“Check.”\nIt was a shame. But there was something in her that was still happy. Even if her skeleton sucked, he was still playing chess. Even if she was sitting in another world, in an inn playing against a Goblin, she was still playing chess.\nThat was good. It made her feel at ease. It was the only thing that made her feel happy, really. Because it was the only thing she was good at. It was the only thing she knew how to do.",

    "text": "Ceria and Gerial walked through the city, talking. They were alone. Alone in a sea of Drakes and Gnolls and the occasional Antinium.\nThey were outsiders. But then, adventurers were always outsiders. They were used to it.\nAnd perhaps if it had been another week, another place, they would have been laughing, joking, and exploring a new city. But this was different. They walked and talked seriously, ignoring the hostile looks they got from the locals.\nIt was easy to be swept away in the inn they’d found. It was a soothing place, and far enough away that they could relax. But here, in the city, they were too close. The Ruins were several miles away from the city, but they might as well have been next to the adventurers. Their nerves hummed, and their hearts beat a little faster in anticipation of what was coming.\n“Soon.”\nCeria nodded. She touched the knife at her belt and felt the hidden wand strapped to her arm.\n“Rot, I wish it were tomorrow. No wonder the other adventurers wanted to stay at the inn. I can’t relax at all, here.”\nGerial nodded. He stepped aside politely for a female Drake and ignored her as she flicked her tongue out at him.\n“The, ah, local reception isn’t helping either.”\n“Well, what do you expect? They don’t exactly like Humans down here, and I’m just another annoying adventurer. But that’s not what I’m talking about. You can feel it, can’t you?”\nHe could. Gerial was a veteran adventurer, and he sensed the same thing Ceria was tapping into. There was an undercurrent among the adventurers in the city. Fear—as well as expectation.\nThe Ruins of Liscor were a huge find, possibly the biggest in a decade. Untold and unplundered treasures were just waiting for the taking, the kind of rewards that could elevate any adventuring group into Gold-rank—or higher. But by the same token, the dangers were just as unknown.\n“We still don’t know what’s down there. Cervial found someone who was willing to explore and map out the first level, but no one is willing to go any further.”\n“And he hasn’t found anyone who’s ventured further?”\n“No one who’s gone down too far past the stairs has ever come back.”\nGerial tugged at his belt unconsciously. His hand touched the pommel of his sword and then moved away as a Gnoll guardsman glanced at him.\nThat was it. That was the fear. Something was down there, and whatever it was, it was deadly. So much so that the treasure-lust of the other adventurers was being kept at bay.\nWhat might be hiding down there? A bagrhaven? A nest of them, perhaps. But something that could kill a team of Silver-ranks without letting any of them live—\nA trap? A colony of wurms? Some—some kind of undead army? Or—Gerial’s blood ran cold at the thought—had they dug up the burial site of one of the Old Things?\nNo. No, there was no sense in thinking of it. But that\nwas\nthe thing. Uncertainty was keeping these adventurers at bay. Once they knew what was down there, those who could take on the threat would band together and deal with it in a heartbeat. Adventurers would swarm over the ruins, stealing, fighting each other, trying to grab as much as possible.\nAll it took was the first, brave group who would uncover the secrets below and pay with blood. And for once, it was the Horns of Hammerad who would be paying that price.\n“Hey.”\nGerial blinked and jerked in surprise as the elbow caught him in the side. He glanced down at Ceria and saw she was staring up at him.\n“Don’t go panicking on me, now. We’ll be fine, so stop worrying.”\nHe smiled, but Ceria’s jab had brought him back into reality. Casually, he rubbed at the spot she’d hit, wondering if he’d have a bruise.\n“Someone has to worry. As far as our leader is concerned, this is going to be a simple extermination request, nothing more.”\nCeria made a face.\n“Calruz is arrogant. But he’s confident and bold, which is why he’s perfect for a vice-Captain like you.”\nGerial felt the statement should have been reversed, but he smiled at the compliment anyways. Then he frowned.\n“The [Illumination] spell. How’s it going?”\nCeria shrugged.\n“My mastery of it is—incomplete. I’ll keep studying, but my best guess is that I’ll be able to cast it once and then I’ll need a mana potion. It’s too exhausting to use multiple times in a row.”\n“Once should be enough. Just so we have an area permanently lit to fall back to.”\n“We’ve got the formations worked out. Stop—”\n“Yes, yes. And supplies are underway. It’s just—”\n“I know.”\nCeria patted Gerial on the shoulder.\n“I know, believe me. I’m feeling it too. But we’ve planned for as much as we can, and we’ll pull out the instant there’s trouble. Don’t worry.”\nHe smiled at her. It was reassuring to have someone as old as Ceria in the group with him. She was over sixty years old, and if she hadn’t spent all that time adventuring, he was still glad she was here. In truth, he felt it was she who should be the vice-Captain, but she’d always refused.\nMainly because she didn’t want to do all the logistical work.\nTheir talk turned to lighter things. Neither Gerial nor Ceria were new to adventuring or the risks of exploring dungeons. Gerial had been an adventurer for eight years—Ceria for fourteen.\n“Say we do get gold and gems rather than a magical item. We have the largest shares after the Captains. What would you buy?”\nCeria smiled and eyed a few carved bracelets on display in a Gnoll’s shop. The large Gnoll woman eyed the half-Elf and bared her teeth politely, gesturing in an invitation. Ceria waved her hand, and they continued on.\n“If I have enough, I’d like to buy another spell book. All the ones I have I’ve more or less mastered. With enough gold—a few hundred pieces more—I could buy a book with a few Tier 4 spells.”\n“Just that? If the reward is all Calruz thinks it could be, you’d have a lot more money than that.”\nCeria raised an eyebrow at Gerial.\n“You’ve never bought spell books, have you? Just one costs several hundred gold or thousands, and that’s for low-Tier spells. I’ve been saving up all this time just to buy one with a Tier 4 spell.”\n“But if you leveled up your, um, [Mage] class, you’d learn those anyways, right?”\nThe half-Elf ran a hand through her hair distractedly. It was messy because she didn’t always comb it, and he resisted the urge to offer her his comb.\n“Right, but—it’s complicated. There’s no guarantee which spells I’d learn, and besides, I’d need to level up quite a bit. But with a spell book, I could study a spell and learn it in a few months.”\n“A few\nmonths?\n”\n“A month, a year, two years—so what? If I mastered just one good spell, my Level would increase. And then we could take on stronger monsters.”\nGerial shook his head.\n“A good thing I was never born with a talent for magic. I don’t have your patience—or your time.”\n“Oh, and then what would you buy?”\n“Armor. And a good sword. Or maybe just a magic ring.”\nCeria laughed.\n“Not too adventurous, are you?”\nGerial smiled as he shook his head, a warrior talking to a mage.\n“A good set of magic armor? I’d be able to fight without worrying about some monster clubbing my helmet in every five seconds.”\n“I suppose. It just seems like a waste, that’s all.”\n“Every bit counts. If I had good armor, I could worry about other expenses. But that’s the first step.”\n“True enough.”\nMoney. It was such a simple thing. But it was the bane of an adventurer’s existence. They earned more than skilled workers, but to keep adventuring, they needed more. The Guild had its own fees for enrollment, armor repairs and healing potions were\nexpensive,\nand an injury could leave one out of work for months. It was so\nhard\nto earn money.\n“A good sword.”\nGerial murmured into his mustache.\n“If I had that, I could polish my sword skills. Rank up. Start earning a Gold-rank adventurer’s pay…”\n“And then perhaps you’d be able to talk to a certain Runner without needing me to push you, hm?”\nGerial turned red.\n“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”\n“Of course you don’t. You Human—no, you males. Idiots who fall in love with the first exotic female you see. You and Calruz both.”\nGerial took the ribbing with good humor, although he didn’t point out that the first exotic female he’d ever laid eyes on was Ceria. It would have made the half-Elf blush and then retreat. Or—worse—\nengage\nand discuss the matter frankly\n.\nHe had learned long ago that her heart had been closed long ago to Human men.\nNevertheless, he was quite glad when he spotted a familiar face sitting at an outdoor stall, eating pieces of roasted meat off of a skewer.\n“Sostrom!”\nThe mage looked up and grinned around a mouthful of food as Gerial and Ceria sat to join him. They ordered a skewer of their own as the Drake shopkeeper rotated the sticks of meat over a fire.\n“I saw you two had already left. The innkeeper—Miss Solstice was sick, so we all took our leave without breakfast.”\nGerial nodded. He’d had a late breakfast with Ceria, but his appetite returned quickly as he inhaled the scents of roasted animal.\n“Have you seen Calruz?”\n“Not since last night. Why?”\n“He left the inn, and he hasn’t slept since last night, I think. You know what he’s like when he’s irritable.”\nSostrom made a face.\n“Let the Watch deal with him. I don’t get paid to restrain him when he causes trouble.”\n“If he gets arrested before we enter the Ruins—”\n“The city will let him go if we pay a fine. And they’ll be happier to let him fight monsters than cause trouble in jail.”\nThere was truth in that statement, so Gerial let it go. He twisted around to look towards the gates where the inn lay.\n“So. A strange [Innkeeper] we’ve met. I’ve never met stranger, have you?”\nThe half-Elf frowned.\n“…A few that are weird. I heard there’s a former Gold-rank [Innkeeper] up north. Terrible fellow. Sometimes they’re characters, but yes, she beats the lot for originality. But it seems we’ve run across more than one strange girl as of late.”\n“Ryoka.”\nGerial accepted a stick of meat and handed over coins for both him and Ceria. He bit into the hot meat and glanced at Ceria.\n“What Yvlon said the other day. You’re sure she has no levels?”\nCeria shrugged.\n“That’s what Cervial said. And Yvlon seemed to know something about her as well.”\n“The entire incident was unfortunate.”\n“It was her fault.”\n“Perhaps, but Yvlon needn’t have challenged her. That wasn’t a fair fight no matter how you look at it.”\nThat was true. Gerial looked at Sostrom.\n“You’re right. I’d forgotten because she won, but since when do the Silver Spears fight civilians?”\n“Let alone in armor. Even if it was bravado, Yvlon would have never taken that fight normally. Makes you wonder, don’t it? What Yvlon knew. Or—what her aunt told her.”\nGerial and Ceria exchanged a quick glance. Gerial whistled long and low under his breath.\n“Lady Magnolia.”\nSostrom nodded.\n“There’s a name that tells you how important she is.”\nGerial scratched at his chin as he glanced at the Human [Mage] for clarification.\n“Yvlon important? Or Ryoka important?”\n“Ryoka. I hear Yvlon doesn’t lean on her family connections or even her brother, who’s also a\nGold-\nrank adventurer. But Ryoka has Lady Reinhart following her every move.”\nThe Human [Mage] nodded again for emphasis. He scratched at his forehead under his pointy hat. Sostrom was completely bald, and as such, wore his mage’s hat whenever possible.\n“That object I repaired, her fist-fighting skill. Her lack of levels…it’s enough to interest me, but why a scion of the Five Families? There’s something else to her, mark my words.”\n“I hope she doesn’t do anything rash.”\nCeria snorted into her food. Gerial made a face.\n“You know what I mean.”\n“Just hope she survives. Once we’re done here, we can ask her more questions.”\n“It could be a while if these ruins are as deep as they seem.”\n“She’s a big Human. She’ll be fine.”\n“Well, since we’re on the topic of secrets…what’s the story behind you and this Pisces character? I thought I saw him last night, but you two hardly shared a word.”\n“That was intentional. I get a headache whenever I have to talk to that idiot for too long.”\nCeria sighed, but Sostrom frowned.\n“You might make fun of him, but he\nis\na graduate of Wistram when all is said and done. And that display with healing Ryoka’s leg was nothing short of phenomenal. I certainly wouldn’t want to test myself against him.”\nGerial blinked at Sostrom. While Sostrom was the lower-level and self-trained [Mage] in the Horns of Hammerad compared to Ceria, Gerial had still grown to appreciate his ability. He couldn’t cast [Fireball], but he had a lot of good tricks and Ceria respected him. That was high praise.\n“This Pisces is that good of a mage?”\nSostrom nodded seriously.\n“I sensed it. He has quite a few levels on me, I suspect. Perhaps the same as our Ceria?”\nBoth men looked over. Ceria scowled and shrugged.\n“Maybe. But he’s still an idiot.”\n“An idiot from Wistram.”\n“He’s not…well, technically he’s a graduate. But some mages wouldn’t consider him one.”\n“Wait. You said—”\nThe half-Elf looked unusually defensive. She began speaking faster, hunching her shoulders, and Gerial knew she rarely talked about her past—her upbringing, yes. Not Wistram.\n“He was expelled. But you’re right. He was always at the head of his class whenever he showed up. If he had the money, he could have advanced quite highly. But he dropped out about the same time I, uh, ran out of funds.”\n“And he was expelled for his experiments. Yes, I recall. But does he have any combat aptitude? We could hire him for the expedition.”\nCeria glanced incredulously up at Gerial.\n“I wouldn’t trust that idiot with my back.”\n“Aren’t you being a little too harsh?”\n“\nNo.\n”\n“But what’s his level? A mage living alone like he is has to have some skills. And a [Necromancer] would be perfect if there’s a large amount of undead in the ruins. Come on, Ceria, at least tell us his classes.”\nCeria made a face.\n“I—oh, alright. As far as I can remember, he has the most levels in the [Necromancer] class, but he knows quite a few mundane spells too. He\nmight\nbe Level 20+ just as a pure [Mage] if you want to rank him. And he knows at least one Tier 4 spell. He was always good at—”\n“Excuse me.”\nAll three adventurers turned. Gerial and Sostrom blinked as they stared into one very large eye and a slight smile. Ceria dropped her half-eaten skewer of meat.\nGazi Pathseeker smiled politely at the three adventurers and bowed her head slightly.\n“Greetings. I hope I’m not interrupting?”\nThere was a brief moment of assessment that Gerial and Sostrom went through. Their eyes noted the quality of Gazi’s armor. Unlike pedestrians, the brown and rust-red color of her equipment didn’t fool their eyes. Her armor was clearly high-quality, and her sword made the two adventurers look twice.\nThat would have already told them she was Gold-rank or higher. But Gazi wore no armband or markings to indicate her rank. That either meant she was unaffiliated with the Guild or—\nGerial cleared his throat and stood up from his seat. He tried not to stammer.\n“Um, pardon me. But you wouldn’t happen to be…?”\n“I am Gazi.”\nThey had never seen her face, but both men had heard her name. Instantly, Sostrom was out of his seat and offering her his while Gazi politely refused. Ceria was still staring.\nWhen Gerial had calmed down slightly, he tried to be as accommodating as possible.\n“Um, how can we help you Miss, ah—Adventurer Pathseeker?”\nShe smiled at Gerial. He felt a shock as her eye met his. In his stunned state, Gerial briefly wished Ceria would stop staring and be more respectful.\n“You are members of the Horns of Hammerad, aren’t you?”\n“Um yes, I mean, that’s correct. We are. All of us.”\n“That is good.”\nGazi smiled again. It wasn’t a broad smile—rather, a mysterious small one that fit her perfectly. She nodded.\n“I wished to speak with you.”\nGerial and Sostrom were agog.\n“With us? You know our names?”\n“Is it not appropriate? The Horns of Hammerad are well known in the cities around here.”\nThat\nwas enough to inflate both men’s chests. Gazi’s eye flicked towards Ceria for a brief moment as she continued speaking.",

    "text": "“I have visited several Human cities to the north. And strangely, come back here chasing rumors. I hoped you could assist me.”\n“Anything.”\nGerial breathed the words. The smile he got made his stomach jump.\n“I have heard—from several sources—of a most extraordinary Human female in this area. A Runner. I believe her name is Ryoka Griffin. A levelless girl who braved the High Passes and survived. A most…\ninteresting\nperson in short. And I am told the Horns of Hammerad are her acquaintances.”\nGerial and Sostrom exchanged a glance. How much of a coincidence could it be? Gerial vaguely noticed Ceria coming to stand next to him.\n“We do—we do know that girl! We were in her company only two days ago.”\nGazi’s smile widened.\n“Ah. So you know her. Good. Tell me, is she all that people say she is?”\n“That and more.”\nSostrom nodded eagerly. Gerial glared, but the bald mage had beaten him to the punch.\n“She—well, I don’t know that she’s levelless, but another adventurer with [Appraisal] says it’s true. And she\ndid\nsurvive the High Passes. And she has the favor of Lady Magnolia.\nAnd\nshe runs barefoot.”\n“Indeed? How fascinating. I should very much like to meet her. You wouldn’t happen to know where she is by any chance?”\nGerial and Sostrom both opened their mouths, but incredibly, it was Ceria who beat both of them.\n“We don’t, I’m afraid. She moves around all the time, so it’s hard to pin her down.”\nGerial felt something on his foot and looked down. Ceria had stepped on his foot for some reason. And Sostrom’s as well. Why? He glanced at Sostrom and saw the other man was blinking and touching at his head.\nBut Gazi was looking at Gerial, and suddenly, his attention was focused completely on her.\n“Ah, but I would dearly like to meet her. Would you happen to know where she stays?”\n“Celum. There’s an inn she stays at quite often there, and she takes most of her requests there.”\nCeria stepped on his foot again. Gerial glanced at her, irritated. She mouthed something but then Gazi was speaking.\n“Which inn?”\n“The Bloody Tankard.”\nThis time, Ceria abandoned all pretense and jabbed Gerial\nhard\nin the side. He winced and looked down at her, confused.\nCeria sighed and shoved Gerial back. Sostrom interposed himself between the vice-Captain and Gazi, averting his gaze from Gazi’s eye. So did Ceria. She spoke to the air just over Gazi’s shoulder.\n“Excuse me, Miss Gazi. But why the interest in Ryoka?”\nGazi’s eye shifted towards Ceria, but the half-Elf refused to meet her gaze.\n“I would simply like to meet her.”\nHer eye focused on Ceria, and Gazi’s slight smile grew a fraction. Ceria bit the inside of her lip until it bled.\n“Well, you have the name of her inn. And we haven’t seen her. So if that’s all—”\n“She was in Esthelm just two days ago!”\nCeria cursed and whirled to glare at Gerial. Behind her, she heard Gazi chuckle.\n“And do you have any way of finding her now? Or perhaps you know where she’s going?”\n“We do not.”\nCeria cut Gerial off. She glared at Gazi, focusing hard, channeling mana into her eyes as a shield.\n“We don’t know anything else. So stop asking. We would like to be left in peace.”\nGazi was still smiling.\n“But I have more questions to ask about Ryoka. And I feel you can answer them.”\n“I’ve got nothing for you. So you can take your answers and shove them.”\nGazi blinked. Ceria gasped as the pressure on her vanished. The half-Gazer looked disappointed.\n“Hm. You would not answer questions for me? I am a Named Adventurer, you know. And you are, ah, yes, Silver-rank. Tradition would dictate you help me to the best of your abilities.”\nCeria snapped at Gazi.\n“I know who you are. And a former soldier isn’t the same as a true adventurer. We got our levels from fighting monsters, not killing people.”\n“But I am still higher rank than you. I could be…troublesome to you if you refuse to help.”\n“I don’t help the insane. You and your mad king can go to hell for all I care—”\nGazi didn’t so much move as\nblur\n. One moment she was smiling, posture relaxed, talking calmly to Ceria. The next, the edge of her sword was suddenly at Ceria’s throat. And she was no longer smiling.\n“I do not suffer insults to my lord’s name.”\nIt took a second for the two men behind Ceria to react. When they did, Gerial swore and went for his sword and Sostrom reached for his wand. But they both froze as Gazi poked the tip of the razor sharp blade a bit further into Ceria’s neck.\n“How inconvenient. And we were doing so well with politeness. But I will have an answer. But first—an apology. I will hear it from you on your knees, half-Elf.”\nCeria was sweating. The blade was not pricking her throat, but lodged into her skin. She was already bleeding. If it went in just another inch—\nPerhaps it was because it had been so quick. Gazi hadn’t attracted attention when she’d drawn her sword because she’d moved so fast no one had seen it leave her sheath\n.\nBut it was hard to ignore a drawn blade at the throat of a half-Elf in the middle of the street.\nPeople began noticing the standoff and panicking in the course of a few moments. Within seconds, the pedestrians cleared out, and the adventurers could hear someone calling the Watch.\nThey were using a high-pitched whistle, which gave off a shrill whine that was impossible to ignore. Gazi didn’t lower her sword, though one of her smaller eyes rolled around in her head. Neither Gerial nor Sostrom moved either, and Ceria was already on her tiptoes. They knew how fast the Watch would react and didn’t panic.\nThe filthy girl hiding behind the stall was no seasoned adventurer, however, and she heard the whistle and thought it was for her. She rushed out from behind the shopkeeper’s stall, appearing in the street as her [Invisibility] spell failed.\nCeria was afraid to turn her head, but Sostrom and Gerial saw a blonde head of hair, filthy travelling clothes, pale skin, and the flash of magic. The girl raised an emerald ring, shouted something as she pointed at the adventurers, and then fled.\nFrom her ring, a huge, thick tendril of what looked like spider web shot out, growing larger and spreading out. It flew at the adventurers like a bird.\nGerial and Sostrom had seen the spell, and they were already diving for the ground. The cobwebs struck their backs and stuck to them, instantly anchoring them with tendrils of silk as strong as stone.\nCeria could do nothing but watch as the spider webs flew at her. They wrapped around her, and she fell to the ground, instantly cocooned. Gazi’s blade would have cut her—but the Gazer moved it out of the way just in time.\nGazi eyed the unfurling spider web and flicked her sword twice. The tendrils of webbing fell at her feet, neatly severed.\nGazi\ntsked\nin irritation and glanced around as the piercing whine continued.\nThe girl with the magic was nowhere to be seen. She’d already fled down an alleyway.\n“How inconvenient. I suppose I must ask my questions another time.”\nShe looked down at Ceria, and the half-Gazer’s eyes were hard.\n“But make no mistake. I\nshall\nsee you again and ask more questions. Unless of course I find this Ryoka Griffin first.”\nShe smiled then, her slight, mysterious smile.\n“Farewell.”\nGazi turned and strode off. Her legs were a blur as she disappeared into an alleyway.\n“Damnation!”\nGerial cursed as he fought the webs. But they had anchored him to the ground.\n“What kind of magical artifact was that? Sostrom, I’m pinned. Can you—?”\n“My wand is caught!”\nThe Human [Mage] cursed and fought to tear his wand free of the webbing. Lying helpless on the ground, Ceria gulped a few times. It didn’t\nfeel\nlike her throat was perforated.\n“[Flashfire].”\nThe thick webbing burned off of Ceria in an instant, giving off thick, billowing clouds of smoke. She yelped and cursed as the fire burned her. But in moments, the webbing was gone.\nShe stood up and unsheathed her belt dagger. Ceria ran to Gerial and Sostrom, working her blade into the webbing. It stuck.\nShe pulled the dagger away and pointed at it. A stream of fire burst from her fingers and engulfed the blade, turning it red-hot. Ceria began cutting again, and the webbing fell away.\nGerial yelped as the heated blade burned him, but Ceria yanked him to his feet.\n“Complain later. Let’s go! If the Watch catches us—”\nAll three adventurers exchanged a look. They looked around the street. Sostrom pointed to an alleyway, and they ran as the Watch arrived on the scene, led by an irate Drake with a spear.",

    "text": "“We were under a spell?”\nCeria nodded as she, Sostrom, and Gerial walked back towards the inn. She winced with every step. Her skin was red and burned along her entire body. Only where her enchanted robes had covered her was her skin whole.\nSostrom fished out a potion and handed it to her as they walked. None of the adventurers slowed down, though. The commotion hadn’t spread to the rest of the city, but they had no desire to get on the wrong side of the Watch.\n“Yeah. She was casting a [Charm] spell with her eye. It hit both of you the instant you looked at her. I barely blocked it.”\n“But she was only looking at us.”\n“Gazers can cast spells as easily as looking. A half-Gazer can do the same, it seems.”\n“A half-Gazer? Is that what she was?”\nCeria glanced sideways at Gerial. The man was still pale from their encounter—and the magic that had worn off on him.\n“You didn’t know she was half-Gazer? Seriously, Gerial?”\n“I only know the basics. She’s a Named-rank.\nAnd she served the King of Destruction.\nWhat more do you need from me?”\nHe felt that covered everything you needed to ever know about Gazi. Ceria muttered darkly to herself as she rubbed the ointment over her burns.\n“There’s a lot more to it than that, Gerial. She’s one of the Seven—and she was famous for killing every single [Spy], [Assassin], [Saboteur], and [Rogue] she ever ran into during his wars. Of all of them, she could be called the scariest. Let’s get something to drink back at the inn. I’ll tell you all about it as soon as we get clear of the area.”\n“Tell us now. If she’s after us—”\n“Not us. She wants Ryoka, and I don’t know why. Possibly the same reason Magnolia is interested in her, but that’s just a guess. It spells trouble, and we need to let everyone know as soon as possible.”\n“Give us the details on Gazi before we get there. How strong is she? Where does she come from?”\nThis came from Sostrom, and Gerial was so amazed that the [Mage] didn’t know…\nBut Ceria nodded. They were all on different pages, so she decided to start from the beginning. She took a deep breath as she walked. The pain from her burns was easing, but she was still shaky. But an adventurer was calm or she was dead. So she collected her thoughts and spoke.\n“I’ll tell you two from the beginning so we’re not making mistakes in the future. Right. Sostrom, do you know about the desert continent south or maybe south-west of here? Chandrar?”\n“Too basic, Ceria.”\n“Okay, okay. It’s huge, but there are several kingdoms to note. Like Nerrhavia’s Fallen, the largest Stitch-folk kingdom in the world. But there’s one that you definitely heard about—even if you don’t know Gazi. Everyone knew that kingdom, once. In one of them sleeps a king…”",

    "text": "“Good evening, Erin.”\nErin blinked at Gazi.\n“Oh hi, Gazi. What’s up?”\nGazi smiled at Erin. She didn’t come in, although Erin held the door open for her.\n“I won’t trespass here long. I just wished to tell you I will be travelling from this city for a while.”\n“Oh?”\n“I have business to attend to elsewhere. I just wished to know if you planned on travelling anywhere in the coming weeks.”\nErin blinked. Some people were strange. Gazi appeared on her doorstep and asked—she was staring quite hard at Erin with her huge eye. But maybe that was just how half-Gazers were.\n“Nah. I’m not going anywhere in a hurry. Why?”\nGazi studied her with her central eye and then smiled.\n“I was just curious. I would greatly enjoy having another meal here at a later date, and I would not wish for you to leave before then.”\nErin laughed.\n“No chance of that, I’m afraid.”\n“Well then. Until we meet again.”\nGazi stepped back, smiling. Erin stared at her, nonplussed. Gazi turned and paused. Someone was in her way.\n“Excuse me.”\nCalruz blinked down at Gazi. The large Minotaur had clearly not been intending to stop, preferring perhaps to run Gazi over or let her move aside, but when he saw her face, his hooves stopped dead in their tracks.\nThe Minotaur’s eyes fixed on Gazi’s large eye, and his eyes widened in recognition. He instantly made room for her to walk past him, giving Gazi a lot of space. She brushed past him with her faint smile.\n“Your pardons, warrior.”\nCalruz stared at her back as she left. He turned to Erin.\n“Do you know her?”\n“Sort of. Why?”\nCalruz stared at Erin, back at Gazi’s disappearing figure, and shook his head.\n“She looked like—it is nothing. You would likely not know her as an Izrilian.”\nErin felt a little insulted at that, but she didn’t correct the Minotaur’s error. He snorted, rubbed at his face, and stomped into the inn, nearly running her over. She hopped back and eyed Calruz. His eyes were bloodshot, and he looked tired.\n“Well, can I help you, Mr. Grumpy?”\n“Food. Drink. I will have both.”\nHe\ndidn’t seem to care if she was sick. Erin sighed, walked into her kitchen, and got Calruz a sandwich. He eyed the hefty slices of ham and cheese packed between two flimsy pieces of bread, but devoured the meal without complaint. Then he sat back and eyed her.\nErin stared back. It was quite silent in her inn. Rags had left after losing to Erin several times, and Toren was busy cleaning dishes.\n“Um. Nice day, isn’t it? I haven’t gone outside much, but I assume it’s nice.”\nCalruz kept staring at her. Erin shifted in her seat. It was\nvery\nquiet.\n“It’s not a bad day when there are no monsters killing you, right?”\nHe kept staring. She avoided his gaze.\n“It’s not raining, at least.”\n“You should have fought.”\nErin glanced up at Calruz. The Minotaur was still staring at her with bloodshot eyes.\n“Excuse me?”\n“You. You should have fought.”\n“Fought…who?”\n“Last night. You went out to avenge the insect. You did not. But you should have fought.”\nErin opened her mouth and closed it for a second.\n“You mean Pawn and Ksmvr. I didn’t go out to fight.”\n“You did not.”\nCalruz agreed. He shifted in his seat and put his elbows on his knees as he faced her.\n“But you should have. It was a matter of honor. If you cared for the one called Pawn, you should have fought to protect him.”\n“Um.”\nErin didn’t know what to say. Where had this come from? But Calruz was direct and as blunt as…his giant axe would be if it met her face. Well, not that blunt. She’d met chess players like him.\n“I’m sorry, but fighting would have been prett—\nreally\nstupid. I would have lost and gotten chopped up.”\n“That is immaterial.”\n“Um. No it’s not. I don’t want to die.”\nHe snorted at her. Erin almost expected to see steam coming out of his nose.\n“Those who believe they will lose before battle begins have already lost.”\n“Yeah, but I\nknow\nI would have lost. That guy you wanted me to fight? Ksmvr? He hit me once, and I was seeing stars for an hour. He’s a warrior. I’m—not.”\n“If you are not a warrior, you should become one. It is unbefitting for a female to be alone and not be a warrior.”\nThis conversation had taken another right-angle turn into weirdness. Erin tried to come up with a response.\n“I have a skeleton. For…protection.”\nToren poked his head out of the kitchen. Calruz glanced at him and snorted.\n“It is worthless. Weak.”\nFor some reason, Erin thought Toren looked insulted, but skeletons didn’t have emotions, did they?\n“Well—I, uh, I can fight too. If I really have to. I’ve got [Bar Fighting] as a skill, you know.”\nCalruz stared blankly at Erin. She blushed.\n“I can fight. But I don’t want to pick fights I know I’ll lose. Look, this Ksmvr guy has levels in some kind of warrior class, right? He’d kill me if I fought.”\n“There is more to strength than mere levels.”\n“Yeah, but I’m not a Minotaur. I don’t have muscle. Or horns for poking people.”\nCalruz rolled his eyes towards the roof.\n“I refer to\nSkills\n.”\n“Yeah, like I said, I’ve got one. And, uh, [Lesser Strength]. Forgot that.”\n“That is not what I meant. I mean Skills for combat.”\nErin stared at Calruz with such complete incomprehension in her eyes that he seemed taken aback.\n“You…do not know?”\n“About what? Skills?”\n“Activated skills. Combat skills.”\n“…Noooooooo.”\nHe blinked at her. Then Calruz stood up.\n“Follow me.”",

    "text": "“Observe. This is my Skill.”\nCalruz pointed to the rock he’d found on the ground. It was a good-sized boulder that came up to Erin’s waist. She blinked at it and then at his axe.\n“Won’t that break?”\n“No.”\nCalruz raised the massive battleaxe over his head like a woodcutter about to split a log. But then he spoke. Or rather—roared. Erin jumped as he brought the axe down.\n“\n[Hammer Blow]!\n”\nThe axe met the rock, and the next thing Erin knew, Toren had tackled her to the ground. All was confusion as the thunderous impact stopped ringing in her ears and her bones. When Erin got up, she saw the boulder was rubble.\nAs in—a few split fragments of stone were all that remained at the impact site. The rest of the rock had split and shattered into a million pieces. Erin blinked at the rock and then at Carluz’s axe.\n“Oh.\nThat’s\nwhat you meant by Skills.”\n“Yes. It is my sole Skill.”\n“And it’s, uh—wow.”\nErin stared at the boulder.\n“Wow. Wow. Uh.\nWow.\n”\nCalruz seemed happy that she was impressed. He stuck the battleaxe in the earth and pointed to it.\n“That is what you should learn. Skills. If you must be alone, you must not be unprotected. You must fight.”\n“But I’m not a warrior. I mean, I don’t have a class—”\nCalruz snorted at Erin.\n“Immaterial. Classes, levels, these are just additions. What you lack is the soul of the warrior. You must have it. A female must not be alone without the power to defend herself. The singer must not be silenced. You must be stronger.”\nHe pointed at Erin with a finger twice as wide as her own.\n“I have decided this. I will teach you starting tomorrow. There are two days remaining before I go into the Ruins. I will have you learn to at least fight properly until then.”\nErin opened her mouth. She stared at the splintered rock and at Calruz.\n“Um. Okay. Thank you.”\nHe nodded.\n“I will rest now. My party will come soon. They must have food. See to it.”\n“Uh—”\nCalruz stomped towards the inn. Erin watched him go. She stared at the boulder. Slowly, she edged towards it.\nThe rock wasn’t warm from the impact. But it\nwas\nsharp. Erin cut her finger.\n“Ow.”\nShe stared at the blood, then heard a scuffling sound. She looked around and saw Toren next to the battleaxe Calruz had embedded in the earth.\nThe skeleton was pulling and heaving at the battleaxe stuck in the dirt as hard as it could. The heavy blade didn’t budge.\nErin sighed. She watched the skeleton as it scrabbled for purchase, pushing its feet into the grass as it tried to uproot the weapon.\n“That’s just so\nsad\n.”",

    "text": "Weak.\nCalruz thought the word aloud as he lay in his room and on the two beds Erin had pushed together for him. It was something he had never had to think about.\nBut she was weak. Pitifully weak. Normally, that was fine. He expected that of Humans. But she—\nShe was\noffensively\nweak. And it was wrong. It bothered Calruz. She should not be so weak. She had no right being so weak. Because there was something in her that demanded strength.\nHe was thinking about Erin. Or was it Ryoka? Either or. No—the Runner was strong. She was just not a warrior. She had to learn honor. Once she did, she would be a true warrior. If she gained levels, she would be worthy.\nBut Erin Solstice was different. Even now, Calruz could remember the music. It haunted him. It was wrong. It made him—\nWeak? Weaker? It was not the music of his home. There were no pounding drums, no voices raised for battle. It was not strong music. But neither was it weak.\nIt was unique. And it should be protected. But she was weak. So she had to be stronger.\nCalruz shifted in his bed, ignoring the groaning wood. She had to be stronger. If she were to perish, he would regret it. To let an innocent life end because of inaction was the worst strike against his honor. He would teach her.\nBut of course, it wasn’t Erin that Calruz wanted to teach. But she would be good—practice, yes. She was female. Ryoka was female. He would learn how to deal with Human females. Because at least one—two of them were worthy of respect. For different reasons.\nA tanned face appeared in Calruz’s mind, and he saw a quick form dashing away from him. A bird, tethered to the ground. A hunting raptor seeking a home.\nBeautiful. Fierce. And she had proper breasts, not like the small-mammaried females he kept running across.\nHe wondered where she was right now.\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "The sky always looked redder here. Whether it was the air taking something from the ground or the very nature of the land altering the atmosphere itself—\nEven the clouds over the Bloodfields that separated the north from the south looked tinged by ichor. Reddened, like the earth itself, by blood.\nNot just blood from a single battle or even a dozen battles or a hundred. This place had seen oceans of blood. Soldiers by the hundreds of thousands. It had probably buried millions of corpses over the long centuries of war. After all, it was here that north and south met every year for war.\nHow long ago the conflict had started, the [Merchant] didn’t know. Only that her father had talked about the Bloodfields as having been there as long as the Five Families. After the first wars had brought down Walled Cities and forced the Drakes and Gnolls to the south past the High Passes, the gigantic mountain range that divided the continent, armies had pushed each other back and forth, often spilling into north and south and destroying cities.\nAt some point, her father had told her that [Lords] of various families had petitioned the five great families of the north—Reinhart, El, Veltras, Terland, and Wellfar—along with the remaining Walled Cities—Manus, Zeres, Fissival, Oteslia, Salazsar, and Pallass—to relegate the fighting to one spot to prevent civilian deaths.\nThe Bloodfields, south of the Drake city of Liscor, had been chosen as that battleground after much debate. So—every year, for centuries, perhaps thousands of years by now, armies went to this spot to fight. Sometimes just token forces—other times entire wars in earnest. The fighting might spill forth after that, but this was where it so often began.\nHere was the thing. The [Merchant] gazed grimly at the red grass, the red\nsoil,\nand the deceptively flat ground that filled the valley and only route north. The caravan of wary [Traders] and [Merchants] were one of two groups on the road—they had seen no other travellers since they passed Hectval, and it would be rare to travel until winter snow fell in earnest. Despite the hazards of snow and the wretched travel conditions—this cold fall was pushing it.\n“We might be too early. Are we too early?”\nA nervous Drake was scanning the Bloodfields with an enchanted spyglass. He was Tellgre ‘Twodeals’. All his customers had learned that the Drake refused to let them purchase just one item. Hence his dubious claim to fame.\nHe was a Level 22 [Trader], and the Human woman walking beside a line of packhorses carrying her share of the caravan hadn’t yet managed to tell him he needed a better name and business model. Then again—she was a Human in Drake lands still, and she thought she’d leave that up to the others.\nA Human. The first time the woman had come to Drake lands, she’d passed through the Bloodfields, of course; the only other ways were the even\nmore\ndangerous routes through the High Passes or sea travel. Winter was safe enough…but she’d heard from travellers that it was Drakes who’d decided on the Bloodfields as the yearly battleground and forced the Humans to comply. She’d made the mistake of relating her father’s version of events and been given a cold shoulder the entire journey south.\nEach side had their own story. One of the things she’d learned after nearly a decade of trading both north and south of Izril was to shut up and listen. Or watch.\nSo—the Human [Merchant] said nothing as Tellgre chattered. She just looked across the red expanse. The crimson grass did fade slightly and turn green around the edges of the Bloodfields. Then again—some of the yellow or purple patches might not be the grass changing with the seasons. Maybe the Bloodfields were expanding?\n“Looks quiet. We’ll take the long way around.”\nThe Drake swung his eyes down to the woman as he lowered his spyglass. She saw his tongue flick out nervously as he licked his lips. He raised his voice—and she sensed more [Merchants], mostly Drakes, but also two Gnolls, glancing her way.\n“You’ve done this before, right, Ysara? It looks good to you, then? I’ve never done the Bloodfields run before.”\nYsara, who her colleagues and most of the South simply knew as the ‘Silver Merchant’, just shrugged in reply. She was a Level 34 [Merchant]. Far more successful than Tellgre and, honestly, most of the others in the caravan. Despite some having entire teams of [Guards] and assistant [Traders] as opposed to her being the lone member of her party—she had minimal overhead, and a few Chests of Holding carried all her goods.\nShe dealt, predictably, in silver. Often just silverware, but she also sold weapons and, interestingly, alchemical items. Silver was something [Alchemists] paid for too, after all. As proof of the fine metals she offered, Ysara had a single blade hanging at her belt, for self-defense.\nIt had an old, ornate handle of treated silver that wouldn’t tarnish, and it bore the silver Dragon and shield of her family.\nNot that any of the Drakes or Gnolls knew it by name. She doubted many cared. As far as they were concerned, she was just a Human. And she belonged to a minor noble house in the north, so it wasn’t anything to brag about. She was, technically, a [Lady] as well, but she didn’t level in that class.\nTo many Drakes and Gnolls she met, Ysara’s Humanity was the most fascinating part about her. The [Merchants] she was travelling with had been in her company for two months now, doing a circuit of cities trading their goods. They probably thought she was like most Humans. It might get funny once they got north.\nAfter all, Ysara’s hair was indigo, painted a rich shade of the color, and rarely faded thanks to a [Magical Painter] she knew. Better than dyes—and she had a long earring with a bead of red jade dressed in gold on one ear and a tattoo on one arm of a trellis of gold vines clinging to a silver ship.\nIn the north, she’d be taken for a [Sailor] if anyone. In the south—she was a Human. Actually, Ysara wondered if she should remove the indigo in her hair. She…exhaled as she stared across the Bloodfields.\nAn unpleasant journey, this. Almost as unpleasant as going home, a long task that took months. So rare, in fact, that it had been…five years? Five, at least, since she’d seen her family. One reason was the Bloodfields.\n“Calm down, Twodeals. The cold should have put the Bloodfields silent. If not—we’ll soon find out.”\nThat wasn’t exactly\ncomforting\ncoming from a senior [Merchant], Buleth, but no one should relax.\nThe Bloodfields were dangerous.\nYsara eyed the long, wide expanse of red grasses. She could see across the valley—but the Bloodfields weren’t just all red grass. Tall…trees…of pale white bark or something grew out of the ground in ten to twenty-foot spires.\nNo branches—just pale trunks. Were they trees at all? Well, they were called Watchertrees, and Ysara knew well what they did when active.\nHer skin crawled just looking at them—and at the bulbous, fungoid growths lining the Bloodfields. They clustered in huge pod-forests in places, much like mycelium, but unlike fungus, some of these plants could grow as tall as regular forests.\nThough…due to the cold, they were shrunken, silent, and, in theory, safe. Even so, the [Merchants] would be plotting a wide, wide course around the Bloodfields, across the edge of the valley where it rose into treacherous and inhospitable foothills.\nYou could try the foothills if you really had to get through the Bloodfields in the spring and summer, but good luck getting a horse or wagon through there without breaking a leg. Only Couriers like Hawk the Hare did any running like that—the [Merchants] had to pass near the Bloodfields.\n“Damn this grass. We had better not break an axle. At least I’ve got [Lightweight Wheels].”\nBuleth commented from his seat to Ysara, and she nodded.\n“I heard there used to be a trade route passing along here. Whatever happened to that?”\nThe Drake was portly, had a skullcap with holes for his neck-spines, and had ocre-red scales. He grunted sourly as he flapped the reins, and his horse plodded forwards, towing a large wagon. He dealt in spices, often imported from Chandrar and through the City of Waves, Zeres, which he brought to the rest of the continent for fine prices.\n“A road? If there was any, it’s long before our time. Probably before the Bloodfields expanded. Must have been swallowed up. Or abandoned.”\n“Right. Has it grown recently?”\n“Not much. Not much fighting of late. Tyrion Veltras comes down every year, but it’s not like the old wars. Then again, you’d know as much about that as I.”\nShe nodded and, again, checked the Bloodfields.\nHere was the thing—once upon a time, the ‘Bloodfields’ had just been a stretch of land where armies warred. Ordinary grass and dirt and rock. But after so much death, the land had…changed. Creatures, plants had begun to adapt to the blood and grow dangerous.\nSo dangerous that armies sometimes lost more [Soldiers] to the Bloodfields than their engagements.\nBut they came, to clear the Bloodfields of growths as well to kill each other. Sometimes, Ysara wondered which was more important. Because the Bloodfields spread. Slowly…but someday, future [Merchants] might have to dare the foothills to get north to Liscor. Or not go at all.\nIn the spring, even their wide course would have already attracted…attention. Even Buleth, a veteran, muttered to Ysara.\n“I don’t like the Watchertrees. I think we’re in range. How far do some of them reach?”\n“I’ve heard a thousand feet…”\nBoth stared at the spires of white.\n“I’ve heard longer. I suppose we’re safe. Dead gods and Ancestors, I\nhate\nthis commute. We should have gone later.”\nShe nodded.\n“—But we’ll be first north and have the best markup. That’s what\nyou\nsaid.”\nThe Drake hunched his shoulders.\n“I know, I know! Alright, let’s not spook the newbies. I’m surprised you came, though. You hate this route as much as I do.”\nYsara made a face. Her hand strayed to the hilt of her sword, and Buleth eyed it. Despite being silver, she had wrapped the hilt with sensible leather to get a grip. It was worn—and he knew she could use the sword well. As a child, Ysara had been told she had a once-in-a-thousand years talent with the blade. Even her brother had claimed that he couldn’t best her, and he was a [Knight]. Her sister…\n“My sister.”\n“Hm? Oh, right. House…er…you know, I never asked which one. Not the Five Families. Visiting the family?”\nYsara’s smile was crooked, but Buleth either didn’t notice the Human’s nuance or pretended not to.\n“I have to at least twice a decade, right? Besides, I heard something interesting is happening around Liscor. It’s just good business.”\nAnd that was all she had to say on her personal affairs. Buleth didn’t need anything more, and nodded understandingly. Ysara, privately, didn’t relish going home. She wondered if it would be as awkward as last time. But family was family…she inhaled and caught that curious scent of the Bloodfields. Not blood…but something else. Something alien and exotic and unsettling. She walked on at a good clip, ready for trouble and hoping for none.",

    "text": "The Bloodfields were always dangerous, but depending on the company you took, they could be safer. And frankly—with Ysara around, Buleth, the leader of this group, felt better.\nThough it occurred to him he didn’t know much about her outside her business. The [Merchant], Buleth, scratched at his chin as he slowly pulled out a puffed pastry of fried dough filled with Yellats and spices. Cheap and tasty. He broke it in half and offered her a bite, and she savored the taste in the cold air.\n“What’s she doing in Liscor? That remote backwater’s got nothing in it. Their army are useful mercenary bastards, but Liscor’s got the\nAntinium\n.”\nHe shuddered, and all the Drakes in earshot winced. Liscor was…unique. Most [Merchants] regarded it as safe—but not a place to linger. A place to go and see once, though, just to see an Antinium outside the Hivelands without the chance of being killed. Plus, it was the closest city to the Bloodfields.\n“I hear a dungeon’s popped up. My sister’s an adventurer.”\n“Oh! I thought your brother was?”\n“Him too. He’s Gold-rank. She’s Silver.”\nBuleth had to shake his head.\n“My, my. Your entire family really must be filled with high-level [Warriors].\nYou’re\nthe most dangerous [Merchant] I know. Which—come to mention it—can I ask you not to embarrass my [Guards], Ysara?”\nHe nodded at a few sulking figures trudging behind his wagons. They glared at Ysara when she wasn’t looking, and their leader looked especially mad. She sighed.\n“He challenged me to a duel, Buleth. I’m the lone [Merchant]. I have a reputation to keep up.”\n“Fair enough.”\nAnother glance at her sword. Ysara decided to thank him for the snack. She hefted the scabbard up and unhooked it from her belt.\n“Want to look if you’re so curious? I’ll sell your [Guards] blades at a discount.”\n“What good is silver in a sword? Mithril now…although, this is a\nfine\nblade.”\nBuleth eyed the sharp longsword appreciatively. Ysara smiled.\n“It’s beautiful and an alloy, so it doesn’t tarnish. Stronger than regular steel is my claim—and some monsters hate it. But truthfully? The [Smiths] who make this just know their craft better than some dunce with a hammer.”\n“Fair enough. And you get it from your home? They own mines or do they just have great smiths? I can see the crest. Very Drakish. Love the Dragon. Right out of the stories, eh?”\nBuleth glanced up and saw another odd smile from that woman, but she was a good, honest [Merchant], unlike some real bastards, and she was well-spoken of. Dead gods, the Golden Gnoll herself was friends with the Silver Merchant…no surprise given their names.\n“Actually? I get half of my arms from a Gnoll tribe. They just do the stamping with my crest. Heard of the Silverfangs? Their Gnolls are in Liscor.”\nBuleth wasn’t up to date on Plains Gnolls, the tribal ones, but he knew them from somewhere.\n“Ah, good sorts, I think. Not like Woven Bladegrass or…”\nHe hesitated and glanced at the Gnolls in the caravan. Maybe he shouldn’t say anything at all. They could get—touchy—and Drakes and Gnolls were not the best neighbors. Ysara filled in the rest for him.\n“Good, honest sorts. Like most Gnolls you could meet.”\nA Gnoll twenty-eight paces away snorted softly, and Buleth just\nbet\nhe’d heard. Their damn ears. He agreed with Ysara but then nodded ahead.\n“So—that group must be Silverfangs. I think I saw a few markings on them. Silver fang—like crescent? Biting teeth?”\n“That’s their logo. Interesting. So that’s a group of Silverfangs up there. Warriors, judging by how much they’re carrying.”\nYsara turned her attention to the only other people crossing the Bloodfields. Given the relatively flat ground until you rode up towards the Floodplains of Liscor, another basin, the caravan could see the group of eighteen Gnolls ahead. They were making better time than the [Merchants]; they had ten horses. It looked like they were switching on and off, rather than riding the whole way, and they were as vigilant as the [Merchants].\nOne had waved at the [Caravan Guardmaster], but they’d not indicated they wanted to meet up—not here. Maybe tonight? Though Buleth had every intention of trying to get past the Bloodfields in a single day. It was about…four days to Liscor? A Runner could do it a bit faster, but once today was over, he’d sleep easy.\nAside from bandits.\nWould some be crazy enough to raid? Hectval’s alliance didn’t patrol around here—Buleth glanced at Ysara.\n“How do you know they’re warriors? Could be just Plains Gnolls?”\nShe shook her head with calm authority.\n“Plains Gnolls might go armed, but shortbows for their non-fighters at most. That lot? I see a [Shaman], long spears, long\nbows\n—they’re not going to raid us, Buleth. Don’t worry.”\n“I never—”\nHe huffed and decided to give it up. Ysara knew trouble when she saw it. He sat back in his seat and decided he might try playing on the new chessboards he’d bought. He was going to try selling them; you had addicts all over Izril, and the game was new, if not as hot as when it came out. He had some lovely gemstone pieces he’d gotten from Salazsar for a song. His hope was a noble snapped up a board. Just one would recoup all costs.\nBuleth was about to challenge Ysara to a game when the woman made a sound. She put a hand over her brow, squinted, and his heart leapt.\n“Wait a second. Who’s that? Buleth, lend me your spyglass.”\n“What?\nWhat?\n”\nThe Drake scrambled for his spyglass and tossed it at Ysara. She caught it, put it to one eye, and exclaimed.\n“It looks like a Runner’s making the Bloodfields run!”\n“\nAncestor’s wrinkled tits, Ysara!\nDon’t give me a heart-attack!”\nThe Drake held a claw over his chest. He almost snapped at the Human woman, but Ysara didn’t give back the spyglass immediately.\n“I’m—huh. That’s odd.”\nNow that Buleth knew what to look for, he could see the distant,\ndistant\nspeck coming down the slopes that led to the Floodplains of Liscor. He grunted sourly.\n“Not just one. Looks like four. At least—I think I see four.”\nHe swore he’d just seen three figures on the lip of the hill—but maybe not. Ysara swung the spyglass up, but missed them. She was focused on the Runner.\n“Good speed on that Runner. Not horse-speed, but—City Runner for sure. She? Nice hips either way.”\nBuleth brightened up a bit. He coughed to hide his reaction to that—Ysara sometimes made comments that the woman clearly didn’t realize a hot-blooded male Drake like he could take the wrong way. Or right way.\nHe was suddenly more interested in meeting this Human, but Ysara was frowning mightily.\n“What’s so odd? Even Runners probably risk the Bloodfields run.”\n“Yes…but she’s going straight down the center. Is she mad or did no one tell her—the Bloodfields can still be dangerous even in the cold!”\nThen Buleth’s head snapped up. He saw the dot moving straight down the valley, and as Ysara said—the Runner was going\nstraight\ndown the center.\nIf she kept going, she’d end up in the Bloodfields. Ysara looked up at Buleth, and he cursed.\n“No way a local Runner doesn’t know about the Bloodfields, Ysara. I bet this one will turn right or left.”\n“Maybe. Or…maybe she’s from Celum. How well do you think the locals know the Bloodfields there? Maybe she’s on a big contract—where are the horses?”\nYsara looked around, and Buleth saw her striding off. She turned and tossed him the spyglass. He nearly pitched off his seat trying to grab it and called out after her.\n“She has to know, Ysara! Don’t go racing off suddenly—the Bloodfields react to sound and movement!”\n“It’s cold! And I won’t—as long as she swerves!”\nThe woman called back. Buleth shook his head as he put the spyglass to his eyes and watched the distant Human. He murmured to himself.\n“Ooh. I see what Ysara means. She’s definitely not going to run through the Bloodfields, though.”\nNo one was that crazy. The Drake watched the Human running forwards. And then he glanced up.\n“Four Runners? What are the odds?”",

    "text": "Ryoka Griffin felt like someone was holding her hand and pulling her. Pulling her so hard she couldn’t help but stumble forwards. An inexorable rip-tide—and unlike a person, she couldn’t yank free of that pull.\nShe felt that if she didn’t run—she’d fall flat on her face. That kind of tugging. Only, it wasn’t physical, it was in her head.\nA blind rush forwards, and a goal in the back of her mind. Three days. Three days of running since Esthelm. Or—four?\nShe didn’t know. She only knew that she slept, ate, peed, screamed murder at birds, blasted angry music through her earbuds—\nAnd heard the voice.\nFind the Necromancer. Find Az’kerash. Deliver the letter.\nThat was her task. That was her—what she\nhad\nto do. No question. No doubt. Her pride as a Runner, her commitment to her promises—it was like taking that and adding a second layer of certainty to it.\nI’ve been put under a spell.\nShe was aware…that the mysterious half-Elf [Mage] had made her do this. But so what? She didn’t care.\nShe had nothing left behind her. Only smoke from all her burned bridges and shame. That was what made her run faster.\nShame.\nFour days, and Ryoka still felt the impact of punching Yvlon in the face. She still saw Ceria staring at her looking so—disappointed. It burned straight through her. She had never, ever felt this—\nNo. Ryoka Griffin slowed as she crested a hill of grass and saw something odd in front of her. A red stain spreading out in a vast valley of grass. Fall’s cold air whipped at her raven-black hair, and she brushed sweat from her forehead and took a drink of water. Then the magic and guilt and shame pushed her forwards.\nIt was a beautiful red stain that looked—wrong. The longer she stared, the more it unsettled the young woman. But she didn’t run away from it.\nIt was like her. It should have been beautiful—red grass and strange plants she wanted to stare at when she got closer. She knew it was dangerous—but the old mage had said it was where the Necromancer could be found. Here—no, along the mountainside, right?\nIt didn’t matter. The Bloodfields were a wretched stain on the earth, not something marvelously unique.\nLike her. A disaster. It didn’t really belong—and Ryoka Griffin ran straight and narrow down the valley. It was a beautiful day, and the sky looked deep blue…or purplish in places. The few clouds there were had some kind of orange tint to the undersides.\nA magical day. A magical world. But—",

    "text": "I am the same. It’s not them, it’s me.\nI did it. I went to another world. I went to Narnia, like the Lion, Witch, and the Wardrobe. I got a magic quest.\nMy parents? Gone. My past? Unknown. I could be anyone I wanted to be, and it’s happening again.\nDisaster. People I’ve let down. As I run, I feel the pain in my lungs from pushing myself. My legs and arms are tired—and I keep running, keep pushing it.\nI like the feeling of running, of giving it all up to the pumping of my arms and legs, the rush of blood. That’s pure. That’s—better than thinking.\nBut this time, I can’t escape it. My guilt.\nI’ve done this before.\nIt falls in my head, louder than the voice telling me to find the Necromancer, louder than the screaming that I’m such a fool, louder—\nLouder than the voice telling me to go back and apologize.\nIt’s not too late. Go back. Go back and apologize. Please. They were so good to you.\nI know. I fucking\nknow.\nPlease stop. But the voices never stop. This is all me, of course. I’m just—separating them out. Perspectives.\nLike warring demons in my chest. The first one is sad. Because—it knows, like I do, that this is all my fault.\nI’ve done this before. I’ve had friends before this. Of course I have. Or were they ever my friends?\nNo, they weren’t. They just wanted to hang out with the senator’s daughter. State senator, comes from money, and they thought I was like them. Fuck them. Fuck Fals. And Garia. And Persua. AND PERSUA. And—\nThe Horns? I snap out of the fury filling me. That’s the third voice, I guess. Did my therapist—well, one of them—ever talk about that? My anger?\nI’ve had a lot of therapists. A lot of therapy. Medications—and a lot of my parents pushing off my problems onto someone else to handle it. I—hate each and every one of them.\nHated? I’ll never see them again. I hope not. After all, the last one I think I literally threw a chair at. And hit.\nMy fault. Why did I do that? The poor woman wasn’t doing anything. She just wanted to help me.\nFuck her too with a rusted pickaxe.\nThe voices. I run faster, try to put more energy into my legs. I almost manage to drown them out—but I can’t sustain this pace. I’ve been drinking stamina and healing potions on and off—it helps me keep at max speed—but I don’t dare waste too many.\nWhy not? Why not pull out my ‘reward’ for doing all this? Not the gold, the wand of flames or whatever that guy gave me. Plus—a Potion of Haste?\nFire and speed. Sounds fun. The wand is supposed to be for the Bloodfields or self-defense? I’ve been tempted to try it out—and the potion. I want to. Imagine running even faster? I want to—but I need to save it.\nSo I just run, and the voices catch up. This time, it’s maudlin that sounds loudest. Maudlin guilt.\nI’ve done it again. Why did I attack the Horns?\nCalruz was arrogant. That bastard.\nThey cured my leg. My\nleg.\nI would have never walked again with that leg. Why did I hit him in the balls and try to beat him to a pulp?\nYvlon was a smug bitch…\nNo, she\nwasn’t.\nCeria told me the truth. She put everything on the line for me, and I punched her. Why did I do that?\nThen—silence. Because I really don’t have a good reason.\nNo, that’s a lie too. I know exactly why. I’ve done this before. Why…why can’t I be a good person?\nBecause I don’t deserve nice things. Fuck me too. This is what I do. Another world won’t change it. I hate me. I hate everything.\nAnd when I get to that, my thoughts are in agreement. I just wanted to run. Why did it have to be so complicated? Magnolia. This is all her fault. No, Persua. Fals.\nOr me.\nAnd there it is. I keep running, straight for the Bloodfields. Necromancer. Deliver it. Keep silent about the man in the High Passes.\nI want to go back and say sorry. But I’ve never said sorry and meant it.\nI mean it.\nI’m sorry, Ceria. Why did I do that?\nYvlon made me angry.\nI thought I was happy, lately. I really did. My eyes are stinging, and I’m trying not to cry. Because that would be stupid. What do I have to cry about? Or rather, why start?\nI’d never stop.\nIt’s not my fault. I keep hearing that refrain, a thousand times. Magnolia. That damn [Assassin]. Persua. And I agree, even now. There are so many assholes.\n—But it hits me. Like a blast of wind in the face. A bucket of cold water. A realization, so complete and so simple I can’t describe it. Perhaps I thought this before, but now I realize it with all my heart and soul.\nThere have always been good reasons. Explanations for why things went sideways or bad. Here I am, running south on what might be a suicide mission.\nAnd I don’t really care about that. I’m—almost excited to see what this Bloodfields is like. But I can’t concentrate. Because I feel guilty. I almost want the Horns to never speak to me again. Yet I owe them.\nI owe them, and this is how I repaid them?\nMagnolia. Persua. Fals. Calruz. Yvlon. There’s a common thread between them all. Maybe some of it was for the best. I don’t know. But here I am. How did I get here? I have no answers. Just observations. And what I see is…\nIt’s me.\nIt’s always been me.",

    "text": "It was written all over her face. She probably had no idea what her face looked like. Close to tears, stubbornly refusing to cry. But also—\nAs she ran down towards that blight in the world, the Bloodfields—her eyes focused on the strange trees. On the prickle down her spine like a [Dangersense] every person possessed. Her instincts telling her to turn around or run past it, not through it.\nShe still kept coming. Because those eyes were hungry. If she wasn’t stopped, she would have gone straight into the center of that place.\nShe was less than a thousand paces from where the grass began to change when the young woman finally seemed to hear Ysara shouting at her.\n“\nMiss! Miss!\n”\nIn her defense—as the City Runner slowed, Ysara, panting and riding full-tilt on the snorting stallion, saw the Human woman pulling something out of her ears. A dangling bit of string? What kind of thing was that? Something to help her hear?\nIt certainly hadn’t done that. Half the [Merchants] had joined Ysara in shouting, standing up in their stirrups or on the wagons to shout—even the Gnolls that Ysara had just passed were howling long notes of warning.\n“Huh? What?\nWhat?\n”\nThe first reaction of the young woman was pure surprise. It crossed her dusky features, and Ysara realized she really\nhadn’t\nheard. Incredible. But the second reaction was instant and surprising hostility.\nThe Silver Merchant, panting, slowed her horse to a canter and hesitated a second. She looked at Ryoka, then pointed a hand.\n“The Bloodfields. You nearly ran straight into it.”\n“Huh?”\nIt was clear that the young woman was coming back to earth after being miles, miles away. She focused her eyes on the red grass—which Ysara happened to know was\nsharp\n—and the young woman was barefoot!\nAlready a sign she was odd—if her features didn’t already mark her as distinctly Drathian. Which could explain it, but Ysara had heard Drathians had their own language. This young woman had a perfect command of the common tongue. And her look was changing into severe annoyance.\n“The Bloodfields? I know it’s the Bloodfields. It’s…”\nShe stared across the vast expanse, and her eyes didn’t even reach the end of it, Ysara knew. Her caravan had camped at the safest distance from the Bloodfields last night, then set out. By evening, they were close to the end of it, but this young woman might be forced to camp next to this place.\nAnd it was not\nthat\nsafe.\n“You were about to run straight into it. That’s madness. You won’t survive. Didn’t anyone warn you?”\nYsara was glad now she’d started riding so early. The young woman just blinked at her.\n“It’s dangerous. A…‘death zone’?”\n“Yes.”\nSilence. Ysara\nknew\nshe was being understood, but the young woman just stared at the crimson land ahead, eyed one of the dormant Watchertrees, and nodded.\n“I’ve got business here. Or past here. Thanks for the warning. See ya.”\nAnd she tried to keep running.\nYsara actually put her horse in the young woman’s way, and affronted, the Runner stopped. Ysara’s smile was far more strained this time.\n“Excuse me, Miss. Perhaps you didn’t hear me. The Bloodfields are right there. If you go in—you’ll die. Even being this close to them is dangerous!”\nShe had no [Dangersense], but again, she didn’t need it. The Runner looked at Ysara. She spoke slowly, as if reluctant to waste any more words.\n“I know.”\nAnd she tried to edge around the horse. The animal actually put its head out to stop her, and Ysara held out a hand.\n“Miss—what’s your name? Are you a City Runner?”\nReluctantly, for a third time, the young woman stopped and spoke.\n“Ryoka Griffin. City Runner around the Celum region. On delivery. I’m not taking requests or mail.”\nShe recited it by rote, and Ysara smiled desperately, although by now\nshe\nwas getting peeved.\n“Celum? I know the area quite well. Have you been to Wales? Remendia? Do you live there?”\n“I run there. But I’m working. So…”\nYsara exhaled.\n“Miss Ryoka Griffin. Please—[Hear Me Out].”\nRyoka Griffin’s feet stopped as she tried to take a step, and her head turned. Ysara saw the angry look and knew she had upset the young woman. But it was a Skill a [Merchant] got—a kind of final offer, even if it irked your client.\nShe didn’t like using it like this, but she had gotten the Skill to try and ram concepts into even the most thick-headed fools. Which had been family…\nAnyways, the Silver Merchant spoke very calmly.\n“The Bloodfields are a death zone. You know this, Miss Griffin? Gold-rank adventurers fear to tread there. Named-ranks would think twice and need a reason to go in. Armies may cross the Bloodfields, but they do it with fire and sword ahead of them. Only in the fall and winter is it remotely safe—\nand not if you go straight into it.\nI stopped you because I wanted to warn you that it was certain death. Suicide. Do you…understand me? Don’t go in there.”\nShe didn’t know how to say it plainer. Even her idiot brother would have gotten that. And the Runner, Ryoka Griffin, understood Ysara. In fact, her jade green eyes lit up a bit. In…excitement?\nA wild kind of yearning. A strange exhilaration.\nThen Ysara recognized it. She had seen it in real adventurers, in Couriers she had met. When she had visited The Adventurer’s Haven, the most famous inn of all of Izril, the guests there had looked like that.\n“I understand. You don’t want me to go in there?”\n“Yes.”\nThe City Runner stared at Ysara. The [Merchant] held her gaze. Ryoka Griffin walked sideways and began to jog forwards.\nSilver and steel!\nYsara bit back an oath as she turned her horse to trot alongside Ryoka. Even her horse was trying to shy away from the Bloodfields.\n“Miss—”\n“I heard you. Thanks for the warning. Don’t go in, right?”\nThis time, the young woman gave Ysara a distinctly taunting, defiant look, and Ysara began to feel…nostalgic.\nOh no.\nThis reminded her a bit of—herself. And in her experience…Ysara gritted her teeth, trying to sound friendly.\n“Miss Ryoka. May I say something else?”\nThe Runner slowed.\n“What now?”\n“…\nDo\ngo into the Bloodfields. It’s perfectly safe. And everyone would want you to do that.”\nYsara indicated the [Merchants], who were still watching them, and the Gnolls. A few of them were waving down at her, as if wondering if she needed help or if Ryoka was crazy. Ryoka’s eyes flicked. She stared at Ysara’s insincere smile.\n“I think I might just do that.”\nShe turned, began to speed up—and Ysara kicked her in the shoulder as she rode past. Hard. Ryoka stumbled, whirled—and Ysara was already leaping down, shouting.\n“\nBuleth! I need help!\n”\nThe Drake had already seen, and several [Guards] were riding her way, fast. Ryoka balled her fists, but Ysara had a hold of her shoulder.\n“Let go of—”\n“\nI am trying to stop you from getting killed.\nListen to sense!”\nThe two women began wrestling, and unfortunately—the Runner knew some kind of wrestling tricks because she nearly\ntossed\nYsara onto the ground. Only Ysara’s brief career as an adventurer saved her. She clung to Ryoka as the horse snorted and trotted around them.\n“Why are you trying to get yourself killed?”\n“\nNone of your business! Get lost!\n”\n“It is if you set off the Bloodfields—stop!”\nRyoka was dragging the two of them into the grass. Ysara saw the green turning crimson—and the first blades of the Bloodfields that Ryoka stepped on made the Runner freeze.\n“Ow. What the—”\nRyoka stared at the red scratches on her feet—and then the grass. It had cut her feet up! It wasn’t…\nsolid\n, but it was edged. So you’d bleed if you rolled around, but surface cuts. Like the worst paper cuts imaginable. That had to hurt. She looked at Ysara, and the Silver Merchant expected this to be enough. But Ryoka just tried to tear free.\n“Let go of me.\nNow.\n”\nHer hand curled, and Ysara braced herself.\n“I want to help you.”\nFor some reason, that was apparently the worst thing to say, because the young woman’s eyes flashed. She raised her hand and threw a punch.\n“Maybe I don’t want any\nhelp!\n”\nIn the moment before the punch landed, Ysara thought Ryoka’s face turned from wrath to guilt in a flash. The woman was braced—but the punch never hit her.\nIt was surely impossible. Impossible for the two struggling figures to have been caught unawares in the relatively flat ground. Impossible for anyone to close the distance that fast—no normal person could do it.\nBut the four-fingered gauntlet that caught Ryoka’s arm belonged to no ordinary woman. The giant eye that glowed with yellow and shifted colors as Ysara’s head turned and the four miniature eyes that spun and the sharp teeth that opened into a smile—\nThose belonged to a legend.\nGazi Pathseeker, Gazi the Omniscient, Named-rank adventurer and…one of the King of Destruction’s Seven caught Ryoka’s arm in a grip that stopped it dead. She smiled—as Ryoka and Ysara whirled to look at her.\n“Hello. Am I disturbing you?”",

    "text": "“You must be mad. Why would you want to run through the Bloodfields?”\nThat was what Buleth said to break the tense silence. Gnolls, [Merchants]—Drakes mostly—Ysara, Gazi, and Ryoka were all camped well west of the edge of the Bloodfields. Astonishingly close as they hadn’t cleared the final section, but Gazi made even the Bloodfields’ threat recede in everyone’s mind.\nThe Gnolls\nwere\nSilverfangs. They’d introduced themselves as such and were heading to Liscor. They were quite friendly, and their leader had a beautiful longbow with hand-fletched arrows, all red as a cherry.\n“Roc’s feathers. A single one cut up can make a quiver. They fly better—though you’d best take care in how you cut the feather up. Az’muzarre gifted our tribe a feather from their great bird.”\nThe Gnoll was speaking to one of the [Guards], and Ysara was fascinated by that, but all eyes were on Ryoka. And the Runner—shrugged.\n“I have a delivery. My destination is around the Bloodfields. Going through seemed easy.”\nShe was giving Gazi a long, appraising stare as they sat around, talking. A wide-eyed not-quite glower that…was a mistake. Because the Named-rank adventurer just returned the look. And she had three more eyes.\nGazi Pathseeker stared at Ryoka Griffin with her main eye so long the young woman was forced to finally look away. Which was in and of itself commendable, because she had tried to stare down the most famous half-Gazer in the world.\nShe managed two whole minutes before she had to blink—then she kept her gaze on Gazi. Until the\npressure\nmade Ryoka wilt. That took another three minutes.\nAnd not once did Gazi blink. She didn’t seem—angry. Not like the staring contests of adventurers or swords-for-hire that Ysara had seen now and then. That was really a children’s game between adults. Gazi didn’t need to play that game to prove anything.\nThat sword had claimed more lives than any weapon she had ever sold.\nThe claymore on Gazi’s back had shed enough blood to grow a miniature Bloodfields. She…she would have made murderers and Roshal’s lot walk soft around her.\nIt said a lot that even if Ryoka didn’t know all about Gazi, she should surely have sensed it, and she had tried, despite it all, to out-stare Gazi. Yet, it was the Gazer who was most supportive of Ryoka when all was said and done.\n“Easy. Ysara practically\ndrags\nyou away and you try to kill yourself? And us?”\nBuleth grumbled. But now that everyone was calm, Ryoka looked—embarrassed. And uncomfortable. Gazi was still staring at her.\n“Adventurer Pathseeker, thank you for the—help.”\nYsara tried to take that\nstare\noff Ryoka, and Gazi’s head turned—but her main eye rolled into the side of her head, and Ysara knew it was pointed at Ryoka. It seemed the Runner felt it, because she turned paler. She was sweating despite the chill in the air.\n“Merchant Ysara. You are welcome. I thought it was an interesting event. Though now…if Runner Griffin wishes to enter the Bloodfields, I say let her.”\nEveryone stared at Gazi. The Gnolls sniffed and glanced at each other and looked…concerned. Though everyone looked concerned by that statement.\n“Let her kill herself, you mean?”\nYsara managed a polite chuckle. Gazi didn’t quite smile, though her lips turned up.\n“If she is confident—let her make her choices. That is freedom. I have heard it said that a measure of Couriers and Gold-ranks is whether or not they can pass through the Bloodfields and live.”\nEveryone fell silent at that. Ysara had heard that too, but Buleth chuckled weakly.\n“Even Hawk the Hare wouldn’t try that, and he’s the closest Courier, Lady Pathseeker!”\n“He’s also a bit of a coward.”\nSomeone else muttered. Gazi just shrugged, rolling the armor on her shoulders. Her main eye finally looked away from Ryoka, and the young woman untensed, shakily relieved.\n“We cannot stop people from making their choices. And I think the outcome would be—interesting. We might all be surprised.”\nInteresting.\nMost people were focused on Gazi’s face, but Ysara had met her share of legends thanks to The Adventurer’s Haven and her family. Magnolia Reinhart, for one. And she knew something of tricks thanks to the Golden Gnoll.\nShe noticed Gazi’s big eye swing down and stare at…something on Ryoka’s belt?\nOdd.\nThen Gazi turned, and all\nfive\neyes stared Ryoka down.\nThe Named-rank legend either held a grudge or believed in stamping out challenges. She eyed Ryoka as the cold sweat resumed.\n“Though it is curious to meet you. What is your name, Runner, again? Where do you hail from? Such bravery isn’t often seen.”\n“I’m…Ryoka. From around Celum.”\n“And before that?”\nGazi smiled—until one of the Silverfang Gnolls sneezed. It sounded deliberate, but he raised a paw and brushed at the silver markings on his fur—the fangs as Buleth had claimed.\n“Hah! And I thought your name would be ‘Erin’, yes? Well met, brave Runner. Foolish of you to try the Bloodfields, but if you’re going south, perhaps head to the Great Plains? You’ll enjoy it with your bare paws—er, feet. And our tribes are welcoming to Humans. Those that don’t come with fire and sword.”\nHe grinned, and Gazi’s eyes de-focused on Ryoka. A small eye rolled into the side of her head and\nfixed\nthe Gnolls with a stare. It was unsettling…and covert. The half-Gazer turned her head to him and smiled, politely, as the Gnoll [Warrior] got to his feet. He passed by her, and one of her eyes kept following his face. The Gnoll shook Ryoka’s hand and Ysara’s.\n“Silver Merchant, we heard you did good business with our Chieftain. I am Chief Warrior Rometh.”\n“Please remember me to…Chieftain Akrisa and Shaman Cetrule. How is Cers doing? Satar?”\nYsara was grateful for [Contact Memory], which helped her remember her clients’ names. The Gnoll chuckled.\n“Worrying over her little sister, Krshia Silverfang. Who lives in Liscor. We’re bound there.”\n“That’s our stop as well. Would you like to go the rest of the way with us? It might be slow, but we’ll share a fire and food.”\nBuleth chimed in, possibly wanting both the favor of the Gnolls in Liscor and more protection. The Gnolls murmured, but to the Drake’s disappointment, the [Warrior] demurred.\n“We must go at best pace, but we will likely see you there, Merchant Buleth. Thank you for the kind offer. And for sharing this meal. But it is not wise to linger near the Bloodfields, yes? We will be heading out—but not if we are going to see this young Human lose her life in the next few minutes.”\nHe looked keenly at Ryoka, and she flushed.\n“I’ll survive. I’ve run the High Passes already.”\nThat\ngot everyone’s attention. Ysara suppressed a whistle despite herself. No wonder the young woman was confident!\nIt didn’t excuse her recklessness, though, or her attitude. But Gazi was trading pleasantries with a few [Guards], who begged her for a chance to see her blade or, even more,\nduel\nher. They had not a chance, Ysara knew. Most were below Level 20, and she could best them as a [Merchant]. She would never touch Gazi.\nThen the young woman burst out with something that provoked a real silence.\n“It’s no one’s business. Just let me do what I want. Even if I die—why do you care?”\nRyoka Griffin’s face was scarlet, and she flushed more when everyone looked her way. After a moment—Ysara stood up.\n“Perhaps I should try to talk to this young woman. Miss Griffin? Would you step over here?”\nShe indicated the back of Buleth’s wagon, and Ryoka hesitated, saw Gazi glancing at her, and got up. The Gazer stared at Ryoka and Ysara with her main eye even when they walked behind the wagon, but one of her smaller eyes was slowly,\nslowly\ntracing a route across the foothills behind the temporary camp. As if following something.\nThe other eyes? They were watching the Gnolls. And the Gnolls were watching her.\n“Liscor is a small city for a Named-rank adventurer to be in, Adventurer Gazi. Does something—interest you there? Such a legendary figure must be intimidating, to some, yes?”\nChief Warrior Rometh stretched out his legs around the fire, but some of the [Merchant]s’ guards realized that the Gnolls never sat or moved in a way that would leave them unguarded if they were attacked. Sensible around the Bloodfields—but they were staring at Gazi.\nThe half-Gazer’s smile had teeth—but the Gnoll’s fangs were just as sharp.\n“A small city for Gnolls of your level as well. A warrior above Level 30 like you…and your entire group is high-level as well. So many Silverfangs for a border city of the Drakes is odd. Yes?”\nShe mimicked the Gnoll’s way of speaking, and Buleth’s head spun.\nCould she read levels?\nHe’d heard some spells could do that—Rometh did not seem to appreciate Gazi’s insight. He snorted.\n“Spoken like one foreign to Izril. Liscor’s mercenary army is not ‘small’. They were encircling Oteslia last I heard, and that is a deed few armies in the world can manage. Even your King of Destruction stopped at Zeres.”\nThat\nsilenced the rest of the low-level conversations around the fire, not that there had been much. Gazi’s five eyes slowly fixed on Rometh, one by one.\n“He never set foot on Izril himself. We sent one of seven against a Walled City, Gnoll. Had even more of us come—you would not smile.”\nHe was not smiling now.\n“Your King never fought our tribes, and we would not have given up our lands to him like Chandrar. I am not looking for a battle, now, or to seek glory, Gazi Pathseeker. But I hear from my Chieftain’s sister that you take an interest in the same girl we seek. A dangerous one. I would not like to come to blows with you.”\nGazi slowly rotated her neck, shrugging her shoulders to unlimber them.\n“And I would not like your warriors to go to Liscor. You seem intent on being my problem. So let us make a peaceful offer. Turn around and go back to your tribe. Now.”\nHer central eye’s pupil dilated slowly as the Gnolls stirred. Several growled, but Rometh just sniffed without apparent fear.\n“You howl loudly, Gazi Pathseeker.”\n“Do you think eighteen of your lot can refuse?”\nHer ‘smile’ had countless needle points of danger. In reply, Rometh shook his head. His voice was level and his gaze direct as he spread his paws.\n“I am no fool to fight legends, Gazi Pathseeker. If you should push your will at Liscor, who could refuse you? No one with sense, and I have sense.”\nShe smiled—for about one second. Then Rometh went on calmly, glancing at the other Gnolls.\n“If you insist and we insist, we must give way. So I shall give way and admit I am the lesser of us by far. But do you know what is coming next year? The Meeting of Tribes.”\nThe Gnolls chuckled at that, and Buleth thought of that grand gathering far in the future. Then—he saw Rometh’s gaze meet Gazi’s.\n“If you insist, Gazi Pathseeker, I shall tell Honored Krshia I am too weak to stop you. And my Chieftain, embarrassing as it is. Then I shall go and tell Shaman Theikha of Gaarh Marsh, Chieftain Xherw of Plain’s Eye, and the tribe of Az’muzarre how weak I am. Loudly. You stand a legend on foreign ground, Adventurer Pathseeker. We have our own.”\nHe smiled as Gazi’s own grin vanished and she sat there, eyes fixed on his face. Rometh turned to see where Yvlon and Ryoka had gone.\n“You are alone and my people fill this continent. Walk quietly, Lady Pathseeker. Lest you wake something up.”\nIt was good advice, to her—and the young woman who was so insane. Perhaps Honored Krshia would be interested in this Ryoka Griffin too? Assuming, of course, that the [Merchant] could talk some sense into her.",

    "text": "“Who…are you? Just a [Merchant]?”\nRyoka’s first question caught Ysara off-guard. But then she didn’t look like a regular citizen of the North. A woman with a sword travelling the South? Ysara waved this off.\n“That’s my class, yes. I have a bit of a reputation as a [Merchant]. The Silver Merchant, they call me, but I doubt you’ll hear my name that widely remembered in the North. I mostly work in the South.”\n“Then—why are you so interested in me? Can’t you leave me alone?”\nYsara sucked in a breath. She didn’t make it easy, this Runner. But she just gave Ryoka another crooked smile.\n“Can’t a traveller try to help another on the road? It’s the oldest give and take in the world. Now you’ve calmed down a bit—will you accept I just want to help, Miss Ryoka?”\nThe Runner said not a word. Her face was still red, and she was breathing hard. But it seemed to Ysara that was embarrassment now. As if…this were a familiar conversation to her. Ryoka just glowered though.\n“I don’t want handouts. I don’t want to owe a\nfavor.\n”\n“Then you owe me nothing. Just hear me out. Friendly advice. I don’t want anything from you. Frankly, I don’t need a City Runner’s help. If I need to, I’d hire a Courier.”\nThat needled Ryoka. But Ysara put a hand out.\n“I just don’t want to see someone die in front of me. And you…I won’t ask where you’re going. I know Runners take such things seriously. The good ones, at any rate. Yet surely someone told you the Bloodfields would be dangerous and to go around. It’s not bravado, surely, that makes you want to ignore all reasonable advice?”\nRyoka bit her lip. She had the intense urge to flip Ysara off and just run—but Gazi made her nervous. And the fact that Ysara was speaking so—pragmatically made it hard. It wasn’t like Magnolia. Ysara didn’t know Ryoka. So why did Ryoka want to tell her to get bent?\n“I’ll live. I’ve survived worse.”\n“Yes, but…let’s assume you do. You cut your feet up on the grass.”\nYsara gave Ryoka’s toes a pointed look. Ryoka had dabbed healing potion on them, and they were good as new. But even so. Ryoka bit her tongue as Ysara indicated the\nlong\nBloodfields.\n“This area is miles upon miles long. You would shred your feet. Even if you can use potions, why suffer? Why risk the dangers in there? One awake Watchertree or a Colony Sac or…let’s assume you survive. Why try?”\n“Why does someone climb a mountain? I like challenges.”\nRyoka shot back instantly. She pointed at the High Passes, so vast they stretched beyond the clouds looming over everything. Ysara peered at the mountains.\n“I don’t know why someone would climb the High Passes. No one has ever survived who got anywhere close to the top. I do know adventurers, though, and I know risk. Believe me, as a [Merchant] I’ve been in danger travelling Izril. I am also a young enough woman to know why you’d want to dare it for excitement and bravado.”\nRyoka hesitated. She eyed Ysara, and the woman didn’t have lines, but…\n“…How old are you?”\n“Thirty-four.”\n“You’re old.”\nYsara resisted the urge to slap Ryoka. She tried her best ‘I hate your guts, but I am going to sell you at a high markup’ smile.\n“If nothing else, Miss Ryoka—what would your friends think, your family, if you were to go missing? I do not want to be the bearer of bad news to those who care about you.”\nAt that Ryoka Griffin—flinched. So visibly and so hard that even if Ysara had no eyes at all, she would have seen…\nOh. Oh, was it fate or chance that the two met?\nBecause Ysara instantly saw something in Ryoka she didn’t want to necessarily see.\n“No one’s waiting for me. Not my f—no family, and no friends. Okay? So leave me alone. I’ll go run in, level up—isn’t that how you’re supposed to do it?”\nRyoka turned, and Ysara spoke to her back.\n“You know, my family loves honesty and integrity. Just like metal. It’s our motif. Silver and steel. Purity and strength. Valor and something else. For all that, most of my family can’t spot a liar even when it’s tattooed on their face. But you—even my brother would know you’re lying, Miss Ryoka. Everyone has someone who cares for them. Everyone has a friend.”\nHopefully.\nOr maybe you found them far from home. The young woman’s shoulders hunched. Then her head came around, and she spat venom fairly well, despite not being an Oldblood Drake or a serpent.\n“You wouldn’t know anything about my problems! I’m tired of people coming into my life and offering\nadvice\nor trying—trying to ‘\nhelp’.\nI’m not like the rest of you, do you understand? I just want to be left\nalone.\nYou won’t enjoy my company, and I won’t repay generosity.\nGot it?\n”\nThe conversation in the rest of the merchant’s camp stopped, and Ysara suspected everyone had heard that, not just the Gnolls and Gazi. Ryoka looked mortified—but Ysara began to get the issue.\nShe, too, knew someone running away from home when she saw it. Mirrors did exist—but the Silver Merchant just exhaled. She was rarely this personal so quickly—but she knew her clients. And though Ryoka wasn’t in any regular sense of the word—Ysara looked north, over her shoulder, and spoke truth like silver. Painful words glittering in the air.\n“In my experience, Miss Griffin, no matter how much we want to run forever—someday we do have to go back. And it is better not to leave regrets behind. They grow. Better to face them now. It is harder than monsters. But a more important battle. If only we could always know we’d win.”\nShe stared towards the horizon, past the High Passes as she said that. with a faraway grimace on her face. Ryoka stared at Ysara and shook her head.\n“I’m a piece of shit. You—you really wouldn’t get it. I can’t fit in and be friendly.\nI don’t enjoy it.\nI can’t be a good person back to Ga—to the H—to people. So it’s better if they don’t try. I don’t\nbelong.\nSo…can’t you just leave me be? Just let me run and not bother me?”\nIt was a strange question. In Ysara’s experience, in her travels of the south, a lot of Drakes and Gnolls were only too happy to do business with her and never ask her name or ask how a Human came to be there and treat her like a prop. But someone…she wondered what her sister might say of Ryoka after all, as it was clear they had met.\nSomeone, or many people, had met Ryoka. And to the young woman’s complaints, Ysara didn’t have an answer to what sounded like a mess. She didn’t really like messes—or people of Ryoka’s personality—or the hold up and chaos this one young woman was causing to her journey, if admittedly only for half an hour or so.\nBut what Ysara did have to take objection with was the last bit. She turned to face Ryoka.\n“Miss Griffin. Look at me for one second.”\nRyoka eyed Ysara, and the Silver Merchant brushed at her long, indigo hair. She showed Ryoka her bare shoulder where the glittering silver ship rose out of the golden vines and the earring on one ear.\n“Miss Griffin. Would you believe I belong to a noble family in the north? A small one, but I’m technically a [Lady] by birth. And if you know anything of the north, I think you understand what my House is like. Miss Ryoka.\nI know something about not fitting in.\n”\nMore than Ryoka could know. But the City Runner looked at Ysara,\nlooked\nat her and slowly nodded.\n“So? Are you going to say that I should go back and try? That I—I should keep making the attempt? That I owe it to my friends not to let them down?”\nYsara paused a beat.\n“I rather think that is your case, Miss Griffin.\nI\nwas going to say that if they cannot accept you with all your oddities—if not your objectionable behavior—if they cannot accept the core of you, they do not deserve your company. But then—I also respect someone who would change the mountain to fit their passage.”\nShe smiled wide and wondered if Ryoka understood any of it. The City Runner looked at Ysara for a long time, and the Silver Merchant encouraged her.\n“But if there are good sorts behind you—why not come back with us? My sister can be—well, I haven’t seen her for at least five years. But we could always use a companion on the road. It could be pleasant.”\nPerhaps Ryoka didn’t know why she was being offered so much by the [Merchants], the Gnolls, and arguably, Gazi.\nPerhaps she didn’t know how she looked. Runners always looked windblown, sometimes dusty, sometimes dirty, sometimes bloody or harried.\nFew looked\nsad\nlike this. Or as lost. Or as…desperate.\nRyoka Griffin stood there and wavered. And Ysara thought she\nsaw\npart of Ryoka step forwards, take her hand, and turn back north. For a second, it looked like she was turning—then something, something in her, dragged her back. The City Runner stepped back and shook her head.\n“I have to go. I…”\nShe trailed off, and her eyes flickered.\n“I have to go.”\nShe stopped, and Ysara exhaled sadly. But then Ryoka added.\n“Thanks. I’ll think about what you said. And I’ll stay away from the Bloodfields.”\nYsara nodded.\n“That’s all I can ask for. At least have a cup of tea or one of Buleth’s snacks, though. And—”\nShe was going to say, ‘and if you want me to take a message, I can’, but Ysara never got the chance. Because behind her, she heard a sudden howl.\n“\nTreacher—\n”\nThe Gnolls? Ryoka and Ysara turned—and then an arrow shot\nthrough\nthe canvas walls of one of the caravan wagons. Ysara\ndodged\nit, saw the red Roc’s feather—and then she heard the shouting.\n“\nStop fighting! Stop f—\nLady Pathseeker, pl—”\nGazi Pathseeker stood in the middle of a firefight. What had begun it in the time they had taken to talk, Ysara didn’t know.\nWhat she\ndid\nsee were the Silverfangs, all eighteen, racing for the horses. There were only ten that mounted, but the remaining eight charged after the riders—and all eighteen were showering arrows behind them.\nNot at the terrified [Merchants]—but at\nGazi.\nAnd she?\nShe was deflecting arrows with her claymore or letting them snap on her armor. Ysara, sword drawn, saw Gazi whirl her gigantic blade around with two hands and chop an arrow in half.\nChop in half an arrow shot at fifty paces by a longbow. Ysara had seen fast blades from Silver-bell duelists. This?\nThis was a legend.\nAnd she advanced, calmly, into the arrows as the Gnolls retreated.\nWhy were they fighting?\n“Buleth! Why are they fighting?”\nYsara grabbed the Drake; he had taken cover behind the wagon, and Ysara crouched down as Ryoka hunkered down; even she wasn’t unafraid of the arrows.\n“I don’t know! They were both threatening the other, but then they fell silent, and I thought—\nthen she got up\nand cut one of their heads off!\nKeep your heads down! Protect the goods!\n”\nBuleth’s screams didn’t inspire anyone to shield the goods with their bodies, but everyone obeyed the first order.\nRyoka? Ryoka was frozen because she had seen the first body. A Gnoll lay on the ground—her head severed from the torso. Dead. Rometh was howling rage at Gazi as she deflected arrows, grinning as her bloody sword whirled through the air.\nAnd Gazi was beginning to charge, still deflecting arrows away from her face—the Gnolls were fleeing fast, north, towards Liscor.\n“W-what the\nfuck\nis going on?”\nRyoka called out. She dared to raise her head with Ysara while Buleth still hid—mostly because the Gnolls had good aim and they were just loosing at Gazi. The Named-rank adventurer was laughing as she ran, and Ysara saw the younger [Traders], [Merchants], Runners, shamefaced [Guards], all slowly emerging from cover. The fight was moving uphill at speed, and now there wasn’t even a remote chance of catching an arrow; the two groups had to be half a mile away already.\nShe glanced at the Bloodfields—and they were mercifully quiet. The nearby hills were silent, and the fighting was moving north towards the high ridgeline. The Gnolls had speed over Gazi, and they might make it.\nBut what was the battle about? Ryoka looked at Ysara, and the Silver Merchant turned to Buleth.\n“Time to get going. We might need to skip Liscor.”\nThe pale [Merchant] could only nod.",

    "text": "“Are you sure you won’t come with us?”\nIt’s the oddest thing. I’ve barely known her for a hot minute—and yet I want to take Ysara up on her offer.\nMaybe it’s because she’s not like Magnolia. Maybe it’s because I’m so guilty. Maybe it’s because she’s\nreally\nnot like Magnolia or anyone else I’ve met in the north, and she’s the gayest woman I’ve seen in this world so far*.\n*Is that bad to think? The hair color, the tattoo, one earring? Maybe it’s different over here. I swear she was staring at me like Calruz does, though…\nI like her. I like Calruz. I liked them. I was afraid of it.\nShe struck home. She struck a nerve. I…I think there’s something in me.\nA little war. Part of me wants to go and keep running. To jump into the Bloodfields and never look back. The rest?\nGo back and say sorry to Ceria. To the Horns. To the people you respect and bowed to and swore you would repay.\nI want to. Oh, I do. But something is dragging me over.\nThe geas. Myself.\nI—I—\nThere’s something wrong with me.\nMore than magic.\nI want to take her up, but I look Ysara in the eyes.\n“I’ve got something to do. I’m sorry.”\nShe smiles and extends a hand ruefully. She’s got calluses as I take it. She’s actually a swordswoman.\n“As am I. But if you catch us—at least let’s have a drink, agreed?”\n“I’d like that.”\nI think I whisper those words. I actually would. But then I’m shaking Buleth’s claws, trying not to stare at the Drake as he stares at my…hips? And the Gnolls and I\nwant to go.\nFind the Necromancer. Find the Necromancer. FindtheNecromancer. Findthenecromancerfindthenecromancerfindthenecromancer—\nI want to go back.\nI want—\nI wish I could stay because I feel like something’s connecting in my head. But I can’t. So I go—and I keep looking back. Back, at Ysara, who’s watching me as the caravan begins to go around the final part of the Bloodfields. I’m jogging by that red terrain, staring at those alien forests.\nHow can I even describe what I’m seeing? Some of it is just—unnatural. Just like giant fungi—unsettling spores with huge veins that look alien, poisonous. But another plant looks like a giant…pillow? It must be four feet tall and just as wide across, and there are larger varieties deeper within!\nPale white…stalks. Long fronds of plants—all covered by a bit of frost. All dead. Or hibernating? Teriarch told me I could do this moderately safely. But I remember Ysara’s words and don’t go towards the Bloodfields. I’m just jogging with rocky slopes leading up to the cliffs beyond. Boring sandstone up there or some local rock.\nPast the Bloodfields. Along the mountain range…a forest. How\nfar\nis that, I wonder? How many weeks or months to find this guy?\nFindhimfindhimhavetofindhim—\nCeria and Gerial and Calruz are going into a dungeon. Ysara’s…nice. I want to go back. Why can’t I…? I want to run into the Bloodfields. I’m crazy. I’ve always been crazy, haven’t I?\n“The Lich. The High Passes. I didn’t care if I died.”\nThe words sound—wrong. Because they’re true. I want to go back, but two things carry me on. Myself. My damned self.\nAnd the magic.\nI think I’m fighting. I want to go back. I twist around, and if Ysara’s looking at me, I’ll—\nI turn and spin and spin—and a lance of agony strikes my shoulder, and when I stop, I stare blankly at something wrong. Wronger than my head. A black…steel bolt, not like the Gnoll’s arrows. Compact and short and iron. It’s in my shoulder, and my skin’s deformed around it. And I hear someone screaming my name, and I stare at it.\nA crossbow bolt?",

    "text": "Ysara saw the ambush as Ryoka Griffin slowed and turned. If the Runner had been looking straight, it would have gone straight through her side. As it was—it went through one of her shoulder blades. At first, she had no idea what was going on.\nThen—she saw three figures wearing black cloth over their heads and faces and remembered something.\nThe three Humans.\nHadn’t she seen…more Humans taking cover when the Gnolls were fighting Gazi? Hiding behind some rocks. She hadn’t—\nThey were on the ridge.\nOne had a crossbow, and he’d fired it straight down at Ryoka. It would have gone straight through Ryoka’s chest—instead, it hit her shoulder, spun her around, and nearly dropped her onto her back with the force of it.\n“\nShit—\n”\n“Shoot again! Shoot again!”\nTwo voices echoed as, again, the [Merchants] took cover, crying out in alarm. A high-pitched, female voice, belonging to a thin young woman with pigtails screaming at a panicking young man holding a crossbow.\nRyoka Griffin stumbled, stared at the blood welling from the bolt in her shoulder, and opened her mouth to scream in pain. Then her eyes bulged. She looked up—and Ryoka spoke a name.\n“\nPersua.\n”\nPersua, Claudeil, and Toriska emerged from behind cover. Faces covered—and the girl screamed.\n“\nKill her! Toriska,\nkill her!”\n“Don’t hit me, Claudeil!”\nThe second Runner came sprinting down the hill, holding her daggers. Ryoka was still staring at her shoulder in shock.\n“\n[Bandits]! Run for it!\n”\nBuleth was screaming, but Ysara seized the same horse she’d kept handy—just in case she saw Ryoka going for the Bloodfields.\n“\nNo! Get to Ryoka! Someone’s trying to kill her!\n”\nShe leapt into the saddle, sword drawn—but the Runners were at least a thousand paces away, and Ryoka was stupefied. The one with the crossbow was trying to reload it, and the other was screaming at her companion.\n“\nKill her! Kill her before she shouts our names to—\n”\nThen Persua looked up and saw Ysara riding down on them. The [Merchant] had a sword drawn like some [Cavalry Rider], and Toriska froze as she saw a real swordswoman coming at her.\nBut Ryoka was right there, and she was barehanded. Toriska charged with a scream.\n“\nYou—\n”\nRyoka finally broke out of her stupor. She saw Toriska coming—pivoted—and\nkicked.\nBarefoot or not—Toriska was wearing light leather armor suited for running. The ball of Ryoka’s foot still\nslammed\ninto her chest, and she went stumbling backwards, her warcry in her lungs. She staggered—then slashed.\nRyoka Griffin felt a line of pain cut down her leg and gasped. She hadn’t ever fought someone with a knife. She knew how to kick them, but the cut—\nThe cut laid open her calf, slashed through a muscle, and Ryoka screamed in pain as she staggered. Toriska’s daggers were\nsharp!\n“\nDrop your weapons or die!\n”\nYsara was shouting. Toriska caught herself—and she might be bruised, but she saw Ryoka staring at the huge gash in her leg. And she had a crossbow bolt in her useless arm.\n“\nShoot the horse! The horse!\n”\nClaudeil’s crossbow\ntwanged\nagain, and Ysara shouted and a horse screamed as it went down, a crossbow bolt jutting out above its left foreleg. The woman went down, tumbling from the saddle as [Guards] rode after her, shouting and trying to aim bows. The Runners were terrified.\n“\nPersua, we have to\ngo—”\nClaudeil shouted, wanting to run into the foothills and hide, but Persua slashed at him. She had a knife too, and he flinched.\n“\nDon’t say my name! If she lives, she’ll tell them. They’ll hang us—we’ll be wanted, you fool!\nShoot her!\nToriska, get her and we can go!\n”\nThe Runners looked at Persua and then at Ryoka. Ryoka saw Toriska advance, slashing with her daggers. And she…\nShe had levels. Ryoka did not.\n“[Slashy Storm]!”\nToriska’s blades\nblurred\n, forming a wall of uncoordinated but\nfast\nslashes. Ryoka backed up, but her leg was cut and—Toriska was still a Runner.\nShe got Ryoka, and the City Runner stared at her arm and a cut that went down to her bone. She screamed—and then she was turning, running, her good hand fumbling for a healing potion. She ran the only way she could:\ntowards\nthe Bloodfields. Toriska hesitated—then sprinted after her, and the two women were running.\nAnd Persua?",

    "text": "“\nPersua, this is crazy!\n”\nClaudeil had thought his best friend, Persua, was crazy when she told him that Ryoka had to die. But she had convinced him—Ryoka had cost them their City Runner careers. All they had to do was follow her, nail her with his crossbow, and no one would know. They’d even get the gold Magnolia had given her.\nUntil he’d been there, with her in his sights, he hadn’t realized how…how it would be him pulling the trigger. A [Guardsman] might ask him on a truth stone if he’d killed someone, and he’d have to say ‘yes’ or be found out.\nHe’d hesitated. Persua had grabbed the crossbow. She hadn’t hesitated. But then it had gone\nwrong.\nThe [Merchant] with the blade had taken cover behind her screaming horse. She’d tried to advance, but he had fired two crossbow bolts, and she didn’t look like she wanted to dodge them. But—\nAn arrow rattled off the boulders high, high overhead, and Persua screamed and he flinched.\nThe [Guards] were shooting arrows. Very inaccurately, but Claudeil was terrified.\n“\nThey have [Guards]! I told you we should have waited!\n”\nHe screamed at Persua, but they had barely caught up with Ryoka drinking stamina potions after four days. Persua was white and red at the same time, somehow. She screamed back.\n“\nWe’ll lose them! Just shoot Ryoka already!\n”\nClaudeil poked his head up as he put another bolt into his crossbow and feverishly drew back the drawstring. He stared down at Ryoka, flinching as another arrow landed well clear of them. One [Pinpoint Shot] and he was dead…\nHe saw, to his disbelief, two figures running\ninto\nthe Bloodfields. Ryoka and…\n“Toriska’s doing her [Fast Sprint]!\nShe’s barely able to keep up!\n”\nRyoka was fast! She was running for her life after all, and everyone knew she was the fastest Runner—but even without seeming to use a Skill, she was ahead of Toriska. But the other Runner had knifed her at least once—Ryoka was bleeding from the lower back.\nYet the blood was healing, and even as he watched, Claudeil swore he saw the crossbow bolt he’d hit her with falling out.\nHealing potions!\n“We have to kill her. She’s going into the Bloodfields. Toriska can’t catch Ryoka. See? She’s already falling behind now that her Skill’s done. But three of us can get her.”\nPersua swung herself up onto the boulder. To Claudeil’s astonishment, Persua, Persua who\nhated\ngoing through monster-infested areas, who never started fights but always seemed to get him and Toriska involved—pointed into a\ndeath-zone.\n“Are you mad?”\nHe looked at her, aghast, but she just stared at him. Her eyes were wide, and she was breathing hard through her nose, her nostrils dilating. Her face was white, but her eyes—she looked at Ryoka.\n“She’s going to get away unless we go. And if she says we tried to kill her, Magnolia Reinhart will murder us in our beds. Come on.”\nShe dragged Claudiel up. More arrows landed around them, but the [Guards] must not have had [Archer] classes. He whimpered.\n“That [Merchant]’ll kill us!”\n“Not in the Bloodfields. See? No one’s going after Toriska. They’re afraid. But the Bloodfields aren’t moving. Come\non.\n”\nPersua grabbed Claudeil with more force than he thought she had in her thin frame. He debated refusing another time, but Persua lifted the dagger and looked him in the eyes. He saw the perfect calm in hers.\n“If you run, I’ll make sure you die if it’s the last thing I do. Ryoka’s taken everything from me. This is all her fault. Fals, my City Runner rank…we’re going in there.”\nClaudeil hesitated one more second—but then he leapt out from the boulders, skated down the rocks, and ran. Ysara came after them, but the Runners\nwere\nCity Runners—they charged into the Bloodfields, and the [Merchant] hesitated and backed away from one of the dormant Watchertrees. She stared at Ryoka, then whirled and shouted for a horse, for bows—\nAnd Claudeil was running after Ryoka, aiming at her with a crossbow as she disappeared through a silent thicket of the strange trees. This time, he didn’t hesitate. First Ryoka died. Then…he never wanted to see Persua again. He’d go somewhere else. He had gone after Ryoka because more than the law, more than murder or the Bloodfields—\nPersua scared him the most.",

    "text": "This was it. Ryoka knew it as she ran through the Bloodfields.\nShe was bleeding. Her wounds healed as she drank a potion, and the taste was foul—like acrid bitterness—the same taste you got if you ever accidentally found a bug in your mouth. Yet it was life, and every other sensation was far worse.\nGlass under feet.\nA thousand tiny blades slicing her feet’s soles to shreds. The Bloodfields’ grass was—sharp.\nShe would have left a trail of bloody footprints behind her if it weren’t for the red already around her.\nRed—\nand the silent plants and gigantic pods that seemed to\nrustle\nas she passed. But the Bloodfields were silent.\nYet she felt she was in as much danger as in the High Passes—if not more. Like a trap waiting to be sprung. Even without Ysara’s warnings—\nRyoka felt like she was running into the depths of hell itself. Into a foreign land filled with nightmares and the wrong kind of aliens.\nEven the creatures looked—\nwrong.\nShe saw one of them staring at her. Then bounding away as a crossbow bolt missed her and thudded into the ground.\nWas that a rabbit? It had…a face like a leech. ‘Teeth’, a flat face—combined with the regular rabbit’s fur.\nEverything here wanted her blood. And she was bleeding.\n“\nRyoka! Come back and die!\n”\nA scream, high and wild. Persua was coming. Ryoka would have gone back to fight her—but it wasn’t just\nher.\nClaudeil’s crossbow twanged again, and it missed her again. He wasn’t the best shot, but he’d hit her twice. Once, in the shoulder. The second time—in the lower back, just above her hips.\nShe couldn’t stop to pull the bolt out.\nEvery time she moved, she felt it\ntwisting\nand cutting her open from the inside.\nBut if she stopped, Toriska or Persua would get her. The Runner with her daggers had gained confidence after seeing Ryoka bleed.\nShe was trying to cut Ryoka down. Cripple her by cutting her hamstrings. Knife her enough times in the back or get to her throat where no healing potions would save Ryoka.\nMonsters. They scared Ryoka more than the Eater Goats. More than the Goblins. They were people. They were supposed to be Runners—\nThey’d crushed her leg once. This time—they’d kill her.\nPersua hung back as the two Runners spread out. Ryoka was slower than she needed to be. The pain from her laceterated feet and her injuries, even with the potion, made her slow—and they had Skills.\n“[Fleetwind Run]!”\nClaudeil ran in a sudden burst of speed, circling Ryoka as she ran towards another ‘forest’. She dodged behind one of the pillow-pods, eight feet tall and massive, and Toriska circled around the other way. Ryoka saw the young man raise his crossbow and covered her face with her arms.\nThunk.\nThe crossbow missed her by a foot. Claudeil cursed; his Skill had given him a tremendous backwind to help him run faster. It had also thrown off the aim of the bolt.\nIt thudded into the red, meaty pillow-thing next to Ryoka, and the entire plant\nshivered.\nRyoka twisted around—and Toriska was coming the other way. Ryoka fumbled at her belt.\n“\nGot h—\n”\nThe belt knife Ryoka carried nearly stabbed Toriska in the face. She recoiled with a shriek.\n“\n[Evasive Roll]!\n”\nShe rolled away with amazing speed, dodging the first stab, and Ryoka charged her. Toriska screamed for help as Ryoka slashed as inexpertly as Toriska. But she saw an opening. Toriska was trying to block Ryoka with her daggers, forgetting that was nearly impossible.\nThere. Knife her straight through one of her orange eyes.\nPut the tip of the blade through the pupil and\npush—\nThe urge was in Ryoka. Every time she saw Toriska, Claudeil, Persua, people she didn’t like—\nShe had always wanted to do something to them like this. Something unforgivable. All the things the dark voice whispered and shouted at her to do.\nDidn’t she deserve…?\nRyoka hesitated, and Toriska rolled away again. She scrambled back, and Ryoka missed her chance. She couldn’t do it.\nStab her through the face? She didn’t…\nShe didn’t want that after all.\nThe irony of realizing this, now? Ryoka nearly screamed, but she didn’t…she looked over her shoulder and\nducked\nas something cut the air and hit the pillow-plant again, making it ripple and shredding the plantain fabric.\nShe didn’t want to become that.\nPersua had a wand. She aimed it, and another dart of…stone blasted through the air. It had less punch than Claudeil’s crossbow, but it grazed Ryoka like a punch across one cheek and tore the skin. Ryoka dodged as Persua screamed.\n“\nToriska, flank her! Claudeil—\n”\nHe was dropping bolts. Persua made up for her lackeys’ failings by unloading spell after spell with the wand. She only stopped when she saw Ryoka had taken cover—and that her wand was dead. She tossed it aside and reached for another.\nMadness. If there were anyone that Ryoka would kill in this or any other world, it would be Persua. The other Runner had a terrible look in her eyes.\nNot madness, whatever that looked like. That was probably on Ryoka’s face, a snarl of desperation, too-wide eyes, and a hysterical urge to laugh. Persua…\nPersua just looked angry. Frustrated. And a quiet little demon in her looked delighted. This is it.\nWe’re settling this.\nNo one to interfere. Claudeil turned and ran, shouting in fear, as a few arrows landed around him, but the distant archers, including Ysara, weren’t in the Bloodfields. They were screaming at Ryoka to\nrun\n. To get to them—but Persua, Claudeil, and Toriska were blocking her flight to safety. The only other way was deeper into the Bloodfields.\nRyoka Griffin lifted the dagger in her hand as she stared at Persua—then she cried out, swiped left—Toriska jumped away. Then a brand of frozen pain hit her in the temple, and Ryoka’s head snapped back.\nIce shard.\nPersua’s second wand fired miniature versions of Ceria’s spell, [Ice Spike]. And her aim was better than—\nA crossbow bolt hit the pillow plant.\nRyoka stumbled upright, resting her weight against the shivering plant. And then—as she wondered what to do—she looked at the red, heaving mass.\nAnd she realized what the Bloodfields were.\nRyoka stared into the gaps left by the two crossbow bolts and Persua’s attacks. They had cut the thick lining of the plant opening, exposing the innards. The walls weren’t actually that thick. Ryoka would have guessed the ‘skin’ of the plant was a foot deep, but the reality was half that at most. Because the plant was actually a—\nNursery?\nRyoka Griffin stared into a dark chamber that—\nrustled—\nalong with the shivering of the pillow-plant. It was\nhollow\n, mostly, with internal chambers filled with…\nInsects. They lined the walls. The eggs filled the interior of the nursery. They were hibernating, hiding from the cold in this plant. The fighting, Ryoka’s proximity, and the cold was waking them up. She could see them rustling around in agitation—but the cold was keeping them—\nSilent.\nAsleep. Ryoka’s head twisted. And she saw one of the spore-plants slowly rising. As if it were raising its head. Waking up.\nOne of the shivering pale trees was twitching. The Bloodfields—\n“—Ryoka!”\nYsara’s voice in the distance. Ryoka looked up and saw the [Merchant] striding into the Bloodfields, warily, sword drawn as the [Guards] aimed bows, forcing Claudeil and Persua to retreat. She was beckoning.\nRyoka began to run her way. Then—so suddenly it shocked even Toriska, circling her—and something\nforced\nher to turn around, start running deeper into the Bloodfields.\nFIND. THE. NECROMANCER.\n“Stop it!”\nShe was screaming. Ryoka ran deeper, crying now, and her foes followed. Then she began laughing. She was cursed. This time there was magic—but she had been doing this from the start. The High Passes hadn’t killed her. Running deliveries against monsters hadn’t.\nThis…\nShe wanted this.\nRyoka dropped her dagger rather than put it in her belt-sheath. She didn’t want to kill—she didn’t have the guts to do it. Persua, though? Toriska? Claudeil?\n“Let’s all die. Good riddance.\nYou want me, Persua? Come and get me!\n”\nRyoka screamed, and Persua’s head snapped up. She fired three more shards of ice—then motioned. Claudeil and Toriska hesitated, but they were in too far.\nDeeper.\nRyoka ran towards the largest grove she could find and drew something else from her belt pouch. A thought crossed her mind. Truth without prevarication.\nI feel so alive. Did I want this? This? To matter? To risk my life and not let anyone down?\nI feel so lonely. I wish someone were here. Garia. Anyone.\nShe looked back, and it hit her as she saw Ysara, now running, far slower than the Runners. Persua’s twisted smile as she saw Ryoka’s weary, desperate faltering run.\nI wanted a friend. But I was afraid.\nI don’t know how to be a friend. I wish—\nThen the fourth crossbow bolt hit her in the leg, and she went crashing into the sharp blades of grass. When Ryoka sat up, she saw Claudeil reloading his crossbow. Persua aimed the wand at Ryoka’s face. But she said nothing. She just fired the wand—twice.\nThe first went wide. The second hit Ryoka and might have cracked her skull. Ryoka’s head snapped back—and she fell back on the ground. Only to sit up again—but the skin across her forehead was torn. Blood ran down her face as Toriska stopped.\nRyoka had managed to tear the second crossbow bolt free of her back, but blood was slowly oozing down her back legs. It trickled down her face and made a mask that added to the desperate, despairing look as she stared back at her pursuers. Even Toriska hesitated and looked sideways.\n“Persua…”\n“Got you.”\nPersua never looked at Toriska. If her friend had been lying with her throat cut—Persua would have had eyes only for Ryoka. She was smiling, just like she did in the Runner’s Guild.\nThe wand wouldn’t kill Ryoka. The runner was getting up even as Persua snapped more frozen shards into her skin, leaving icy shards embedded in flesh. She hit Ryoka in the stomach, arm, her bad leg—and then handed the wand to Toriska.\n“Give me that crossbow, Claudeil. She can’t run any more.”\n“She’s got a wand, Persua—”\nClaudeil flinched as he saw Ryoka had a strange wand in her hand. Persua had a cheap one, made of spruce or something, with cheap gem and magicore fillings.\nRyoka’s…Persua looked up in sudden paranoia, and she snatched the crossbow as the three of them looked around—then found one of the pillow-plants. Toriska dove behind it—Claudeil found one of the pale mushrooms, foul-brown in color and with a huge cap to shield most of him. Persua poked her head out from behind the pillow, and Ryoka was standing, now.\nThe leg with the crossbow bolt stuck in it bore none of her weight. She was trying to pull it out, but her hand was slippery with blood. And the other was holding that wand.\nIt was…red. Red crystal? It looked hot.\nSteam was rising in the chilly air as Persua eyed it. Even her wand was more expensive than anything the other Runners carried.\n“Dibs on that wand.\nSomething wrong with your leg, Ryoka?\n”\nPersua called out, and Ryoka’s head snapped up. Neither girl fired though—Persua was trying to get Ryoka’s head as it bent and then twisted to track her. And she was afraid of Ryoka’s counterattack.\n“If it’s a wand of [Fireball]…”\nClaudeil was panting with terror as he came to the most logical conclusion. Persua looked around.\n“Toriska, run left. Distract her.”\n“Me?\nNo!\n”\nToriska instantly refused. Persua swung the crossbow around, and for a second, she and Toriska locked gazes as the other Runner went white—but then Ryoka shouted back.\n“\nYou want me, Persua? Let’s end this once and for all!\n”\nHer voice was ragged and wild. But she was laughing. Laughing and coughing with each word, as if her lungs had blood in them. Ryoka lifted the wand, and all the Runners ducked. Ryoka stared at them and then around this terrible, red land.\n“\nThen let’s die here. Come on, Persua!\n”\nThe wand’s tip ignited into fire so bright and hot it was white. Persua ducked back with a scream, and the crossbow bolt fired wide as Ryoka aimed the wand. A searing jet of flames blasted overhead.\n“She missed!\nRun! She’s got a Gold-rank wand!\n”\nClaudeil shouted, but then he realized Ryoka was shooting again. Flames shot from the tip of her wand. Not a cheap, Tier 1 or Tier 2 spell like Persua’s—but a\njet\nof flames white-hot, so fiery that even dozens of feet overhead it baked him.\nAnd she could keep firing the spell. The flamethrower froze the Runners, and Claudeil waited to see Persua go up in flames as the girl cowered and shrieked.\nBut—Ryoka didn’t roast them. She could have—but she swung the wand around. Left, right, overhead—behind her? But then Claudeil wasn’t paying attention.\n“[Scatter Dash]! [Emergency Smokescreen]!”\n“\n[Deflect Attention: Claudeil]!\n”\nThe other Runners were screaming, using Skills to evade the flames. But Ryoka had the worst aim in the world—she was aiming far too high. As the three City Runners fled their cover, they saw more jets of flame landing. The fire…didn’t burn out immediately. It rained down from overhead, and Ryoka was shooting it everywhere. Trying to cut off their escape?\nFive minutes. Five minutes of Ryoka blasting flame across the Bloodfields. She whirled a firestorm into the air—and it missed the Runners completely. Not that they were anywhere close to her. But she lobbed huge arcs of white flame into the sky and watched them spread out and bake the land.\nEven her wand had a limit, though.\nThe crystal went dead, and Ryoka let it drop. Then she grabbed the bolt in her leg and began to draw it out.\nShe\nflinched\nas Persua nearly nailed her other leg with a crossbow bolt. The Runner was laughing.\n“You idiot! You missed!”\nShe had been dodging just a second ago. But now…Ryoka Griffin looked up. She had a healing potion in her hands, but no more weapons. She looked up at Persua as the girl slowly reloaded her crossbow. Claudeil and Toriska stood behind Persua, panting. They wanted nothing more but for this to be over. The air smelled of smoke, now, and was hot from the flames.\nHot.\nRyoka was smiling. She looked relieved. Like someone who had been dangling on the edge of a cliff and at last…let go.\n“Goodbye, Persua. I don’t think either of us are getting out of this.”\nPersua just sneered as she brushed at the cloth covering her features.\n“Those [Merchants] can’t do anything. Even if they claim we were here—they have no proof. Not even Lady Reinhart can get us. I have powerful friends.”\n“Really? Then good luck.”\nRyoka’s smile was bloody. Persua’s brows crossed—then she heard a moan. It came from Claudeil, and he touched her shoulder.\n“Persua.”\nShe swung around, looking for the [Merchants]. Her first thought was that the one with the silver blade had caught up. But no—the woman with indigo hair was standing at the edges of the Bloodfields. If anything, she’d begun retreating towards the rest of her group. And the [Merchants] were…fleeing back?\nThen Persua felt the heat on the breeze. She looked around, and the flames that Ryoka had shot everywhere were still burning. But mostly—it was just warm. Hot.\nRyoka’s aim had not been at the other Runners. It had instead been at—the interspersed growth on the Bloodfields. The plants and silent, slumbering Bloodfields. Sleeping in the cold.\nOnly now…Persua saw the plants\nmoving.\nRising. Growing…and her eyes went wide in sudden realization and horror. Toriska moaned.\n“The Bloodfields. She woke them\nup.\n”\nThe plants were flexing, stretching, thinking that the winter had ended. It was not a slow awakening—Persua saw the first white spire slowly rising from the ground.\nIt had been maybe fifteen feet before. Now…the Watchertree rose and\nrose,\na pale trunk spearing upwards. High,\nhigher…\nit was thirty feet tall now, fifty. Seventy…\nEighty feet tall, the Watchertree was still rising—and more spires emerged out of the ground. Pale, white teeth out of dripping red lands. The Bloodfields began to buzz.",

    "text": "Ysara saw the Bloodfields\nmoving.\nAnd everyone in the [Merchant]’s caravan was screaming. They had been the moment Ryoka fired the flames from her wand.\n“[Dangersense]! Ysara—\nrun!\n”\nBuleth was screaming at her, his voice hoarse. The caravan was pivoting. They were headed—south. South and west, away from the Bloodfields. Why? Ysara didn’t understand until she saw where Ryoka and the other Runners were fighting. The area just ahead of them was waking\nup\n.\nShe was running now, but she slowed to see what was happening. She had time—the cumbersome wagons weren’t fast. Ryoka Griffin was standing there as the other three Humans wavered. And it was well they didn’t immediately move. Now they were in mortal danger.\nWatchertrees. They were active, and now—unless you had an army—\nShe had never seen the Bloodfields awake, but Ysara knew the stories. She saw the first Sporemines venting their toxic gasses into the air, leaving shimmering clouds of death. They wanted you to run. And you had to run.\nThe first swarms of insects were emerging from their homes. They buzzed into the air, in a swarm—\nand they came for the [Merchants], the largest group, first.\n“\nAbandon the wagons!\n”\n“What? Our goods—”\n“\nAbandon the wagons and get them later! Or we’ll all be dead! Get on a horse and ride!\n”\nYsara screamed at Buleth. They’d never make it up that steep incline towards Liscor—their only hope was to go south and hope the entire Bloodfields didn’t come to life.\n“\nRun!\n”\nThe Drake realized she was right. One of the [Traders] slashed the leads off a horse, but the terrified animal was already bolting. The rest tried to get on a horse or just ran—but the insects were on top of them in moments.\nAnd they were—huge.\nOne was the size of Ysara’s head and mothy—but it had\nteeth.\nIt tried to land on Buleth’s face and tear off his scales. She stabbed it through the abdomen as he screamed. She might have stabbed him—but she saved his face. He tore it off, and the cuts on his scales ran with blood. But he had no chance to thank her—\nIt was one of thousands, and more were coming. Ysara ran, slashing left and right, as the [Guards] screamed. And more were coming.\n“Gore Shambler! Gore—”\nYsara looked up as the first great beast of the Bloodfields unburied itself from the earth. Her lips moved as it disgorged soil, shambling forwards and ignoring the first arrow that buried itself in its hide.\n“Silver and steel.”\nShe looked around for Ryoka—but she couldn’t see anyone. The Runners were trapped in the midst of the Bloodfields. They were dead.",

    "text": "Persua was cowering next to one of the bug-dens, shrieking and crying as she covered her head. Claudeil was smashing smaller bugs—but he couldn’t believe he was alive. His only explanation was that Ryoka had baked this plant with her first flame spells and the bugs were flying everywhere.\nConfused in the cold—but more things were waking up. He looked around and spoke.\n“We’re leaving.”\nToriska looked up and nodded. There wasn’t any more debate. Persua’s thirst for murder—even Ryoka seemed to have forgotten the death.\nShe was standing there, just looking around at all this horror. She seemed—peaceful. Horrified—but peaceful.\n“I want to go home. I want…to go home. I don’t want this.”\nWhat was she saying? She was mad.\nClaudeil heard her speaking, as if arguing with herself. But he didn’t care.\n“Let’s\ngo.\nNorth!”\nThat was his take. South through the rest of the Bloodfields? The [Merchants] might not make it north, but they were Runners. He stood up and shakily took a few steps forwards. Then he turned back.\n“Toriska, get Persua up—”\nHe had the vague sense to grab his friend—and he turned around and took a step back. That saved his life.\nThe earth erupted, and a pale tendril as sharp as a needle and tall as he was shot\nup.\nIt scored straight through his back, laying it open and ignoring the leather armor and clothing he wore. The impact hurled Claudeil to the ground, and he lay there on his front, stunned. Then he screamed, turned—and saw it.\nThe pale spires.\nThe nearest one was about sixty feet away, towering over them all. The tendril slowly withdrew into the ground, sinking back with unnatural speed into the earth. What—what had hit—\n“\nIts roots! It’s alive! It—\n”\nToriska screamed at Claudeil, and then as he jerked up, she shouted.\n“\nDon’t move! Don’t—\n”\nIn the chaos around him, he saw something\nbound\npast him: a braying—deer? It might have been a deer, but it had too many eyes, red and bulbous, like a spider’s, and it had teeth\npointed\nlike a carnivore’s for ripping and tearing, and gnarled red horns.\nIt was chasing something he saw scuttling across the ground with a glowing body. Was that a Cr—\nBoth creatures vanished as the Watchertree struck again. The first tendril got the bug-thing.\nIt lanced the moving creature, and the stag realized it was in mortal danger. It tried to leap away, making a braying howl—\nUntil the tendril withdrew into the ground. The stag was about a hundred and twenty feet away when a lance came up from the ground again. It hit the animal in the belly and kept going straight up. And this time…\nA crimson pillar let blood soak the ground. Absorbing the blood.\nClaudeil saw the tendril leave the dead body as the blood was sucked away—and insects in the air landed and began devouring the corpse. More plants began to sense the blood, and some actually\nuprooted\nthemselves to get closer to the blood and corpse.\nInsects. Watchertrees. Death.\nThis was the Bloodfields. And it was waking up more and more. Claudeil looked around, and now he was frozen, lying on his front. Too afraid to even get up. Persua looked around.\n“We’re dead. She’s killed us. That maniac.”\nShe whispered. Toriska was just…crying.\n“Someone—where’s Lady Pathseeker. Someone—help!”\nShe looked about, but no one was coming. And Ryoka…Claudeil turned to her. She hadn’t moved. She’d seen the Watchertrees move. And he saw it on her face. Terror and—then she looked at him, and he flinched.\nRyoka Griffin stood there, inhaling, exhaling, and she finally pulled the crossbow bolt out of her leg. She drank her last healing potion and almost reached for a little vial on her belt. Or where it should be? Ryoka didn’t find it and after a second—let her hand drop.\nShe looked over at the frozen Runners. Then she smiled ruefully and, he thought, truthfully. Ryoka raised her voice.\n“We’re quits, Persua. If you make it out, that is. I never had the guts to kill you. I’m…sorry it went down this way. I’m going back. I have to try again.”\nShe\ntwitched.\nClaudeil saw Ryoka’s body turn north—then twist south. As if something were pulling her. She nearly took a step, and the Watchertree\nshivered.\nRyoka balled up her fists.\n“No.\nNo!\nI will not—\nI will not make the same mistake again. I’m going back—and nothing will stop me.\n”\nShe was glowing.\nThe City Runner stared at her with wide eyes. Was that golden writing in the air? Swirling magic—dragging her south? She pulled at it, and then Claudeil saw something burn up and down Ryoka’s arms. Like the [Merchant] with the silver sword—tattoos of magical writing? Only, this was gold and orange, fiery lines of magic that seared into his eyes.\nThey were—pulling her, like strings, south. The young woman fought them. She planted her feet—and he heard her cry out.\n“\nI refuse.\n”\nShe turned back—and he saw the magic yanking her so hard he thought it might tear the skin off her bones. But this was her or it. And she pulled and pulled—and he saw the writing glow until the magic had a choice.\nHer or it.\nAnd the spellcaster was not that—cruel—\nRyoka Griffin tore loose from something, and the geas spell\nexploded\nin the air like a burning sun. The magical words burst off her skin, flaking and disintegrating into the air with such force that even the monsters and creatures of the Bloodfields recoiled. The Watchertrees shrank and hid a moment. Then, Ryoka Griffin was free.\nShe stumbled—and then took a step. Her feet bled, and her first step looked as if it might pitch her into the ground. But then she took another and another, and her stride lengthened. In a second, she had taken six steps, and her stride was lengthening.\nShe\nran.\nRyoka Griffin ran faster than he had ever seen another Runner move. The earth erupted behind her. Once, twice—she dodged left suddenly, and the pale root of the Watchertree\nmissed\nher by a foot. She was laughing.\nShe looked alive. She looked like…a Courier. Ryoka Griffin passed by the other Runners. She ran past the awakening plants, dodging the Watchertrees by sheer speed. She—\nLeft them behind. Heading towards the fleeing [Merchants]. Away. Leaving Claudeil, Persua, and Toriska to their fate.\n“We’re going to die. This is your fault, Persua. Yours.”\nClaudeil had dared to push himself up and into a crouch as Ryoka ran past him. But now she was gone—he realized he should have tried to run with her. They needed…\n“Crossbow. Where’s my crossbow?”\n“You can’t kill that thing. It’s a\ntree!\n”\n“No, but maybe—throw it, Toriska!”\nHis friend looked at him—then realized what he meant. If they could distract the Watchertree…\nThe silent spire\nshivered\nwhen they hurled the crossbow far from them onto the grass. It\ntwitched\n—but nothing emerged from the ground. Toriska had been ready to bolt—but when nothing happened, she nearly sobbed again.\n“What? But it sensed that!”\n“It’s not alive. It must know the difference. Why isn’t it getting us?”\nThey weren’t adventurers. Maybe…Claudeil didn’t know. Maybe it thought they were the other plants and couldn’t tell the difference?\nMove and die.\nNo—\nrun\n. They had to run like Ryoka had. He turned to Persua, Toriska, and wondered if they could do it.\n“We can outrun it. All together. We break north. Got it?”\nThere were more Watchertrees, but if they got out of range of this one, they might find a path around their attack ranges. They had to do it—now.\nThe insects were growing less confused. Most were heading back to their homes—but the rest?\nThe rest were sensing that there were at least a few more things to eat here. A terrible buzzing was filling the air, but it was Persua who refused.\nShe shook her head repeatedly.\n“We can’t! I’m not that fast—\nwe’ll die.\n”\n“We have to, Persua! There’s no other chance! We’ll all go together, on three. Okay?”\nClaudeil shouted at her. He had forgotten her threats—forgotten why they had gone after Ryoka, even. He just wanted to live. He saw her head rise, and she looked more terrified than he had ever seen her.\nThen a kind of silent resolve filled her eyes. Persua looked at him, at Toriska, and her mouth opened. She closed it after a second and nodded. Then she gave him a wide, big smile.\n“I trust you. Let’s do it. On three.”\nHe slowly moved his knees around in his crouch, trying not to disturb the ground. The Watchertree was shivering as Persua looked north, and Toriska pointed.\n“That way. That’s the most direct path away. Dodge the bugs…”\nThey were descending. He saw fanged maws, huge wings, moths and…Claudeil spoke.\n“Three. Two. One—!”\nThe three friends were all tensed to run. He was ready. Like Ryoka—he saw the Runner reaching the edge of the Bloodfields. Do or die.\nLevel up. Be a—\nIn that gap between ‘one’ and ‘zero’, as they were ready to\ngo\n, Persua moved. She reached out, and with a steady hand—\npushed\nToriska, who was tensed to break into a sprint.\nPushed her hard enough that the other Runner stumbled forwards. Toriska twisted around, eyes wide, then realized her mistake. Her scream started high.\n“\nPer—\n”\nA crimson spire emerged from the earth in a flash. It ran through Toriska’s stomach, emerged from her back, and Claudeil saw his friend\ntwist\nand scream, but there was no more air. He stared at her—but then Persua was running.\n“\nRun! Run!\n”\nShe took off, around Toriska. Toriska that she had pushed—\nToriska was dead.\nClaudeil ran after Persua, and if he had a breath to scream at her—he thundered across the ground as the Watchertree sensed the motion and tried to get the other two. Persua dodged\nleft\nsuddenly, and just in time. She screamed as the ground erupted—Claudeil\njumped\nas the Watchertree’s root withdrew and felt another blow to his back.\nIt tossed him onto the ground, and he lay there, screaming and crying—but then he realized he wasn’t being impaled. He was—he looked back, and the Watchertree was shaking, but he was\nout of its range.\n“I’m alive! I…Toriska?”\nShe was lying crumpled on the ground. Bugs covered his friend. Claudeil looked back and then got to his feet.\n“Persua—”\nShe hadn’t stopped. But he began to catch up as he ran north. Around the Watchertrees—he was faster than she was. They were both breaking their personal records, though. Claudeil stared at Persua’s back as the bugs came for them. Larger creatures were shambling around, confused by the cooling Bloodfields—but the bugs were fastest.\nOne tried to take a chunk of his face off. It tore the top of an ear, and he ripped it off with his flesh, screaming.\nBut they were going to make it! Persua threw a centipede with wings off her that was trying to burrow into her flesh. They were going to—\nClaudeil saw the bug flying past him, and then Persua’s hand rose. She shot her ice-shard spell into the bugs trying to land on them, then looked at him. Their eyes met as they neared the edge of the Bloodfields, a thousand paces to safety. And he realized she was looking at him with that same big smile. And he realized—\nHe’d seen her murder Toriska. She—\nHe tried to dodge. But she shot a shard of ice into his kneecap, and he went down, screaming.\n“\nPersua!\n”\nHe would have gotten back up, but she calmly slowed down, aimed her wand, and shot him in the leg eight times. Then she tossed the spent wand aside and kept running.\n“This is her fault. Not mine. Sorry, Claudeil—”\nShe left him as, screaming, the City Runner tried to drag himself forwards. But the bugs were coming. And Persua?\nShe never looked back.",

    "text": "Ryoka Griffin emerged out of the Bloodfields and into the midst of the fleeing [Merchants]. Ysara couldn’t believe her eyes.\n“You made it?”\nRyoka seemed just as surprised by Ysara. She panted.\n“I just—I ran.”\n“\nYou woke up the Bloodfields!\nThose other Runners—murderers, Gazi the Omniscient, Gnolls—this is a disaster!”\nBuleth was babbling, almost sobbing as he looked back at his abandoned wagons and goods. But Ysara just exhaled—hard. Her chests were behind, some lying on the ground—one was on a horse that had run with them.\n“We’ll recover it when it freezes, Buleth. Hire a Courier or an adventuring team. Or before—the Bloodfields are cooling down. But there’ll be no more traffic until winter.”\nNot for them, at any rate. And Ysara doubted anyone else would want to risk it.\nThat they had escaped was purely due to their distance from the Bloodfields and the fact that it was off-season. The insects and larger monsters had retreated fast in the cold, more than they had from the magic and blades.\nFour [Guards] were down, either wounded or dead. A [Trader], Twodeals, had a huge chunk taken out of one leg, and Ysara had seen one Gnoll merchant who’d been hit by a stray arrow. It was the most merciful battle she had ever seen.\nShe herself had a gash across her collarbone, and something had taken a bite out of her hand. She only noticed the web between thumb and finger was missing when she checked the blood on her sword.\n“I’m sorry.”\nRyoka Griffin stared at the ruined caravan. She looked guilty—but even Buleth took one look at the Human’s shredded feet, the bloodstains from the crossbow bolts, and her ragged clothes and shook his head.\n“Nothing to be done. Damn Runners. At least they didn’t make it. I didn’t see more than one running, and hopefully she’s poisoned.”\n“Persua…? Then Claudeil and Toriska didn’t…”\nRyoka twisted around and gazed back. She didn’t look happy to realize that two of the Runners were dead. Ysara pointed her blade as she sipped from a potion and handed another to Ryoka.\n“I saw one taken by a Watchertree. The other fell—the bugs are all over him. Poor bastard. He might survive if he’s got a potion. If he’s lucky—he won’t have a potion.”\nShe pointed to a shape two thousand feet behind them in the red grass. She could see little things moving on him even from afar—and he was definitely alive. For now. If she hadn’t pointed Claudeil out, Ryoka would never have picked him out.\nThe Bloodfields were cooling down, and the Watchertrees were beginning to shrink back down again. But the bugs…Ysara looked around.\n“Anyone have a longbow? We could try putting him out of his misery.”\n“Let him die slow.”\nBuleth muttered. The [Traders] were flowing south, around the Bloodfields, already arguing over who to hire to collect their things. They’d need horses to either tow the broken wagons or buy new ones—recalculate their route for a southern trip.\nYsara doubted she’d see her sister or go north this winter. She had mixed feelings about it. But frankly, even if it was cold, she didn’t want to come back here. Not this year.\n“You might want to come with us, Miss Griffin. Looks like you’re going on a delivery after all. Why don’t you join us?”\nShe looked at Ryoka, and the City Runner said not a word. She was just staring at the figure in the distance. He was trying to drag himself forwards. Claudeil even got up and swung around as if drunk. Ysara thought she could hear a scream, choked. She wanted to put her fingers in her ears.\n“I have to go back. I have to say—I’m sorry.”\n“Maybe wait until the winter?”\nBuleth’s voice was sarcastic, but Ryoka Griffin just looked at the stumbling figure as he fell down again. And her voice…\n“Oh hell. I’m…”\nShe lowered the healing potion from her mouth, and Ysara saw Ryoka Griffin slowly take a step back towards the Bloodfields. This time, the Silver Merchant caught Ryoka’s arm.\n“I know you must be crazy—but you barely made it out alive. He can’t run. Those Watchertrees will get you if you slow down. There’s at least one in between you and him. He\nshot you.\nHe tried to kill you. I’m all for forgiveness, but is it worth dying?”\nThe other [Merchants] slowed down. Buleth turned in his saddle, and he looked entirely blank—until he saw where Ryoka was looking. Then his gaze turned incredulous.\n“Let him suffer. You want to try and…? That’s a terrible way for you to die.”\nClaudeil was still screaming.\nYsara knew it was true, but her eyes searched Ryoka’s face. Searched for something like her brother. Crazy nobility, the idea that he had to do the ‘right thing’. As if she were looking for the lie in the facade Ryoka was putting on.\nBut she didn’t see it. She just saw a confused young woman. Hands balled up. Breathing hard, and sweating cold in the fall air. She looked scared…but her feet were pulling her north.\nAnd this time, she gazed back at Ysara.\n“Let me try.”\n“Tell me why. And it has to be a better reason than ‘you’re not afraid of dying’. Or I swear on my levels I’ll stab you in the leg to save you from yourself.”\nThe Silver Merchant tightened her grip on Ryoka’s shoulder. The City Runner looked Ysara right in the eyes, perhaps for the first time since they’d met. And her green eyes flickered with guilt and regret.\n“I…I could let him die. He’d let me die. But I want to be better. To my friends. To—everyone. I don’t know how. I’m only good at running. I want to do something good.”\nThe [Merchants] looked at each other, and one of them laughed at her. Ysara? She looked in those earnest eyes. Then she traced the route Ryoka would have to take.\nA Watchertree closest to the edges of the Bloodfields was still standing sentinel. Even if Ryoka ran around the rest—Ysara stared at the pale tower of death. She felt the bloodsoaked hilt of her sword in one hand and exhaled slowly. Then she let go of Ryoka.\n“\nRun.\nI’ll cover you.”\nRyoka Griffin blinked. Buleth twisted around to look at Ysara.\n“\nYsara!\n”\nBut the woman was striding towards the Watchertree. Ryoka Griffin looked at Ysara, and the Silver Merchant turned her head.\n“\nI said\nrun!”\nRyoka Griffin turned. She began running, and Ysara followed her into the Bloodfields. She saw Ryoka speed up, so fast that she thought the young woman was flying across the ground.\nShe crossed under the aegis of the Watchertree—and the earth exploded under her. But she kept running, and the Watchertree missed her. She was headed straight for the Runner. Ysara?\nShe halted at the edge of the Watchertree’s perimeter, and saw Ryoka pass by the tree. But she’d have to come back. So Ysara studied the tree. She’d seen how fast it moved.\nYsara was not her brother. She was no [Knight]. Her years training as a [Warrior] were long behind her. But…she lifted the blade overhead, and silver flashed from her grip as she called out.\n“\nThis sword is the heirloom of my house.\nIt is my past. Silver and steel be my guide. In the name of the Silver Dragon!”\nThen she walked forwards onto the crimson grass. The Watchertree\nshivered\n, and Buleth shouted with the rest of the [Merchants] and [Guards].\n“\nYsara!\n”\nThe Silver Merchant stepped left, whirling in a single move as if she were on the practice courts of the keep back home. She unsheathed her sword and twirled with it in two hands. It slashed down as the first root-spike shot from the ground.\nHer sword bit deep into the Watchertree’s roots, and red ichor, thick sap, ran from the wound. Quick as a flash, it withdrew into the earth, and Ysara saw the Watchertree shaking ominously. But she was already leaping back as a second root rose.\nThe sword of an ancient family cut the air, and she was dancing, stepping, refusing to stand in one place.\n“[Quicksilver Cut].”\nHer blade was ringing with the force of trying to hew through something elastic, rubbery, hardened flesh or wood. Blood ran down her arms. Or was it sap?\nSomething struck her in the sword-shoulder.\nIt lanced straight through her flesh, and Ysara staggered. But then she took her sword in two hands again and hacked\nthrough\nthe root. When she looked up—\nShe saw Ryoka Griffin running back towards her. The Silver Merchant saw a tide of insects following her. But the young woman had Claudeil over one shoulder, and she was running—\nrunning—\nShe passed into the reach of the Watchertree, and she was slower than the first time, weighed down, tired. But Ysara was there, and Ryoka dodged the next root as the bleeding Watchertree struck. She pivoted—and swung with all her strength.\nHer blade shattered as it lodged halfway through the root, and the Watchertree\njerked,\nand she felt a tremor run through the ground as its agony made the earth shake. Ysara felt her blade\ncrack\nand shatter, and she saw the silver blade vanish, still embedded in the root. She gazed at the hilt of her broken sword. Then—Ryoka was running past her, a wide-eyed young man clinging to her, covered in blood. And Ysara?\nShe laughed. She raised the sword hilt high as she stepped back—then she threw the hilt down. The broken tip of the sword stuck in the grass. Ysara turned and walked back the way she’d come.",

    "text": "When I stop breathing hard, when my lungs stop screaming—I can’t believe I’m alive. But the Silver Merchant, Ysara, is the person I stare at.\nShe—killed a Watchertree? Or beat it. I saw her dodging the roots and cutting like some kind of heroine from stories. Even Yvlon couldn’t do that, I think. Could Gerial? Calruz?\n“Your sword—”\nI’ve cost her and the merchants their caravan. They’re still heading south, although they’ve stopped to pour healing potions on Claudeil. He’s alive. He’s staring at me, and I…\n“Forget it. I never liked it, anyways. It’s just a sword. I used it for something worthy. I think even my father would be proud.”\nThere’s a hole in her shoulder, and she looks like she’s badly hurt. But Ysara gives me a smile and—\nshe’s so badass.\nI want to thank her. I have to—but Ysara just looks north.\n“If you’re going to make it, that Watchertree will probably be dangerous in an hour or less. I’ve just wounded it. If you come south, I’d love the company. I’ll wager we’ll get free drinks enough to recoup my losses, at least.”\nShe winks at me, and I waver. But Ysara is looking north, and I stare back the way I’ve come.\nLiscor.\nLiscor, right? I’m shaking. I’m—sad that Toriska is dead. I look at Claudeil. He’s panting, staring at me like an idiot.\n“She tried to get me killed. Persua. You…why’d you come back for me?”\n“I don’t know.”\nHe looks at me as confused as I am. But Ysara just exhales. She rubs at her shoulder as one of the [Guards] presses a rag dipped in potion onto it.\n“You—Claudeil?”\nHe flinches because\nnone\nof the [Merchants] look happy to see him. But Ysara just points down at him.\n“You won’t be going north. That girl—Persua? Did she get away?”\n“I think so. I…”\nIs she going to kill him? Buleth, the Drake, looks ready to, but Ysara’s lip just twists.\n“Swear on a truth stone you’ll never join her. Swear—and we’ll settle your debts like [Merchants]. We’ll take care of him.”\nShe nods at me. I hope that doesn’t mean he’ll be tortured—but it sounds like they have an idea. Buleth nods sharply.\n“We’re not Roshal. We’ll just work you like Lizardfolk. Maybe we’ll make him grab our Chests of Holding.”\n“Later. Let’s get out of here. Miss Ryoka?”\nShe knows. I’m shaking again, and I’m trying not to cry.\n“I should stay and thank you—”\nYsara’s eyes are pale silver and faintly, faintly, brown. She smiles at me.\n“Do you have more people you need to apologize to? Your friends?”\n“Yes.”\nHer and the Horns and…the Silver Merchant points a bloody finger along the Bloodfields. The wounded Watchertree is half-buried in the ground. It’s dangerous—but the magic on me is broken.\n“Then go and apologize to them. Then—when we meet, you can thank me in person. I will see you again, someday. Next year or later. [Merchants], like Runners, go everywhere.”\nShe is so. Cool.\nThen Ysara offers me a hand, and I take it. I turn—and despite my wounds, despite all of it, I feel—what’s the word?\nShriven? Lighter? At peace? Nothing is perfect.\nBut I want to try.\nSo I begin to run. I run and run—back the way I’ve come. There’s nothing for me this way. Only death and some kind of meaningless thrill before I die.\nMy friends are back there. I want to meet them. I want…",

But the Horns of Hammerad were still out of bed and racing downstairs within seconds of hearing it.\nA cloud of black smoke billowed out of the kitchen as Erin stumbled out, hacking and coughing. Toren followed her, holding a smoking, flaming pan. He charged outside, and the Horns of Hammerad saw him hurl the pan to the ground and begin stomping on whatever had been inside.\nThe smoke began to clear a bit, but it still stung the eyes. The smell of burnt grease and charcoal lingered unpleasantly in the air.\nErin stared up at the adventurers staring down at her from the staircase. She grinned weakly and waved.\n“Oh. Hi. Um.

    "text": "Much to Erin’s surprise, the Horns of Hammerad actually knew what pancakes were. Apparently, pancakes weren’t a product of the modern age, and so she served several heaping plates to her guests until they were all full.\nPancakes were fun. Pancakes were easy to make. Erin could let Toren stir the batter together while she cooked them on a pan over the fire. She used a spatula and oiled her pan well to get the pancakes to stop sticking. She’d tried flipping it like chefs did on TV, but she stopped after the pancakes kept landing on Toren and the fire.\nShe joined them for the last bit of the meal once she’d reached a critical mass of pancake. Erin munched on her food as the adventurers ate their way back into the waking world.\n“What was all that about?”\nErin looked at the bald mage and tried to remember his name. Soulstorm? It was something like that.\n“Oh, uh, I was trying to teach him how to cook.”\nErin pointed to Toren as the skeleton walked into the room with a pitcher of milk. She accepted a refill of the glass as the other adventurers stared at her.\n“What? I thought it would be easy. Fun fact: it’s not.”\n“A skeleton…cooking?”\n“Well, he already does all the other chores. If he could do stuff like make eggs, stir soup, and flip pancakes, it’d make my life even easier. But, uh, skeletons don’t really understand the difference between ‘cooked’ and ‘burned’.”\nGerial exchanged a glance with the half-Elf and shook his head. But Ceria looked intrigued.\n“It’s not a bad idea. I’m still not sure what Pisces was thinking, giving you only one skeleton as a guard, but I suppose that’s all your mana supply could take.”\nErin froze, fork stuck in her food.\n“My what? I don’t have any magic. I mean, I can’t use magic.”\nCeria frowned at Erin.\n“Really? Who told you that?”\n“Pisces.”\n“Ah. But I wasn’t talking about spellcasting. I just meant your internal mana supply.”\nCeria looked around and saw blank faces around her, except for the other mage.\n“Oh come on. You all know you have magic inside of you, right?”\nGerial looked down at his stomach, bemused.\n“We do?”\n“Of course. Magic is part of us. It’s in the air we breathe, the food we eat—we all have our own supply of mana, however small. My kind has a great deal of internal magic we generate simply by existing, so we make good mages. Humans on the other hand—”\nShe shrugged and bit into a piece of pancake. She chewed and spoke around her food.\n“Not as much. But exceptions exist, and they make good mages. But even if you don’t cast spells, you have some mana in you. Enough to sustain basic spells or supply a summoned creature with enough magic to survive if it can’t by itself.”\n“So I have magic? In me? Does that mean if Toren wasn’t here I’d—be able to cast spells?”\nCeria paused and shook her head sympathetically.\n“I’m sorry. But if Pisces tested you, it’s unlikely. Maybe there’s a better chance, but…”\n“Oh.”\nErin said it quietly. She kept eating in silence as the other adventurers spoke.\n“I’d like to go into the city and collect our share of the supplies. We also need to visit the Adventurer’s Guild to make sure we’re still cleared to enter the ruins. But, ah, we can’t go if that adventurer is still around.”\nCalruz scowled as he ate two pancakes in a single bite.\n“Gazi the Omniscient. It would be inconvenient if she were to trouble us now. I will go with you.”\nErin blinked and looked up from her plate.\n“Gazi? Oh, she’s gone.”\nThe other Horns of Hammerad stared at her.\n“Are you sure?”\n“Yeah. She told me she was going and looking for something. Somewhere else.”\nErin was aware of the other adventurers sharing a look at the table, but she didn’t understand what it meant. It was just a look that told you it was significant but didn’t share any of the details. It could be that it was a look to signify the world was changing and those present were at the precipice of a new era. Or it could be a look to subtly acknowledge some unlucky person had stepped in dog poo and hadn’t noticed. You couldn’t tell.\n“Well then, that makes things simpler. At least for now.”\nGerial shook his head and stood up from the table.\n“We’ll see if anything else needs doing in the city. Calruz, do you still want to join us?”\nThe Minotaur snorted.\n“There is no need to waste any more time with useless chattering and polishing weapons. Tomorrow, we fight. Tell the others I will be ready when the time comes.”\nThe adventurers nodded and began trooping out the door. Erin stared at their dirty dishes and pointed silently to Toren and then at the table. The skeleton obediently walked over and began to gather them.\nCalruz was still eating, but Erin could hear the other adventurers debating how to spend their last day. Some were in favor of buying trinkets to send to family, others to see what kind of entertainment was available in the city. Erin clearly heard Gerial talking casually to the others as he closed the door behind him.\n“That’s odd. Was that large rock there yesterday?”\nErin shot up in her seat.\n“Wait!”\nShe threw the door open and caught the adventurers as they were descending the hill. Erin desperately waved her arms at them and shouted incoherently.\n“Stop! Hold it! Don’t go any further!”\nThey turned and stared. Erin pointed with a trembling finger at the large, conspicuously inconspicuous boulder casually blocking their path towards the city.\n“Stay right there! If the rock moves, hit it or cast a spell or something!”\n“Hit the rock?”\nPerplexed, Gerial and the other adventurers stared at the hidden Rock Crab. Ceria, on the other hand, narrowed her eyes and took a few steps back.\nErin rushed inside her inn and came out a few seconds later with a basket full of seed cores. Calruz followed her and stared at the giant boulder.\n“What are you worried about?”\nErin grabbed one of the seed cores carefully and held it in one hand. She pointed at the boulder as she glared at Calruz.\n“There’s a monster down there.”\nHe squinted.\n“I don’t see it. Is it hiding in the ground?”\n“No!”\nErin pointed again.\n“See that? That thing?”\nCalruz looked. He frowned.\n“That is a boulder. What of it?”\nCeria coughed.\n“It’s actually not, Calruz. It’s a monster, hiding under the rock. What you’re actually looking at is a shell.”\nThe other adventurers reacted to that news. Several swore, and those holding weapons backed up as they gripped their weapon hilts.\n“Are you sure?”\nThe half-Elf nodded. Her wise, half-Elven eyes…looked pointedly at the edge of the rock, devoid of moss or other signs the rock had been rooted in the ground for a long time, and Erin’s face.\n“I didn’t see it at first, but there’s definitely something odd about that boulder. It looks too—out of place. See how the grass is flattened around it? And it hasn’t sunk into the earth as it should have over time.”\nGerial frowned as he half-unsheathed his sword.\n“I believe you, but my [Dangersense] hasn’t gone off.”\n“Not everything trips [Dangersense]. And if it’s a sneak attack, you’d have to be right next to the creature, and by that point, you’d be dead.”\nHe blew out his mustache.\n“Fair point. Well, how do you want to tackle it? Freezing spells and then we charge in?”\nCalruz nodded. He reached for his axe.\n“I’ll break its shell.”\n“No need.”\nTo the adventurers’ surprise, Erin walked forwards.\n“I can totally scare it off.”\nCalruz’s face was a statement of incredulity.\n“Impossible.”\n“Watch me.”\nErin took aim and threw. Her first seed core splattered harmlessly against the Rock Crab’s shell. The second and third did the same as blue-gray seeds and liquid began trickling down the side of the boulder.\nThe adventurers were just starting to fidget in place when the Rock Crab suddenly lurched to its feet. They immediately readied their weapons, but the giant crab began scuttling away as Erin threw several more Seed Cores after it. Courtesy of her Skill, each one struck the shell until the Rock Crab scuttled over a hilltop and disappeared.\nErin turned, smiling, and saw the Horns of Hammerad staring at her, slack-jawed.\n“\nHow\ndid you do that?”\nShe showed them the seed cores and explained about the strange trees in the orchard she’d found. Ceria frowned at the small cores.\n“I think I know what you’re talking about. Can I see one of those, ah, seed cores?”\n“Here.”\nErin casually tossed a seed core at Ceria. The half-Elf yelped, desperately grabbed the pod, and held it gingerly in her hands as if it were a live grenade.\n“Tree kissing\nrot\n! Don’t\ndo\nthat!”\n“Why?”\nCeria’s hand shook as she very carefully held the seed core in her hand. Her’s eyes bulged.\n“We’ve been\ndrinking\nthis? Are you\ninsane?\n”\n“Just the outer part! I know how to pick ones where the core isn’t broken! Honest! You’re not dead, so I’m right.”\nErin hurried to reassure Ceria. The half-Elf looked pale, but after a while, she accepted that Erin probably hadn’t poisoned them.\nGerial frowned at the seed cores in Erin’s basket, confused.\n“That explains why the crab ran off. But why is it afraid of a tiny bit of poison? It’s a lot bigger than we are.”\n“It must not have strong resistance to poison. Either that or it has no way to reduce the buildup of toxins like we do. Those crab-creatures might carry the sickness within them for the rest of their lives if they’re not careful.”\nGerial and the other adventurers muttered as Erin handed Toren the seed cores to put back in the inn. This time, far away from the kitchen.\n“Well, you saved our hides from a nasty encounter. That thing was big, and I don’t relish wasting any more healing potions before we go into the ruins.”\n“Mm.”\nCalruz folded his arms and stared at the place where the Rock Crab had been. He didn’t appear particularly impressed.\n“Go, then. I will remain here.”\nCeria and the others eyed him curiously.\n“Doing what? Sleeping?”\n“No. Teaching.”",

    "text": "“Only Calruz would think about teaching an [Innkeeper] to fight.”\nGerial shook his head as he and Ceria pushed their way into the local Adventurer’s Guild in Liscor. The building was far smaller than they were used to and bustling with activity. Countless Bronze-rank adventurers were trying to turn in bounties on monsters or take the few requests posted on the jobs board.\n“Here.”\nCeria pointed, and the two got into the shortest line. They kept talking as a harried-looking Drake receptionist dealt with the adventurers in front of them.\n“I mean, why does she need training? You saw how she handled that crab thing.”\n“That’s not the same as knowing how to fight. And besides, those seed cores won’t do much good against a group of bandits or even a few Goblins.”\nCeria had to raise her voice to talk over the hubbub in the room. The receptionist in front of them had a loud voice, and she was using it liberally as she dealt with the line in front of them.\n“Look, I don’t care how the Human cities do it. We don’t give out bounties for beating up [Thugs]. How do you know they were guilty anyways? Did you just beat up some kids? In the future, let the Watch take care of it. Next!”\n“Still. Do you think he’s going to teach her how to use a weapon? In a day?”\n“It’s Calruz. He probably expects Erin to be like Minotaur children. They grow up knowing how to use a blade.”\n“Evil Goblins? Robbing you? And what are we supposed to do about it? Go and post a bounty if you’re that upset. But they’re\nGoblins.\nGo grab a sword and deal with it yourself!”\n“I hope he goes easy on her. I’d hate for him to hurt her accidentally.”\n“You Humans. Always so worried. She’s survived this far. Calruz won’t kill her by the time we get back. Probably.”\n“No, there are no more requests available. Sorry. Next! You two, the Human and, er, pointy-eared Human! I’m assuming you’re a half-Elf, but let me know if I’m wrong.”\nGerial and Ceria looked up. Selys waved at them, and they approached.\n“What can I do for you? And if it’s about lodging or supplies, don’t bother. The Guild is all out of everything.”\n“No, ah, it’s not that, Miss.”\nGerial cleared his throat and smiled at Selys. The Drake did not return the smile.\n“We’re part of the Horns of Hammerad. We—and four other teams—put in a request a few days ago to enter the ruins as part of an expedition. We were wondering if we had permission—”\n“Oh, you’re\nthat\nlot.”\nSelys’s eyes widened, and she stared at Gerial and Ceria.\n“You’re one of the first non-Drake Silver-rank teams we’ve had in the city in a while. I expected you’d be bigger. And don’t you have a Minotaur in your group?\nPlease\ndon’t let him cause any damage.”\nShe rushed on before either adventurer could respond.\n“Anyways, the Guild already approved your request, so there’s nothing to worry about. Go right ahead.”\nBoth Ceria and Gerial exchanged a quizzical glance. Gerial cleared his throat.\n“Um. We don’t need any seals? Any letters or proof we can enter?”\nThis time, it was Selys’ turn to look confused.\n“Why would you need anything like that? You’re adventurers, right? Just go out and kill monsters and try not to get killed.”\n“Oh it’s just—”\n“It’s just that in Human cities, adventuring is a lot more regulated.”\nCeria leaned over the counter and smiled at Selys.\n“We don’t want to cause any trouble, being outsiders and all.”\nSelys smiled at Ceria, her eyes flicking to the half-Elf’s pointed ears.\n“Well, I appreciate that. Most of you Humans—er, the Humans we get don’t obey many of our laws. If you could clear out those ruins so they all go away, I think the city would throw you a celebration.”\n“Something to look forwards to. We’re heading in tomorrow. So just to clarify—there’s nothing we need to do?”\nSelys waved one hand.\n“You’re fine. Go in whenever you like—just don’t bring any trouble out with you. The Watch is busy enough as it is.”\nShe turned to call for the next adventurer when another Drake walked over and put a hand on Selys’ shoulder. The other Drake murmured in Selys’ ear. She called out to Gerial and Ceria as they were about to leave.\n“Wait! You two!”\nThey turned. Selys flashed them another smile.\n“Sorry, but you’re from the north, aren’t you? There’s an annoying Human [Messenger] in the city, and he keeps bothering people.”\n“Oh?”\nIntrigued, Gerial and Ceria returned to the counter. Gossip and rumor were the lifeblood of an adventurer, and they were always curious about politics, even in cities like Liscor.\n“Apparently, he’s come representing some flower. No—oh! I see. House Reinhart. That makes more sense.”\nSelys rolled her eyes. She seemed to vaguely recognize the name, but that was all. For the Humans of the north—\n“\nHouse Reinhart?\nWhich Lady?”\nThe [Receptionist]’s overworked shrug said it all. This wasn’t even her\njob—\nbut because her grandmother was the Adventurer Guild’s [Guildmistress], sometimes people came to her to ask for help.\n“I didn’t ask. That’s what he’s saying. He wants to talk to someone important. Well, we have a Council, but they’re not going to listen to every Human noble who comes calling. But he’s persistent, and he won’t go away. Is this important?”\n“It’s one of the Five Families!”\n“The—oh, yeah. I know. But it’s the north’s Five Families. They don’t have any power here. You’re lucky I recognized it—I don’t even think I could name all five.”\nIf anything, realizing this came from a northern power seemed to make the Drakes less inclined to want to hear the [Messenger] out. But Ceria had a feeling she knew exactly who was asking—\n“You don’t know the Five Families by heart?”\nSelys rolled her eyes and twitched her tail in annoyance. She glowered at Sostrom. Sostrom, who didn’t know about Gazi of Reim, but who\ndid\nknow about this.\n“Listen. They’re your Five Families. Not mine. You want me to name all six Walled Cities? I can do that. Any child could. I think I have them. It’s Reinhart, Veltras, El…no, wait…”\nGerial took over for her with a smile as she frowned.\n“The Reinharts, Veltras, Terland, Wellfar, and El families were the first Humans to ever settle on this continent. They were aristocracy—related to kings from the continent Terandria. They’re still very rich and influential today.”\nSelys nodded, moderately grateful to him.\n“See? I knew that. Just not their names. Like—El? What kind of name is that? You Humans and your strange names.”\nShe shook her head and continued.\n“—I know they’re influential, but Liscor isn’t ruled by Human nobility. They literally have no power here, and so if some ‘Reinhart’ wants to talk to the Council…”\nHer look said that it sounded like a pain and no wonder the Council didn’t want to deal with it. Not that Liscor’s Council did much. But Ceria now stepped in and leaned over the counter. The busy [Receptionists], the Drake asking for Selys’ advice, weren’t too interested. Until Ceria said the other name, which the [Messenger] should have led with.\n“What about\nMagnolia\nReinhart?”\nIt was a fallacy of Izril’s northern Humans to think that the Five Families’ names would instantly carry as much weight as they did in the north. But the other name?\nGerial saw Selys’ head snap up in an instant. Her quill stopped writing notes in her ledger as her eyes widened.\n“\nMagnolia Reinhart?\nWait, you think it’s her?”\n“What’s the difference? She’s House Reinhart, and it is probably her.”\nSostrom was still peeved, but Selys gave him a look as if the man were stupid.\n“Reinhart nothing. Lady\nMagnolia\nwas the one who fought in the Antinium Wars! She broke the siege of Liscor! Naane—\nrun\nto the Council! Tell them it’s her, not some random [Lady]! Of all the stupid—she’s like the one Human we’d hear out!”\nIn Drake lands, she was one of a handful of Humans you’d know. Tyrion Veltras, perhaps, the war-leader, Magnolia Reinhart—maybe another matriarch like Maviola El—but Magnolia was the only one who might even possibly be respected.\nThe other receptionist practically sprinted out of the building. Selys stared at her back and then shook her head. She looked at the Horns, and they gazed at her, looking slightly triumphant. Though they, ironically, didn’t know Magnolia’s full weight in Liscor. Selys stared at the heaving room of mostly Humanity and sighed. Then she smiled at Gerial and raised her voice.\n“Next!”",

    "text": "Erin made a fist with her hands. She raised it and prepared to punch. Then she hesitated.\n“Aren’t you going to block?”\nCalruz shook his head.\n“Give me your strongest punch. I wish to feel it.”\nErin nodded. She raised her fist again and then hesitated again.\n“You’re\nsure\nI can hit you?”\nCalruz snorted impatiently.\n“If you can injure me, I will hang up my axe and cease living as a warrior this instant.”\n“Fine then. You asked for it!”\nErin clenched her hand tightly. She breathed in and out quickly a few times, trying to psyche herself up. Somehow, even though Calruz was just standing in the grass outside of her inn, he suddenly looked\nhuge\n—that was, even taller than he already was.\nThree hundred pounds and closer to seven feet than six of solid Minotaur loomed over Erin. She took a deep breath and attacked.\n“Hi\nyah!\n”\nErin tried to punch hard and fast. Her fist struck Calruz in his stomach, and she yelped.\n“Ow!”\nHis abs were like\nstone.\n“Try again.”\nErin did. Her fist bounced off of Calruz’s stomach.\n“Ow! Why do I feel like I’m hurting myself more than you?”\n“Your form is terrible.”\n“Thanks.”\n“It is not a compliment.”\nCalruz sighed.\n“Do you not even know how to punch properly?”\nErin stared at him.\n“Is there a way to punch right? Don’t you just make a fist and—”\nShe punched at the air and then saw Calruz’s expression.\n“Well, I don’t\nknow!\nI’ve never been in a fight before I came here!”\nThis time, it was Calruz’s turn to eye Erin.\n“Never?”\n“Never.”\n“What about your creature? Surely it knows how to do battle.”\nCalruz pointed at Toren, who was silently watching him teach Erin. The skeleton made a fist. It looked okay to Erin, but Calruz took one look and shook his head.\n“That neither you nor your—\npet\nknow how to defend yourselves is a shame. Were you never taught how to fight?”\nThe Minotaur looked both surprised and disgruntled. He shook his head unhappily.\n“I see I have much to teach you. Starting with how to strike.”\n“What about your skill? That [Hammer Blow] attack was amazing! How about you teach me how to do that?”\n“Someone who cannot even punch properly would never learn a Skill.”\nThat made sense, but Erin had more questions. She hadn’t really been able to ask Calruz yesterday, what with having to cook dinner.\n“Okay, your skill is super-advanced. But\nhow\ndo you do it? I mean, is it magic?”\nCalruz snorted.\n“I am no mage. That was a Skill. It allows me to transcend my hardest strike and turn it into something even stronger.”\n“Yeah…I still don’t get it.”\nErin pointed at Calruz’s axe.\n“If you swing that thing as hard as you can, how can you somehow hit\nharder\nthan your hardest hit? Um. What I meant was—”\n“It is the act of exceeding one’s limits.”\nCalruz tapped the handle of the axe on his back. Toren had barely managed to get it out of the ground, but the Minotaur swung it around easily.\n“There is art in this. My kind practices little magic. There are war mages, and we do study in places like Wistram—but we respect martial ability more often.”\nHe snorted dismissively.\n“Nevertheless, we respect the art of war in magic, engineering, and all forms. We understand honing one’s techniques, learning systematically. And this—we understand the flow of combat. To learn and use such Skills, you must forget your frailties and strike with heart.”\n“That sounds deep. Like a martial art.”\nErin expected him to give her a blank look, but the Minotaur only smiled, and his blue eyes lit up a bit.\n“The House of Minos learned from [Martial Artists] to create the basis of our hand-to-hand training. I am surprised you know of it. Most Izrilians are ignorant [Brawlers]. What do you know of such things?”\nErin was the one flat-footed, and she tried to gesture and do karate-chops.\n“I know it’s good! It’s sort of like…um…a way to fight with your hands? You kick and punch in special ways. And footwork and stuff.”\nCalruz actually winced as he watched her, but he gave a slow nod.\n“That…proves you know what it is, if nothing of it.”\n“Hey! Fair.”\nHe went on.\n“I know a Human who fights with her fists. She is…skilled. But wild. And she does not understand. She fights with cunning and grace, but she only fights at her limit. She does not think she can go further. Thus—she never will.”\nHe stared off into the distance.\n“She lacks vision. I will make her understand that.”\nThat made no sense to Erin, but it was nice to see that Calruz had a crush on someone. She just hoped whomever it was appreciated big…bull guys. Somehow, she had doubts about his romantic prospects, but she continued asking questions.\n“So what’s the key behind a Skill opposed to just fighting good? Desire?”\nCalruz returned to their discussion, which was, Erin realized, straying from what she’d hear from some practitioner on Earth. There was—ability to fight—and\nSkills.\nAnd it was Skills that Calruz was trying to teach her about.\n“Not just desire. It is the refinement of a single strike into a moment of perfection. But that is something far beyond you at this moment. For now, you must learn to punch.”\nHe held up a massive hand, twice as big as hers, palm towards her.\n“Strike my palm. I will show you how to attack properly.”\nErin made a fist. Calruz immediately shook his head.\n“Not like that. You will break your fingers if you strike unevenly.”\nHe held up his other hand and made a fist. It looked like a furry brick, and Erin wondered what would happen if he hit her with it.\n“Like this. Strike with your knuckles here and\nhere.\nAnd keep your thumb outside your fist.”\nCalruz pointed to Erin’s index and ring fingers, demonstrating with his own fist. She copied him, awkwardly shifting her fingers into the right positions.\n“And then when you strike, step forwards and move your hips like so.”\nHe shifted his hips as he threw a lightning-fast jab. Erin blinked. She\nfelt\nthe wind from his arm.\n“Okay let me try. Like—this?”\nShe punched his hand. It felt better, somehow. She could put more weight into it. Calruz grunted and nodded.\n“Again.”\nErin punched again and again, switching hands at his directive. He nodded after a few more tries.\n“Good. That is the proper technique. Now—kick!”\nHe showed Erin how to kick at his midsection and had her try. Twice, she fell down, but after about ten minutes, she was kicking hard enough to make him block with two hands rather than one.\n“Now, the skeleton. Punch it.”\nErin eyed Toren. He immediately raised his hands like Calruz, but the Minotaur pointed at him.\n“You. Thing. Dodge her.”\nThe skeleton turned its head to Calruz silently, as if wondering whether it should obey. But it started dodging left and right.\n“Try to strike it.”\nErin did. Toren dodged. He was quite quick. She punched and kicked, but he kept on dodging.\n“You are painfully slow. Move faster! Don’t strike where he is, but where he will be.”\nCalruz gave her advice—or insulted her as Erin tried, sweating. She punched at Toren, and he leaned back effortlessly.\n“Fast. Faster. Pull back your arm quickly.”\nErin chased Toren around fruitlessly for a few minutes and then stopped and glared at Calruz.\n“Why am I learning to fight with my fists? Shouldn’t I be using a sword?”\nHe shook his head.\n“I am teaching you a basic truth. You must know how to fight without weapons, or it will be a weakness others will exploit. Besides, you understand nothing of the flow of combat. You must learn to strike your opponent before you are worthy of using a blade.”\nHe looked at Toren. The skeleton wasn’t winded from dodging Erin, having no lungs to worry about, but Erin was sweaty and gasping for air.\n“Very well. We shall try something else. The skeleton shall guard, and you will break through. Punch him, kick him. Destroy your opponent.”\nSomething about the way he said that bothered Erin. She squared up against Toren and tried a punch. This time, the skeleton blocked it.\n“Ow.”\n“If you break your fingers or cut your skin, there are potions. Keep attacking.”\nErin did. Toren had a harder time blocking her. She was stronger than he was, which was odd to think of. Erin punched, and he shifted backwards in the grass slightly as his arm caught her fist. She kicked, and he stumbled.\nErin waited for Toren to regain his balance, which earned her a roar of disapproval from Calruz.\n“Don’t stop! Press the attack! Your goal is to defeat your enemy.\nHurt him.\nMercy is a luxury only the strong can afford. Attack until he lies in pieces.”\nAgain, the words bothered Erin. But she punched anyways. It was easy. So long as Toren just blocked and didn’t jump around, she could feint a punch and then\nkick",

    "text": "This time, her foot kicked one leg out from under the skeleton. He fell to one knee, and Erin stepped forwards and punched him in the face. His head twisted sideways. Erin ignored the stinging in her hand and raised it again to knock him down.\nShe stared down at the empty skull and froze. For a second, she was on the ground staring up at a Goblin Chieftain with a sword in his hands. She smelled burning flesh.\nShe remembered. She remembered another face. Klbkch. And a pool of green blood. She held him in her arms as he died.\nSlowly, Toren righted himself and got to his feet. He stared at Erin—as did Calruz. She couldn’t know that her face had gone deadly white or that she was suddenly shaking.\n“I can’t do this.”\nCalruz shook his head.\n“You must. You must learn to fight.”\n“No.”\nErin shook her head, or was it her entire body that shook? She felt sick. She was close to throwing up.\n“I can’t. I’m no warrior.”\nUnbidden, the words she’d dreamed of spoke themselves. Her childhood rhyme.\n“The king is smart and uses his head. For if he moves, he’ll soon be dead.”\nCalruz stared at her.\n“What does that mean?”\n“It means—it means that whenever I got into trouble before, I always got people killed. Or I killed. I nearly died. I can’t do it. Better to just let Toren learn to fight. Teach him instead.”\nErin pointed at Toren. The skeleton nodded, but Calruz shook his head.\n“Your king. In times of need, even he defends himself, does he not?”\nHe meant real kings, but it was true of chess as well.\n“Only as a last resort.”\n“This is the last resort I speak of. Someday, you will surely be alone and without anyone to protect you. Will you die then or fight?”\nErin didn’t have any good comeback to that. She bowed her head until the Minotaur murmured.\n“Striking a downed opponent may be wrong.”\nThere was something in Calruz’s voice that made Erin look up. He didn’t bark his next few words but spoke more quietly, choosing them carefully.\n“Perhaps—yes. There is more honor in you than I thought. Very well. I have little time, so I shall simply teach you to fight. If you practice against your creature, you may learn the basics quickly enough.”\nHe gestured, and Toren raised his guard again.\n“The skeleton will block. Simply strike at him. He is dead, so it matters little what you do. Forget death and battle for the moment. Simply know the purity of combat.”\nThat sounded better. Erin nodded and stood straight. She made a fist, and Toren blocked.\n“That doesn’t mean strike like a pathetic weakling! Hit harder!”\nErin did.\n“Ow.”\nIt wasn’t as if there were any soft part on Toren to hit. Erin punched again, and her fist collided with his bony arm.\n“Ow.”\nAfter a few minutes, Calruz had Erin learn to block. This time, Toren attacked, striking her hands and arms hard. But it was easy. Surprisingly easy to see everything coming. Erin’s arms hurt, but the skeleton never landed a punch or kick on her. He was probably taking it easy like Calruz, but the Minotaur seemed approving.\n“Now—a spar.”\n“Can’t we rest instead?”\nErin complained as she rubbed at her arms. She needed a healing potion. She could already feel the bruises.\n“No. Consider this a final test. Both of you—spar with each other. You are a good match. Equally weak. Well, the skeleton knows how to fight, but it should be good practice.”\nShe wanted to protest, but arguing with Calruz was\nworse\nthan trying to shift a stubborn bull. Erin stumbled towards Toren as the skeleton raised his guard. He feinted at her. Mechanically, she blocked.\nBlocking was easy. Punching was easy. It was too easy. Fighting was—wasn’t something Erin liked.\nToren kicked at her chest, and Erin’s arm was pushed away. He punched her in the breast.\n“Ow! Hey—”\nHis fist caught her in the jaw. Erin stumbled and then got mad. She caught his fist and slugged Toren in the head. This time, he stepped back. The skeleton carefully eyed Erin and then charged.\nThat was too fast. And he’d never tried that on Erin. But she was angry now. She stepped sideways at the last moment and rammed him from the side. Toren went sprawling, and Erin kicked him in the ribs as he was getting up.\nShe didn’t see how Calruz’s eyes widened as she blocked Toren as he rapidly struck at her face and sides, kicking, punching without landing a hit on her. Erin was just acting on instinct. Toren was so\nslow\n. He was a fighting machine, but he fought like a machine. He wasn’t original.\nShe stomped on his foot and pushed him down. Toren rolled as she kicked at him and leapt to his feet. He feinted at her face. Erin didn’t move. She could\ntell\nit was fake. Toren pulled his fist back, confused. Erin hit him futilely in the shoulder. The problem was that she couldn’t really hurt him. He was all bones.\nBut she\nwas\nwinning. She could feel it.\nErin was still sick. And tired. And her hands hurt. But there was something else there, too.\nFrustration. And a bit of anger.\nNo—not just a bit. A quiet ocean, sitting just below the depths of Erin’s thoughts. A part of her hated violence. But another part was relieved she\ncould\nfight back. It wanted her to never be helpless. It was anger and something else.\nAnd it felt—good to let it out.\nToren punched and received a cross-counter to the face. Erin didn’t know that was what she did. She just saw the opening and took it.\nShe kicked, and Toren blocked. She dodged a fist to her side and slapped his arm down before hitting his arms as he covered his face.\nHis guard was faltering. Erin felt a rush of energy. She punched faster, putting her hips into the blow like Calruz had shown her. More strength. She was stronger than Toren, thanks to her Skill.\nShe just wanted to knock that stupid skeleton down. He kept coming at her, again and again. It didn’t matter that she hit him. He was dead, and he had no flesh to bruise. But he didn’t hold back, and her arms were hurting.\nToren had just kicked Erin’s leg, and she was staggering. But she saw him run at her, and something in her mind\nclicked\n. She stood up, raised her hand, took one step, and\nkicked\n.\nOne of Toren’s legs broke. Not the bones themselves—but the leg disconnected, and the skeleton went down. He raised his arms and saw Erin’s fist flying at his head.\nShe felt it. A perfect strike. A moment of truth. Erin put her entire body into one hit, throwing her entire weight into a strike that smashed right through Toren’s guard and crashed into where his nose would have been if he was alive.\nThud\n.\nHis head detached. In slow motion, Erin saw the skeleton’s head fly off the body. She stared as Toren’s head flew off the top of the hill, bounced down the incline, and rolled to a stop fifty feet away.\nErin stared at the upright torso of Toren in shock. After a second, it buckled and fell down.\nShe stared at her hand. She’d opened up the skin on her knuckles, and she was bleeding. But she’d felt it. She’d hit Toren harder than she’d ever hit—or done—anything in her life. She’d felt it.\nErin stared around. She wanted to know if that was what Calruz was talking about. She looked at the Minotaur. He was gaping at her, mouth wide open, eyes bulging.\nAfter a few moments, Calruz closed his mouth. He stared at Toren and then at Erin. He cleared his throat a few times and then looked at Erin.\n“…Can you do that again?”",

    "text": "“Take a good look at this.”\nGerial whistled and beckoned to Ceria. She broke off her conversation with Yvlon, and both women walked over to see what was so interesting.\nCervial held up a massive crossbow, sleek black metal and pointed death. It wasn’t currently loaded, of course, but just by looking, the two adventurers could see how much power it had.\nHe grinned at Yvlon and held it out to her. She accepted it carefully and stared curiously at the device.\n“Where did you get\nthat\nfrom, Cervial? I’ve never seen a crossbow made like that.”\nHe beamed ear-to-ear as she inspected it.\n“That’s because this one is made by Dwarves. Custom-ordered. Ever seen one this nice, Gerial? It’s like a bow, but one that you can load and wait until you need to shoot. This one’s a piece of art. Pure Dwarfsteel, straight from the forges of Deríthal-Vel.”\nGerial took the bow from Yvlon as Ceria rolled her eyes. The man exclaimed.\n“Beautiful. Crossbow Stan’s got the best ones I’ve seen, and he’ll go green with jealousy when he sees yours. What’s the range compared to a bow…? We should have you and Marian compete for range and accuracy and power.”\nCeria wasn’t as impressed as the other two Humans, but listened readily enough as Cervial extolled the virtues of the device.\n“It cost nearly every gold piece we had, but it was worth it. We cracked the armor of a Stone Golem with one shot, and we’ve brought down more shielded enemies than I can count with this.”\n“And this is your trump card for the expedition?”\n“We might be at a disadvantage if we run into tight corridors, but with this, we’ll be able to pull our weight.”\n“Well, we’re all set here. We’ve got a battle plan worked out, and my team and The Horns of Hammerad are set. Menes says his folks have enough mana potions. The only group not accounted for is Gregor’s. Where is he?”\nCervial grinned.\n“Gregor is busy going through the last adventurers clamoring to join the expedition. He says he’ll probably turn them all down, but you never know who’ll turn up.”\nGerial reluctantly handed the crossbow back to Cervial. He could easily imagine the Horns of Hammerad with every member holding one of the deadly weapons. Well—everyone except Calruz and Ceria.\n“Did we find anyone useful?”\n“Some.”\nYvlon shrugged and counted off on her gauntleted fingers.\n“A few [Mages], a Silver-rank with sword and shield…not too many, but better than nothing. I asked the mage you told me about, Gerial, but he turned me down.”\nCeria glared at Gerial while he studiously looked the other way.\n“It was, ah, just a thought. We could use all the help we can get.”\nCervial shrugged. He carefully began unstringing the black crossbow.\n“No use fretting about one or two swords now. We’re five adventuring teams. Counting the extras, we’re over forty people strong, and all of us are Silver-rank. If there’s a Gold-rank team better than this, I’d love to see it.”\nGerial nodded. He glanced covetously at the crossbow as Cervial went to store it in a case and then looked up. Both Yvlon and Ceria glanced up as well.\nThey were in the Adventurer’s Guild, sitting by themselves at a table. But someone had walked over. A Drake. He seemed…young, at least as far as they could tell. His scales were a lighter shade of blue than most, and he was smiling. At least, it looked like a smile. Just one with a lot of teeth.\n“Um. Excuse me? I heard you were the team going into the ruins. Would you mind if I joined your group?”\nThe adventurers shared a glance. Yvlon cleared her throat and smiled at the Drake.\n“I’m sorry, but we have enough fighters, and this is a dangerous expedition we’re embarking on. We can’t take rookies or people who aren’t adventurers.”\nThe Drake looked surprised.\n“How do you know I’m not an adventurer?”\n“You don’t have any weapons or armor, and you act like a civilian.”\n“Oh.”\nThe Drake nodded.\n“But I still think you might be willing to take me. I have valuable skills I could contribute, and I—I’d like to improve myself.”\n“Oh? And what class are you, then? And I don’t believe I caught your name.”\nFlustered, the Drake bowed his head slightly.\n“Forgive me, I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Olesm. I’m a [Tactician]. Level 24.”",

    "text": "Ceria and Gerial returned to the inn and paused. Instead of dinner, they saw an unusual sight. All of the Horns of Hammerad were sitting in the grass, watching as Calruz chased Erin around. He was punching and kicking at her—not as hard or quickly as they knew he could, but with enough force that Erin was screaming and running around, dodging frantically.\n“\nAaaah! Help!\n”\nErin ducked and scuttled away as Calruz swung one massive fist towards her head. He scowled at her.\n“Stop running! Don’t—don’t\ncrouch\nlike that. If you must retreat, do it quickly and without wasting motion. Never turn your back to the enemy!”\n“Calruz! What are you doing?”\nCeria ran forwards. Erin dove and hid behind her. The half-Elf barred Calruz’s way as the Minotaur tried to follow Erin.\n“Move aside, Ceria. I am teaching her to fight.”\n“By bullying her?”\n“She must learn to fight an enemy stronger and larger than she is.”\n“Yeah, but there are limits.\nI\nwouldn’t ever get in a fight with a Minotaur. If I’m ever without mana or any potions, I’ll just run for it.”\n“Exactly!”\nErin tried to keep Ceria between her and Calruz as she glared at the Minotaur.\n“I’m hungry! And tired! I’ve been doing stupid spars all day! I haven’t even had\nlunch!\n”\n“Is this true?”\nCalruz didn’t appear fazed by either female’s disapproval. He snorted and didn’t respond. Ceria crossed her arms.\n“I’m sure Erin was grateful to learn from you, but if she doesn’t want to learn any more, you have to respect that.”\nCalruz waved one hand dismissively.\n“Running away will not solve anything. She must hone her instincts. I will let her rest after she lands a proper hit on me. Now move—”\nHe pushed Ceria aside. The half-Elf growled, but Erin dashed forwards.\n“Take\nthis!\n”\nErin kicked upwards. Instantly, Calruz’s legs tried to lock together, but it was too late. Gerial, Sostrom, and every other male in the Horns of Hammerad\nwinced\nas Calruz bellowed in agony.\nFleeing backwards again, Erin stopped ten feet away and stared at Calruz.\n“How’s\nthat,\nyou jerk? Happy?”\nCeria started laughing as Calruz swore in his own language, uttering several guttural sounds as he straightened. He covered his private…part with one hand as he glared at Erin.\n“That—was a dishonorable blow.”\n“But it\nwas\nwhat you wanted. Keep chasing me and I’ll—I’ll do it again!”\nHe glared, but Erin could glare with the best, and she was tired and upset. At last, he blew out air through his nostrils, veins throbbing on his forehead.\n“Go. Rest.”\nBefore he could change his mind, Erin fled. Ceria was still laughing.\nCalruz turned to Toren and pointed.\n“I will teach you. If you are to protect her, you must fight better. Come. Strike at me.”\nThe skeleton rushed at Calruz without needing further prompting. The Horns of Hammerad began taking bets on whether he’d hit Calruz.\nToren feinted at Calruz and then tried to copy the move Erin had used. His foot came up. Calruz caught his leg and narrowed his eyes at the skeleton.\nErin had just poured herself a cup of water and come back outside in time to see Calruz hurl Toren’s head off the hill. She cleared her throat, and the Horns of Hammerad looked around.\n“If you’re done beating up my skeleton, does anyone want something to eat?”",

    "text": "“That was hilarious.”\n“It was underhanded.”\n“I’ve never seen anything funnier.”\nCeria was still chuckling as she sat with Calruz in the inn, eating pasta. It was Erin’s go-to option when she was pressed for time or tired. Boil water, insert pasta, chop up onions, add some butter and other ancillary parts and you’re done. Nothing simpler.\nCalruz was still glaring at his plate, but he’d mostly recovered from Erin’s literal low blow. He shook his head as the half-Elf kept poking fun at him.\n“At least she was able to strike at me, even by surprise. That is good.”\nCeria stopped laughing and grew serious for a moment.\n“But really, Calruz, why were you so intent on teaching her? I thought you were going to just show her how to punch properly, not try and turn her into an adventurer overnight.”\nThe Minotaur grunted and forked a huge mess of noodles and sauce into his mouth.\n“I was. But she showed me that she had more potential than that.”\n“Oh?”\nHe grunted.\n“She is—talented. Very talented. Ceria. In the course of a few hours, she was able to overwhelm that skeleton in a fist fight. And then she unlocked a Skill. She learned one in the heat of training.”\nCeria had been drinking blue juice. She choked on her drink, and Calruz had to tap her on the back before she got her breath back.\n“You’re joking.”\n“No.”\n“That’s\nimpossible.\n”\n“It is rare, but I have heard of it being done. Never seen it on one’s first day of training. Erin Solstice has a sense for battle. I have met others like her. She is gifted. Talented. It is a shame she never trained before this.”\n“Stop. My ears are burning.”\nErin smiled at Calruz as she brought another plate of steaming sausages out for the two at their table. The Minotaur and Ceria both made sounds of appreciation, but he stopped Erin as she was about to go back into the kitchen.\n“You have potential. But if you are attacked now, what I have taught you will not suffice. You must practice. Train. Remember that for now you are still weak.”\n“Oh, I know. I’m not going to do anything stupid, even if I do learn to fight, though. Anyways, if I ever do get attacked, I’ll just toss a jar of acid at them.”\nCeria paused as she reached for the largest sausage on the plate.\n“What?”\nErin carefully brought out one of the small jars she’d made for the Goblins and showed it to Calruz and Ceria, explaining where she got it from. In the meantime, Ceria scooted her chair as far away from the glowing green liquid as she could.\n“Do you—do you have no sense of danger? Why are you so\ncasual\nwith that stuff? What if you dropped it?”\n“Hey,\nI’m\nnot the one handling it! Toren doesn’t have any fleshy bits to melt, and it’s useful.”\nCeria shook her head.\n“You Human—no, you’re crazy. Pardon me, Erin, but you are.”\nGerial leaned across the table and studied the jar of acid. He looked up at Erin.\n“May I buy one?”\n“You? Are you\ninsane\n, Gerial?”\n“It may come in useful, Ceria. Besides, it shouldn’t break if I put it in my pack.”\n“It’s your funeral. Just don’t walk near me while we’re fighting.”\nErin nodded happily and took the silver coins from Gerial.\n“I’ve got lots more if you want some.”\nGerial hesitated. He eyed the jar of acid and shook his head.\n“One is fine. It may be quite useful, but I’ll trust to my usual preparations rather than rely on it.”\n“Speaking of which…”\nCeria cleared her throat and nodded to the other Horns of Hammerad. They gathered around, and the half-Elf pointed to a big pack she and Gerial had carried from the city.\n“It’s time. Yvlon bought supplies, but I’ll hand them out now so you can put them in your packs. We’ve got rations and water and four healing potions and four mana potions each. Torches and flint—all the basic supplies, but we’ll have a few carts we’ll take in with us.”\nErin was curious.\n“Only four healing potions? Wouldn’t it be better to, I dunno, take a lot? That way you can just heal up again and again, right?”\nThe adventurers laughed, but not condescendingly. Ceria shook her head and smiled as she explained.\n“There’s a limit to how much we can heal. After so many potions the body just—quits. And besides, if we’re taking enough injuries to need more than a few healing potions, we’re already in trouble.”\nGerial nodded as he handed out bulky packages of dried rations and water flasks around.\n“The longest battle we’ve had was against an undead Lich a while back. We ran out of potions, and half of our group could barely move from healing up. We can’t rely on magic for everything.”\n“Just everything important.”\nCeria muttered under her breath and smiled at Gerial when he glared at her. Calruz cleared his throat, and all the people in the room quieted.\n“I am not one for speeches. But tomorrow we go into new ruins, and we may find treasure beyond our dreams there or the greatest of enemies. Regardless, we go together. The Horns of Hammerad shall return triumphant.”\nHe raised his mug.\n“To honor and glory.”\n“To honor.”\nThe Horns of Hammerad clinked glasses. Erin watched, silently, as they drained their mugs in a single go. She was impressed. Even Ceria managed to do it. You wouldn’t expect such a petite form to be able to hold so much liquor—especially when she repeated the trick.\n“Can you really handle drinking so much?”\nCeria grinned and shrugged.\n“This isn’t that strong. And besides, we’re heading in later in the morning. If I get really drunk, I’ll get someone to heal me. Or drink a mana potion.”\nErin looked confused. Ceria explained.\n“Mana potions and alcohol don’t mix well. I drink it, everything comes back up. It’s messy, but effective.”\nSomehow, the idea of a graceful half-Elf puking like a college student after a night of hard drinking offended Erin more than anything else.\n“Just so long as you don’t forget and drink the acid.”\nCeria shuddered, and Gerial shook his head.\n“No worries. I’ve got that securely put away.”\nThey went to bed early. That surprised Erin.\nShe\nwouldn’t have been able to sleep a wink, but maybe it was the alcohol that did it.\nThe Horns of Hammerad trooped upstairs. Erin remained in the common room. She wasn’t tired yet. Well, she was, but there was still some part of her that was awake.\nShe sat in the empty room, watching Toren move around collecting mugs and sweeping up dust. Vaguely, Erin rubbed at the knuckles of her right hand. It still hurt.\nShe stared at her hand. It was just a hand. She’d moved chess pieces with it for so long her fingers were callused. But now she stared at her knuckles. She’d never hit anything before in her life. But today she’d won a fight.\nErin closed her fingers into a fist and then sighed. She shook her head.\n“…What a crappy thing to be good at.”\n[Skill – Power Strike learned!]\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "On the day of the expedition, all the members of the Horns of Hammerad woke and trooped downstairs to breakfast in silence. Erin, the cheerful [Innkeeper], had provided breakfast—eggs and bacon.\nIt was the second day in a row she’d provided the same kind of breakfast—but most of them didn’t care. It was nice, hot food, and the [Innkeeper] had put more time and coin into the food than another inn, which might serve you cheap porridge instead.\nCeria sat at one of the tables, blinking and poking at the wobbling, yellow yolk of one of her poached eggs. She was still sleepy, but the blue juice woke her up in a pleasant way.\nShe looked up from her food and glanced around the room. Good. Everyone was present. All ten members of the Horns of Hammerad were sitting, eating or talking quietly. Calruz and Gerial sat together, discussing the plan, no doubt. Sostrom and another member of the party, Marian, sat at the same table, talking, while the five warriors sat at another table and ate silently.\nAside from those two and Hunt, Ceria didn’t know the rest of her team intimately. They were colleagues and friends, of course, but she’d only fought with them for less than a year—in the case of their most junior members, only a month. Big teams rotated adventurers in and out. Gerial was a heart of the team, like Calruz, but some might not last.\nSostrom laughed at something Marian had said. He liked her. She was the only person who didn’t make fun of his bald spot on occasion. Ceria still hadn’t figured out if he and Marian were sleeping together.\nIf they were, she hoped Marian wouldn’t break his heart when she left. Sostrom was a good mage, a solid Level 16 [Elementalist]—ordinary in both class choice and spell selection. Marian was a low-level [Ranger], but she pulled her weight.\nIt was just—\nShe wasn’t a true adventurer, a true member of the Horns of Hammerad. Ceria still respected her, but Marian only wanted to earn enough money to start a store or an inn herself. Adventuring was a job for her.\nIt was a job for Ceria, of course, but it was also her\nlife.\nShe lived to adventure. By earning gold, she could master new spells, and with the rare magical items she looted, she could continue to improve herself as a mage and level. She wouldn’t stop adventuring even if she found a thousand gold pieces lying around. She’d just buy a new spell book or a wand and continue on.\nCeria was a lifer, although she didn’t know that term. She, Gerial, Calruz, Sostrom, and Hunt were all adventurers who would never quit. Even before they’d joined together to form the Horns of Hammerad two years ago, each one of them had spent years working their way up the ranks to get where they were.\nSomeday, Marian would quit. And they would find someone else to fill her place. Perhaps right after the expedition. If she didn’t die.\nThat was a dark thought, and not one she should be having. Ceria shook her head and concentrated on her meal. She broke the yolk on her egg and watched it soak into the slice of toasted bread. How delicious.\nShe loved eggs. She loved climbing into trees and stealing them out of nests. Humans tended to disapprove of that in general, but Ceria had grown up part of her life foraging off the land. She wasn’t picky about where her food came from.\nShe’d eaten earthworms, beetles, bark off of trees—which wasn’t good for your bowels or health—birds both raw and cooked, and occasionally, mushrooms and roots and such. She’d come close to starvation so many times she had developed an appetite for unusual things. Like bugs, although Ceria didn’t like having to pick them out of her teeth afterwards. But they\nwere\nfun to eat.\nMm. She wondered what those Acid Flies Erin sold tasted like…",

    "text": "“Mm. We’re all set. Time to head out?”\nGerial took a drink of the sweet blue juice before replying to Calruz.\n“We’ve got an hour yet. Plenty of time. Let’s not rush things.”\nThe Minotaur nodded silently and gestured at Toren for another plate of bacon. Gerial wondered how he could eat so much.\nHis\nstomach wasn’t letting him eat more than a bit of breakfast. He was so energized with nerves as much as anticipation he felt like getting up to pace around.\nBut, of course, he couldn’t. The vice-Captain of the Horns of Hammerad had to project calm, and that was what Gerial was going to do. He took his job seriously. He had to be a leader like Calruz.\nAnd Ceria, for that matter. Gerial spotted her sitting at her table, looking pensively down into her plate of food. She didn’t seem the slightest bit nervous. He envied her that.\nThe half-Elf’s gaze had turned far-off, and her expression had become distant. Gerial was familiar with that look. Another thing to envy.\nHe felt he would never understand the true complexities and unearthly thoughts that surely ran through her mind. She might appear Human in many ways, but Ceria was half Elf. Half of her was descended from legends, and who knew what deep thoughts she pondered at times like these?\n“Hey there!”\nGerial jumped and quickly looked away from Ceria. He smiled up at Erin and smoothed his mustache. Now here was someone he could understand. Erin Solstice was as likable and approachable as any innkeeper he had ever met. He would be sorry to say goodbye.\n“Ah. Miss Erin. I hope you are recovering from your cold? We were intending to leave payment and go without bothering you, but you were up before we were.”\nErin looked startled.\n“What? Oh, no, I couldn’t do that. I’m feeling a lot better. And you guys paid me so well—a big breakfast is the least I could do. You’re, uh, heading into the ruins today, aren’t you?”\nCalruz grunted, and Gerial nodded.\n“Indeed we are. We and four other adventuring teams are going in.”\n“Wasn’t it six teams total?”\nGerial winced and glanced at Calruz surreptitiously.\n“The last adventuring Captain, ah, pulled out at the last moment.”\n“Hendric. Coward.”\nCalruz rumbled darkly. Gerial hoped he wouldn’t start shouting. That would be the last thing they needed right before the expedition.\nTo his relief, Erin didn’t seem off-put by the Minotaur’s ire. She poked Calruz in the side, causing the Minotaur to glare at her while Gerial choked on his food.\n“Cheer up, grumpy. I’m sure you’ll be fine.”\nShe glanced at Gerial.\n“So—should I expect you guys to come back tomorrow? Or tonight…? How long is this, uh, dungeon exploration going to take?”\n“We’re not sure. I wouldn’t count on our return, but it could happen.”\nGerial shrugged uncomfortably, not liking the uncertainty in his own voice.\n“We have enough supplies for at least four days. I doubt we’ll be down there that long unless we need to do excavation, though.”\nAcross the room, Hunt looked up from his meal. He had egg in his beard, which Gerial didn’t comment on.\n“Those ruins could be deep, though. No telling how far down they go.”\n“We’re not clearing out every room. As soon as we strike a treasury or find enough to justify the costs, we’ll leave.”\n“Hah! Tell that to the other teams. Gregor is saying his team won’t quit until they reach the bottom floor. A big change from what he was saying earlier.”\n“Well, if we’re going in, we might as well go all in.”\n“Speaking of which…Gerial, is it time?”\nCeria glanced meaningfully at the sky through a window. Gerial nodded.\n“I suppose we should be going. The meeting is about an hour’s time away, and we don’t want to be late. Is everyone finished?”\nThey were. Or they were once he spoke. The strange skeleton walked around the room collecting dishes while Erin saw the Horns of Hammerad off.\n“Good luck. Don’t get, uh, killed by a Dragon or anything.”\nGerial and the others had to laugh at that.\n“There are no Dragons on this side of the world, miss. Probably anywhere.”\n“Um. There are. I’ve seen one.”\nTheir laughter stopped abruptly. Gerial stared into Erin’s honest expression. He opened his mouth to say something—\n“Hello?\nHello!\nI’m sorry I’m late!”\nA figure dashed up the hill. The pale-blue Drake wearing leather armor was desperately trying to buckle his sheathed sword to his belt as he stopped before the Horns of Hammerad.\n“I’m not late, am I? I forgot we were supposed to meet here.”\n“Olesm?”\nErin stared incredulously at the Drake.\n“What are you—\nyou’re\ngoing on the expedition too? But you’re not an adventurer!”\nOlesm, the [Tactician] they’d hired on yesterday, widened his eyes, and his tail began twitching as he noticed Erin.\n“Oh, Erin. I didn’t—well of course you’d be here. This is your inn—yes, I am going on the expedition! I’m hoping to raise my level. I was so inspired by you that I decided it was time to break out of my shell, so to speak.”\n“But can you defend yourself? I mean, I don’t want to be rude but…”\nThe way Erin looked at Olesm spoke very plainly of her opinion of his fighting prowess. The Drake blushed, but stuck out his chest.\n“I may not be a good fighter, but my Skills should help quite a bit. Believe me, I will come back better than ever. And perhaps then I’ll win a game against you.”\n“But it’s\nchess\n. That’s not the same as—as fighting. And wait a second, Selys said you work for the city. Aren’t you supposed to, like, be there?”\nErin waved at Liscor in the distance. Olesm avoided everyone’s gaze and coughed into one first.\n“Technically, yes. But they won’t miss me for a few days. The Watch is supposed to work with me, and I advise the Council, but they meet once a month if that. They don’t need me here. The army has a dozen people who could take my post over in a second. And besides. I’ve stayed the same level for far too long, hiding in the city rather than joining the army or adventuring myself. Today, I’m going to change that.”\n“Enough talk.”\nCalruz growled, making Olesm jump and stammer. He pointed.\n“We have to go. Follow us, but don’t lag behind.”\n“Oh, of course. My apologies.”\nOlesm sidled behind the Minotaur and smiled toothily at Gerial. The man tried to smile back, unsure of whether he should bare his own teeth.\nErin was talking to Ceria while she tried to offer the Horns of Hammerad a basket of food to take with them.\n“I’ll be happy to serve you if you guys come back tonight, no matter how late. Just knock, okay? I’ve got guests coming anyways.”\n“Oh? Who?”\n“We’re\ngoing.\n”\nCalruz poked Ceria in the back, making her stumble. She turned and kicked at the Minotaur, but it was time to go. Gerial bade farewell to Erin as the Horns of Hammerad descended the hill.\nThey saw Erin’s guests about fifteen minutes after they’d begun walking. Five Antinium were making their way from the city. Two of them were carrying one Gerial recognized. His stomach still clenched to see Pawn’s mangled limbs, but the Antinium greeted them without any inflection of pain in his voice.\n“Greetings, adventurers. Olesm.”\n“Oh? Pawn! Are you going to play chess at Miss Erin’s?”\nOlesm greeted the Antinium cheerfully as the other adventurers mumbled awkward greetings. Pawn nodded at him.\n“Yes. We do not have any duties, so we go to play.”\n“Oh? I thought you always worked in the morning. Is something wrong?”\n“Nothing is wrong. We have no tasks because we are waiting.”\n“Waiting? Waiting for what?”\nCalruz growled and started walking again. Olesm followed, but Pawn and the other Antinium simply followed their group, continuing the conversation.\n“We wait for the Queen.”\n“The Queen? Is she…is she doing something?”\n“Yes. She is close to completing her task.”\n“I heard about that. She didn’t talk to anyone and sent that new Prognugator out. Ksmvr, right? What was she doing that was so important.”\n“We do not know. But it will be tomorrow.”\nOlesm stared at Pawn. Gerial saw Ceria glance swiftly backwards at the Antinium.\n“What will be tomorrow?”\n“It will be. Good luck on your mission, Olesm.”\n“Oh, um, bye—”\nThe Antinium left. Calruz growled and stomped onwards, muttering about delays while Gerial pondered the conversation. What did it mean? Did it even matter? The Antinium were strange. Gerial had learned long ago how dangerous they could be and how strange they were. But Pawn didn’t seem evil. Odd, perhaps, but—\nWhatever thoughts he had, they were put out of Gerial’s mind when he saw the ruins in the distance. Even from miles away, the dark, grey and black stone of the huge structure stood out against the hill it had been excavated from.\nIt seemed as if it were some kind of ancient barrow, the grass shining orange and green near the top of the spot where the dirt ended in a kind of cliff and the stone began. The stone was embedded in the dirt, a gaping awning, an oddity in the natural landscape of this place.\nThe stone looked so old that it was impossible to date, but people had claimed it was probably enchanted—unable to be removed or broken. Yet time had worked cracks and mossy intrusion into even what had once been solid stone. So it truly did look abandoned to time.\nThe Horns of Hammerad paused. Suddenly this morning, their small concerns and, indeed, everything else in the world had ceased for them. They had been waiting patiently these last few days. They had enjoyed themselves, gotten into small trouble or out of it, but what they had really been doing behind it all was waiting.\nWaiting for this. The ruins loomed, massive, unexplored. It called to them. They were adventurers.\nThey resumed their march. Unconsciously, their pace increased. They felt it in their blood, in their bones, and the beating of their hearts.\nDanger and glory, waiting for them in the darkness below.",

    "text": "The ruins had first been discovered a month ago by a [Shepherd] tending his flock. Drakes kept sheep and other animals just like Humans, and one of them had been walking over a hill when he’d tripped over a rock.\nAfter he’d nearly broken his foot trying to kick the rock, the Drake had dug a bit of it up and realized the rock wasn’t so much a rock as part of a building half-uncovered by rains or chance erosion. And when he’d dug further with the help of his friends, they had discovered that the bit of the building was in fact an entire structure hidden in the earth.\nAnd after the Antinium had been called and days of excavations had gone by, the city had found that the hill the building had been found on wasn’t so much a hill as the entire structure itself.\nToday, the ruins sat half-uncovered against the large hill, black stone entrance gaping open in the light of the sun. Ceria, Gerial, and the other Horns of Hammerad stared up at it.\nA wall of black rock. A carved stone doorway and, in places, open windows that allowed some ventilation into the massive structure.\nFrom up close, the massive stone doors were even more imposing. Although some of the dirt that had once covered the structure had been excavated, it was clear that this—building was huge on a completely different scale than the structures in Liscor.\nThe roof had not been excavated, and nor had the lower half of the structure. Apparently, an Antinium had dug down but had gone over a hundred feet without reaching the bottom of this massive structure. The city had decided to only dig up what was necessary, so the doorway had been uncovered and the rest of the building left alone.\nThat made the sight of the black entrance poking out of the hillside covered in grass and flowers all the more odd. And disturbing. The massive doors could easily hold two creatures twice Calruz’s height, and you could push two wagons through at the same time. It dwarfed even the large group of adventurers standing in front of the entrance.\nPerhaps there had once been a fresco or decorative front of some kind, but age had worn away any details. And besides, there was really only one message the giant stone doors told. No one was meant to easily enter this place—or exit.\n“Dead gods, I saw it from far away, but up close, this is something else entirely.”\nGerial shook his head as he and Ceria stood looking up at the ruins. She nodded.\n“The Ruins of Albez seem tiny compared to this one. Well, they’re more spread out, but still.”\n“Look at that.”\nSostrom pointed to one side of the doors. Aside from the miniature village that had popped up around the ruins full of enterprising shopkeepers, adventurers, and curious watchers, another group had already occupied this space.\nAround fifteen armed warriors, mainly Drakes and a few Gnolls—sat together around an open fire, talking and eating while two of them stood watch at the doors.\nHunt growled under his breath and gripped the mace at his side as he eyed the other group.\n“\nMore\nadventurers? I thought we were the only ones entering. If they’re trying to steal a march on us—”\nOlesm shook his head before anyone else could.\n“They’re not adventurers. That’s the local Watch.”\n“The Watch? Why are they out here?”\nCeria nodded to the group of [Guards] and then pointed to another group of warriors sitting across from them. They had no fire, but they were watching the doors as well.\n“There are several Bronze-rank adventuring teams on permanent guard duty as well as several members of the Watch. Seems like this place disgorges monsters every few days. Nothing more dangerous than a mob of zombies or the local wildlife, but they’re being cautious.”\nHunt relaxed, and the other Horns of Hammerad nodded. They weren’t used to a city militia taking such an active role, but none of them were strangers to the idea of guarding a dungeon.\n“Good thing we’re going in today. Otherwise, the city’d probably put up a request to clear out this place in a month or two.”\n“It still might come to that. Unless they destroy this damn place, something’s going to make its nest here.”\n“True.”\nGerial nodded in agreement as he studied the massive building. It was certainly inconvenient to have so close to the city. It would surely attract monsters and, worse, provide a lair for them to reproduce.\nIt wasn’t as if monsters popped out of thin air. Except for the ones that did, of course. But caves, abandoned buildings, and magical sites tended to attract monsters like honey followed bees. Monsters would breed in the darkness or reanimate in the case of the dead. Sometimes, they fought each other, but often, they lived in disturbing harmony—until the unlucky adventurer intruded on their lair.\n“There’s Yvlon. Move up.”\nCalruz finally spotted the person he was looking for. He began walking towards Yvlon and her group of female adventurers wearing polished, silver metal. Gerial picked up his pace, so he arrived just as his Captain did. Calruz had no time for minor details like that, but proper courtesy was important. It was one of Gerial’s few complaints that the Minotaur so often forgot that.\nBut Yvlon was not the kind of petty person to be bothered by such things in the first place. She smiled at Gerial and Calruz as they approached, and his heart skipped a beat. She was truly beautiful. Almost as beautiful as Ryoka, but different, of course…\n“Calruz. Gerial. I’m glad your team is here on time. Everyone else has already assembled. Shall we begin?”\n“Why waste time waiting?”\nYvlon nodded. She stepped back and let Calruz precede her. Gerial called to the Horns of Hammerad, and they joined the group of adventurers waiting outside the doors.\nCeria walked with the Horns of Hammerad, merging with the main body of adventurers as she stared up at the dark doors. It was hard—even for someone who had lived as long as she had—to stand still in this crowd. And indeed, the other adventurers around her were constantly shifting, moving around with the same energy she felt.\nThere were so many! It was a crowd of adventurers like a full day at the Adventurer’s Guild, but in this case, every single one of them was Silver-rank. They let the Horns of Hammerad move next to them, calling out good naturedly and exchanging slaps on the back in the case of the warriors, polite nods and only the occasional spine-shattering slap in the case of the mages.\nAt the head of the crowd, Yvlon and Calruz joined three other Captains. Gregor, Menes, and Cervial nodded at the Minotaur and female adventurer as the crowd grew silent.\nThe blonde adventurer raised her hands for silence, but it was already present. The adventurers—and come to that, the large crowd of onlookers—waited in breathless expectation.\n“Captains, I am pleased to see you all here. May I inquire if you are all ready?”\nThey nodded. Calruz was the first to speak. The Minotaur’s rumbling voice was loud enough to be heard quite audibly even from the back of the crowd.\n“The Horns of Hammerad are all here.”\n“The Flawless Flights are ready to go.”\n“Kyrial’s Vanguard are armed and ready to fight!”\n“We of the Circle of Reneë have prepared our spells.”\n“And the Silver Spears are assembled.”\nYvlon nodded to the other adventuring Captains and raised her voice to address the crowd.\n“I’m pleased to see everyone is present. But I expected nothing less of the best adventurers on this side of the continent! We are here today to make history by entering the Ruins of Liscor. We don’t know exactly what is down there, but we do know something dangerous lurks below. And where there is danger, there is treasure and fame to be found.”\nThe adventurers shifted at that. Yvlon was speaking their language, and her gaze was open and honest. She didn’t lie about the danger, and that they appreciated.\n“Some of us may perish on this expedition. Five Families willing, it will be few or none. But I swear that each of you will receive a portion of the reward, and your families and loved ones will not be left penniless should you fall. That is the pledge I make towards each of my Silver Spears, and I offer the same to you today.”\nShe shook her head, and her golden blonde hair shook in the air, catching the light. Ceria smiled at that; Yvlon had to know exactly what she was doing and how her armor and hair shone.\n“But enough dire thoughts. We are about to head in. Steel yourselves. Trust in each other. We know what must be done. Calruz, your Horns of Hammerad and Gregor, your Kyrial’s Vanguard have been chosen to lead the expedition. Would you do the honors?”\nCalruz and Gregor nodded. They stepped towards the doorway and gestured.\n“Kyrial’s Vanguard—\nform up!\n”\n“To me, Horns of Hammerad.”\nThat was their signal. Ceria walked out of the crowd, ignoring the gazes of the other adventurers. Some of their group weren’t so graceful and stumbled or blushed, but they formed up behind Calruz as the Minotaur stood next to Gregor.\nThe massive, armored man who carried a battleaxe almost as large as Calruz’s scowled when he saw Olesm tagging along with the other adventurers.\n“Who’s the Drake? I thought we agreed not to hire anyone else, Yvlon.”\nOlesm jumped, and his scales faded in color, but Yvlon shook her head.\n“He’s a [Tactician], not a [Warrior], Gregor. A Level 24. He came to us yesterday. I thought you’d agree we could definitely use him.”\nGregor scowled, but Yvlon was right. He nodded grudgingly.\n“Hmph. Very well. Just so long as he doesn’t start giving orders to the rest of us.”\n“Oh, I wouldn’t do that. I’m just here to help.”\n“Fine.”\n“Are you done?”\nCalruz growled at Gregor. He was breathing harder, and his gaze was narrowed as he stared into the darkness of the ruins. Gregor opened his mouth to snap something back, then paused.\n“I’m done. Shall we?”\n“Yes. Let us begin.”\nThe two Silver-rank Captains shared a glance. Then, as one, they unholstered their battleaxes. It was pure showmanship—none of the adventurers expected to be attacked the instant they entered, but the crowd loved it.\nThe Bronze-Rank Adventurers and civilians cheered as Calruz and Gregor advanced into the ruins, weapons at the ready. Their vice-Captains, Gerial and a big man named Ulgrim, followed. Ceria was right behind Gerial as they stepped into the darkness. She held her glowing wand at the ready as the adventurers around her ignited torches or cast [Light] spells.\nThe darkness enveloped the adventurers even as Yvlon and the other two Captains began following their teams in. Ceria felt the air change, grow dead and stale, as the darkness closed around them. The grass and dirt became carved stone, and their footfalls echoed in the silence.\nThe adventurers readied themselves for anything. They could sense it. They had broken the sanctity of this dark place, and they would not leave until they had uncovered its every secret.\nIt had begun.",

    "text": "“You know, I would have expected something to happen by now.”\n“Oh really? You haven’t explored many dungeons, then.”\nEven in the flickering light of their torch, Ceria could see Olesm blush.\n“This is my first one, actually.”\n“Oh? Don’t freeze up and you’ll be fine. Besides, once this is done, you can tell all your friends about it. I’m sure Erin would be very impressed. Everyone loves experienced…adventurers. Especially ones who have big…swords. And explored a lot of dungeons, of course.”\nIt was quite entertaining to Ceria, seeing how red she could make Olesm’s scales. The Drake cleared his throat and quickly cast around for something else to say.\n“These rooms—are quite odd, aren’t they?”\nCeria nodded. It was fifteen minutes into their expedition, but so far, the adventurers had seen very little. They’d passed through a long entrance hall of some kind into large, open rooms with little ornamentation and a lot of dust. Their group had split up—scouts from Cervial’s team going ahead while the main force went through the various rooms, but they’d found little.\n“Broken chairs, metal—I can’t tell. It’s been too long, and everything is dust now. This was once some kind of sanctuary, perhaps? A massive one.”\n“It’s big. But I could see that. Strange, though—all these rooms must be living quarters, kitchens, storage rooms, and so on. This is practically a city within this one building. How come no one knew of this before?”\n“It must be ancient. Far older than Liscor. I can’t imagine how they built all of this—and out of stone! They must have had hundreds, thousands of workers or some kind of powerful magic.”\nCeria nodded as she stepped around a collapsed table that might have once served twenty guests at a time.\n“Another time. Another world. They knew how to build such things back then. Is this one of the Walled Cities, perhaps, only forgotten by time? Or something like Liscor?”\n“The design of the gates certainly suggests that. Of course, you need a roof or some good magic when the rainy season comes. I suppose it\ncould\nhave been built by my people.”\nOlesm looked around and shuddered. Ceria knew how he felt. She wasn’t comfortable with the dark, echoing rooms any more than he was. For all they were spacious, she felt like she was cramped, confined. She could handle it, but Olesm was nervous and chatty, and she didn’t mind talking to him.\nIt wasn’t as if the other adventurers weren’t talking. The scouts and leading adventurers were silent as they walked up ahead, but the main group of adventurers kept quiet conversations going, joking, talking idly, anything to keep the tension at bay.\n“So—I’m with your group. The, ah, Horns of Hammerad? I’m afraid I don’t know much about it. Liscor didn’t get many high-profile adventurers before this.”\nCeria raised her eyebrows.\n“High profile? Hear that, Gerial? I wish we were that famous.”\nGerial looked back and smiled wryly at Ceria. Olesm was confused.\n“But you’re Silver-rank adventurers. I just assumed—”\n“Ceria is just teasing you Mister, ah, Olesm. We are quite well known locally. It’s just that we’re hardly the only Silver-rank teams in the north. And if you count the coastal cities—well, there are a number of Gold-rank teams and adventurers up there, and we can hardly compare.”\n“Well, you seem quite competent to me. What does your group do? Aside from exploring ruins, that is.”\nGerial smiled.\n“We specialize in monster slaying. If a troublesome group of monsters is infesting a region, we’re usually one of the first groups who answer the call. The Horns of Hammerad are a close-combat group. We close in and smash the enemy while our mages provide backup. Gregor’s Pride is the same.”\n“Oh, I see, I see. And the Silver Spears?”\n“Good at defense, coordination, strategy; a solid team. The Flawless Flights on the other hand do a lot of scouting work and hunting troublesome monsters that hide.”\n“And the—the Circle? They were all [Mages]. Is that usual?”\nCeria shrugged.\n“Not usual, but not unusual either. They take on almost all requests. They’ve got a bad reputation, though.”\n“Why is that?”\nCeria grinned.\n“Because they run away quite often.”\nA [Mage] from further up ahead had heard that. He turned and flicked up a middle finger at Ceria, and she grinned and waved at him in apology. Mollified, the mage went back to his conversation.\nLowering her voice so she wouldn’t be heard, Ceria murmured to Olesm.\n“If they’re out of mana, there’s not much they can do. So yes, often Menes’ team will abandon a mission if something makes them use up all their potions or if the enemy is more numerous or stronger than they anticipated.”\n“Oh. I see.”\n“They do good work most of the time, though.”\nGerial nodded in agreement.\n“But they do have their own style. They prioritize all contracts with anything magic related. It’s their specialty, just like how Cervial has a lot of archers in his group and Yvlon’s team wears silver armor.”\n“Do the Horns of Hammerad have a, um, noticeable feature?”\n“…Not so much a feature as a code. We don’t break our promises. We don’t retreat, and if we have to abandon a job, we repay all we took in advance.”\nGerial murmured into his mustache.\n“‘Death before dishonor.’”\n“Really?”\n“It’s what we live by. Our leader is Calruz. And you know what Minotaurs are like.”\n“Oh. Of course.”\nOlesm was silent for a while longer as the adventurers trooped onwards. They reached some kind of audience chamber with a large altar at the front. Ceria pointed while the Captains called for a short break.\n“Look at that. You can tell this place is old because of the architecture. I’ve never seen any designs like it. It must be a previous era’s style.”\nYvlon nodded.\n“True. What do you make of it, Olesm? Was this place built by your people?”\nHe could only shrug helplessly.\n“It certainly seems like it. How else would you explain it being so close to Liscor?”\n“And if it was, would they have much treasure?”\nEvery adventurer in earshot stared expectantly at Olesm. He thought about it and nodded.\n“Oh, most definitely. We love collecting things. We are descended from Dragons after all. If this place was at all important, I’d expect some sort of vault.”\nThat made the other adventurers perk up, including Gerial and Ceria. It was always welcome to know their efforts might not be in vain.\nThey were about to keep moving when a loud voice cut through the hushed conversations.\n“Contact.”\nThe word made every adventurers’ head snap up. They scanned for any sign of movement, but the person who had spoken was passing a message from further ahead.\n“One of our scouts found a nest of Shield Spiders. The damn things must be infesting this place already.”\nSeveral adventurers swore, but Gregor hushed them with a slashing movement of one hand.\n“Shut it. How big’s the nest?”\n“Not big. Around eight adults and a few dozen of the bigger children that we could see. Perhaps there’s more in another room, but they’ve only webbed up one so far.”\nGregor looked at Olesm.\n“You’re the local expert. Any advice?”\nThe Drake nodded.\n“Shield Spiders are weak against fire. Two mages with armed warriors holding shields should be able to burn the nest if they know the [Fireball] spell or equivalents.”\nYvlon nodded.\n“My team can do the fighting. Menes, if you want to send some of your mages…?”\n“Done.”\nThe scout led a detachment of nine adventurers off as the others prepared to move. That was the benefit of such a large group. They could keep going even if they ran into smaller groups of monsters.\nTheir path took them onwards through rooms in a winding pattern. If the ruins had been fully excavated, they could have made much faster progress, but the diggers and adventurers who had come before them had dug randomly and created a maze within the maze. More than once, the expedition had to halt to dig out a collapsed tunnel again.\nCervial shook his head as they passed by a corridor blocked off by a wall of dirt.\n“I don’t like these unexcavated areas. Something could tunnel their way around and ambush us.”\nYvlon paused and considered the situation. Menes tapped her on the shoulder and gestured to his wand.\n“We don’t have time to block everything off. How about this? We’ll set wards that will go off if something crosses them.”\nShe looked at Calruz and Gregor. They nodded in agreement.\n“That sounds good. Do it.”\nThey left a few mages and warriors to set wards while they moved on. After about thirty minutes, they’d reached a long,\nlong\ncorridor wide enough for eight people to walk across when they heard a shout.\nThis time, they saw a woman running back towards them. She was a [Thief], and her footfalls barely made any sound despite her rapid approach. She stopped and gasped out her message, panting as more scouts ran back towards them.\n“Zombies. At least thirty of them up ahead. Probably more. They’re coming from below.”\nThis time, every adventurer drew their weapon. Olesm fumbled as he unsheathed his sword, and the Captains glanced at each other.\n“My team will take the front—”\n“Let my archers soften them up first. We can take down at least half in this open area. Save you the energy.”\n“Good. Try not to use magic just yet if we can help it. Form up!”\nCalruz turned and began ordering the Horns of Hammerad while the other Captains did the same. The adventurers somehow understood what they were meant to do and moved smoothly into position, but Olesm blinked around, confused.\n“Over here.”\nCeria tugged him into line behind the warriors, who’d formed a wall of shields and weapons staggered so that they could fall back if need be. The mages waited in the back, ready to cast if need be while Cervial took his team to the front.\nEight adventurers, including him, set arrows to a collection of bows. Several longbows and shortbows, but the Dwarven crossbow and two slings as well. Cervial held the crossbow, sighting down it calmly as he knelt with one knee raised to steady the weapon.\nHe raised a hand. The adventurers, already silent, made no sound.\n“I hear them.”\nCeria did too. And soon, every Human could hear the rapid, thudding footfalls echoing in the distance. They were faint, but growing louder.\nOlesm was shaking with nervous energy. Ceria wanted to calm him down, but she was afraid touching him would make him shout. So she waited.\nAs the sounds grew louder, she also heard faint moaning and growling in the distance. The zombies were making noise. She saw Cervial’s eyes narrow, and he swung the crossbow up.\nThe bolt discharged with a loud\nthunk,\nand two of the adventurers with longbows shot as well. Ceria couldn’t even see that far into the darkness, but Cervial nodded.\n“Got one.”\nOne of his team nodded, and the other shook his head.\n“Hit one in the leg.”\n“Chest shot. Didn’t even slow him.”\nThey reloaded as they spoke. In a few seconds, their bows flew up and they fired again. They did this twice more before the zombies came into view of the adventurers’ light.\nCorpses ran at the adventurers. Corpses given life. They were not Human any longer. They couldn’t be, with parts of them rotted so that intestines and bone poked through their dead skin. They were also dark, some green with fungi and rot, but others blue or black in death, their skin leaking bits of their liquefied innards.\nOlesm\ngulped\nas they came into view, but Cervial’s team didn’t hesitate. Every weapon moved up, and they began shooting, the slings whirling heavy stones into the eyes and faces of the zombies as the arrows cut down others.\nA bolt from the black crossbow punched through the heads of two zombies, tripping up their companions as they ran at the adventurers.\nTen zombies fell. Then twelve. Sixteen. As they were twenty feet away, Cervial surged to his feet.\n“Back!”\nHis team rushed back through the gaps in the line the warriors had left for them. Instantly, the adventurers in front closed ranks. The zombies ran at them, biting, mouths gaping obscenely wide as they lunged at the adventurers.\nCalruz was up in front next to Gregor. Ceria saw him raise his axe, but not to swing as a zombie ran at him. He just leveled the axe at the zombie and extended his arm in a jab.\nThe sharp blades of the battleaxe\nslammed\ninto the zombie’s chest, knocking it backwards. It fell back, and Calruz brought his axe down casually on its rib cage. Bone broke, and the zombie lay still.\nThe other adventurers met the undead charge in the same way. Shields rammed into the frail dead bodies, pushing them back while swords, axes, and maces clubbed them down, bashing in their skulls, severing their heads. It wasn’t even close to a fair fight. The adventurers worked in tandem, outnumbered the dead, and had Levels and Skills. The dead only had rotting bodies, and soon, not even that.\nAfter the last crawling zombie had been dispatched, Yvlon looked around.\n“Anyone hurt? Any injuries?”\nThere were none. She went to inspect the corpses along with Cervial and a few of their scouts.\n“Hm. Look at this, Yvlon.”\nCervial showed her a few of the corpses. Yvlon saw ruined Human faces, their flesh reeking from their rapid decay. She coughed, and a mage murmured a spell.\n“[Cleansing Wind].”\n“Thank you. What am I supposed to see, Cervial?”\n“This. They’re mostly Human, these zombies. And freshly dead. If they weren’t, we’d be fighting skeletons. Average zombies rot to bone in a year or less. Even sealed—they’d be all dried out, not actively rotting.”\n“More of the adventurers who first came in?”\n“Very likely. But see behind them—?”\nThe second group was odder than the first—they were both actively still in decomposition, but as she held her nose, she saw the ragged steel and leather they wore was almost as rusted and destroyed as their bodies.\n“Drakes. Badly rotted, too. But why would their armor look that old…?”\nThe Captain of the Flawless Flights bit his lip.\n“That sounds like a failing preservation spell to me. Something is keeping them from rotting. Zombies are a bit tougher than skeletons so someone wanted their flesh intact…but didn’t spell the gear. That’s why there’s a mismatch. How long does it take for good armor to get to that state? They must be\nancient.\n”\n“Or something is restoring their flesh. Wonderful. Do you think the main threat will be the undead, then?”\n“They don’t play nice with other monsters. That would be my best bet.”\nCervial grinned, his teeth illuminated in the torchlight. Then his smile faded.\n“Still, that was quite a group. Not exactly a small welcoming committee, was it?”\nYvlon shook her head.\n“For our first real encounter in here? I’d say it was light enough.”\nThe other man nodded, but he still seemed troubled.\n“Zombies can sense the living. It’s only natural they’d feel so many of us and come running.”\nHe paused.\n“Still. That was a bit too convenient and quick for my liking. Normally, I’d expect them to be spread out as they sense us and follow each other, not rush all at once like that.”\nThe armored woman paused, thinking.\n“Could be coincidence.”\n“Perhaps not.”\nShe nodded to the scouts.\n“Go wary.”\nThey nodded and disappeared up ahead, their lights rapidly fading in the blackness.\nCeria found Olesm was shaking, but not with fear after the short battle. He stared at the dead, gagging slightly until the magic wind took away the stench.\n“That was so—so\nimpressive!\nThere were so many, but you took care of them like—like—”\nThe Drake tried to snap shaking fingers. Ceria smiled.\n“\nI\nhad nothing to do with it. Good old fashioned metal did the trick here. Which is a good thing. If we had to start casting over a few undead, we’d be in trouble.”\n“Ceria!”\nThe half-Elf glanced up. Yvlon was waving her to the front next to the other Captains. She also gestured at Olesm.\nCeria approached, Olesm trailing behind her. Yvlon smiled at both.\n“Not a bad start, is it? We work well together.”\n“Still, that was a lot of undead. Should we expect more up ahead?”\n“More than likely. We were debating using your [Illumination] spell now, Ceria. What do you think?”\nCeria hesitated.",

    "text": "“I can’t use the lights to illuminate where I haven’t been. I could use it to light the way back but—I think I should wait. It’s not like we’re so far in that it’s hard to find our way back, and when I do cast it, it should be at a place we mean to hold for a longer time.”\nYvlon nodded.\n“When we make camp, then. We’ll find a spot. But we’re hours from needing rest, so we’ll hold off.”\n“Are we moving forwards now?”\n“Almost. The scouts are saying this corridor begins to slope downwards. This is the place that leads to the second floor.”\n“That’s where all the other teams disappeared.”\n“Exactly. We’re going in ready for anything.”\nGregor and Calruz were indeed bringing all of the best adventurers to the front, creating a wall of flesh and metal while the mages and adventurers carrying ranged weapons followed behind.\n“I’m sticking in the middle while Cervial’s team covers the rear. Will you walk with me, Ceria?”\n“I’d be delighted to. Olesm?”\n“Oh, I’d be honored. And they’re moving. Should we—?”\nYvlon and Ceria walked forwards and took their positions in the middle of the group. The Silver Spears spaced themselves out across the corridor, forming a second line that could hold if the front had to fall back.\nThe Human adventurer talked quietly with Ceria while Olesm lagged behind them, awkwardly chatting up Sostrom as they walked down the corridor’s increasing slope.\n“I’m glad you aren’t angry at me.”\n“Angry? Why would I be?”\nYvlon smiled ruefully.\n“I feel like I had a lot to do with the—incident involving Ryoka earlier. I truly didn’t mean to cause that much trouble.”\nCeria shrugged awkwardly.\n“That was mostly her fault.”\n“Even so. My aunt had mentioned how much she wanted to meet this Runner, and I couldn’t fathom why. I wanted to test her, but not push her over the edge.”\n“That girl is\nall\nedge. I don’t understand why Magnolia—well, there are certain things that strike me about her. But why the lady of Reinhart would spend so much effort on her is beyond me.”\n“Beyond me as well, I’m afraid. My aunt does not confide in anyone, and she has—eclectic interests. But I do hope Ryoka doesn’t do anything rash. Once you fall into my aunt’s machinations, it is hard to break free.”\nCeria was surprised. She looked at Yvlon in the flickering light and saw the adventurer smile.\n“You don’t want to capture Ryoka to gain favor with her?”\n“Let’s just say I admire her independence, if not her self-control. Besides, it’s bad if Aunt Magnolia gets everything she wants. Hold up, what’s this?”\nThe adventurers had stopped at an open room, large and filled with stone altars and the remains of wooden tables. And curiously, open stone slabs placed symmetrically around the room.\n“Strange. What kind of stone places are these? It looks like you’d put something on them, but for what? Alchemy? Look, there’s even a divot where you’d kneel, here…to do what?”\nCeria shook her head as she stared at the plinths placed around the room. They had an odd—formality to them that reminded her of a noble court. But it had no meaning to the adventurers, any of them.\n“I’ve seen the like in pictures of Drath. Maybe some kind of ultra-formal area? Wait…you’d be facing this wall. And there was something here. See? A statue?”\nShe pointed, and the adventurers shone lights at a broken pedestal. There was only dust and fragments of stone there. Yvlon bit her lip.\n“So this was maybe some kind of memorial?”\nThe half-Elf had to demure again. She went to the slabs of covered stone next.\n“No. This is—different from above. What are those open places for? They look—big. Long enough to accommodate a body.”\nYvlon was skeptical.\n“A place to sleep? They look—far too uncomfortable even if you filled them with blankets. They’re closer to legends from my family of\nVampyres.\n”\n“What?”\nThe Captain of the Silver Spears shrugged it off, mock-shivering.\n“Oh, some long-dead monster. A children’s story. House Byres has lots of old tales like that. I should tell you the one about the Silver Dragon. But no one’s sleeping in these uncomfortable boxes. Nor do I see anyone straining their back using them as storage devices. Any other ideas, Ceria?”\nCeria shrugged. And then her eyes widened.\n“I know. This is a place to put dead bodies to be cleansed before they’re buried. This isn’t a memorial. It’s a\ncrypt.\n”\nThe adventurers around her who heard that muttered, half in agreement, the other half worried. It was good and bad news. Ceria heard Gerial explaining why to Olesm behind her.\n“A crypt or a tomb is good because there’s probably treasure buried with the dead. But it usually means traps, ancient curses and hexes on the lids of tombs, and so on. Not to mention the undead.”\nYvlon raised her voice to be heard by the others.\n“It’s a good sign, though. We know there’s something valuable here. Any place with this much architecture had to be important.”\nGregor nodded. He seemed happier than Ceria ever remembered seeing him.\n“Could be powerful artifacts up ahead. Let’s keep moving.”\n“This is a good place to fall back to, though. See—there’s only two ways in, and we can use that long corridor as a killing zone with our bows if we need to.”\nCervial pointed around the room. Yvlon nodded with the other Captains.\n“If we can’t find anywhere better, we’ll camp here. But for now—let’s continue.”\nThe adventurers formed up again and moved onwards, a bit faster now that they knew what might lie ahead. A tomb, or perhaps a treasury for the dead. It made their hearts beat a little faster, their feet move a little quicker.\nCeria was just about to ask Yvlon more about Ryoka and what she had been told about the girl when someone exclaimed up ahead. She and Yvlon pushed forwards again and found a split in their path.\n“What’s this? A split in the road? Which way did the scouts go?”\nGregor growled while Calruz squatted on the ground and looked around for a sign.\n“No markings on the walls. Why didn’t they double back and warn us?”\nYvlon frowned as Cervial and Menes both pushed their way forwards.\n“That is odd. Should we send a spell to contact them? Menes, you said your group used a short-distance communication spell, right?”\nMenes nodded. He raised his glowing staff.\n“I will talk with them. One moment—hold on, what’s this?”\nThe glowing bright-blue light from his staff had illuminated something further down the corridor. Menes pointed and walked over to something on the ground while the other Captains followed him.\n“It’s quite large—a bag?”\nIt was indeed a bag, or rather, a large, bulky sack sitting on the ground. It wasn’t alone. Ceria could see a few more objects lying on the floor, although the light didn’t illuminate them.\n“Careful, Menes. It could be a trap.”\n“Hm. [Detect Magic]. Nothing.”\nCautiously, Menes poked the bag with the tip of his staff. He moved the sides a bit, and something spilled out. Menes swung the tip of his staff down, and his eyes widened.\n“Gold?\nGold?\n”\nIt was indeed gold. As the other adventurers exclaimed, Menes carefully picked up the piece of gold and stared at it.\n“It’s not money obviously. But what is it? It looks—like part of something else. A broken piece of gold from a wall or—or statue or something.”\nGregor frowned.\n“Is there more inside?”\nCautiously, an adventurer opened the bag and exclaimed in amazement.\n“More gold! And jewels! Gods, it’s a small\nfortune!\n”\nSeveral other adventurers clustered around instantly, but Cervial pushed them back. He bent and picked up a small ruby, staring hard at it.\n“This is strange.”\n“What is?”\nHe showed the gem to Yvlon and the others. Ceria could see it glowing in the light. It was clearly high-quality, but there was something off about it.\n“Look at the sides. Stone. It was attached to something. A wall perhaps, or some kind of art?”\n“You’re saying this is from some other part of the building. Looted by an adventurer…?”\n“Must be. And these other…yes, these are all bags full of loot! Abandoned. Why?”\n“Something got them. Or—scared them enough that they dropped everything and ran.”\n“But no one ever made it down to the second floor and returned.”\nThe adventurers fell silent. Ceria felt the slight pricking of unease in her stomach.\nStrangely, it was Olesm who spoke in the silence. He looked around in the darkness, eyes flicking around him.\n“Those scouts. They never reported the split in the tunnel. And they would have come back. Where did they go?”\nYvlon opened her mouth, and then her eyes widened. A third of the adventurers in the room jerked or grabbed at their weapons. Ceria had felt it too.\nCeria and Yvlon exchanged a look.\n“My [Dangersense]—”\n“\nAmbush!\n”\nThat was the only warning they had. Something\nshrieked\noff in the distance, and the dead poured out of the walls.\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "The dead charged out of the darkness in an unending tide of desiccated corpses. Their ruined flesh and glowing eyes in hollow sockets flickered in the torch and magelight. Zombies ran, crawled, or shuffled in a wave of discolored skin, but they weren’t alone.\nMore undead had appeared: skeletons that sprang at the nearest adventurers with inhuman grace and Ghouls—the advanced form of a zombie, which moved and fought with supernatural speed and strength. And far worse, in between the lesser varieties of the dead, larger shapes and pale figures could be spotted.\n“\nCrypt Lord!\n”\n“Not just one! Four of them!”\n“We’re surrounded!\nRetreat!\n”\n“Hold your ground!”\nCalruz’s massive voice rose above the others. He cleaved a running zombie in two as he shouted at the adventurers.\n“Hold, damn you! Fall back in order! Warriors, hold, and mages retreat to the chamber!”\nIt was impossible to tell if anyone had heard. The undead were coming from all sides, not just the two passageways but from behind the adventurers as well.\nYvlon and Ceria stood side by side, eyes darting left and right. The undead were\neverywhere.\nThey were already attacking the adventurers around Ceria and Yvlon, and only their position in the middle of the group had given them a chance to react.\nCeria raised her wand, but there were too many bodies in the way from where she was. Yvlon was in the same situation. The blonde adventurer looked behind her. The adventurers were trying to move back, but a group of the dead had appeared behind them, holding them in place.\n“Where are they coming from?”\nCeria pointed.\n“There! Secret passages!”\nParts of the stone wall had opened up to let the undead come pouring out. They were only small alcoves, barely large enough for a small group to stand comfortably. But the dead had been packed inside, waiting until someone stepped in their trap.\nAnd now the trap was sprung, and death was all around.\nThe warriors in front of Ceria were grappling with the undead, but they were hemmed in and had trouble lifting their weapons. Yvlon stepped backwards and slashed at a skeleton that was stabbing a mage. The woman collapsed, bleeding, but disappeared under the press of legs before Ceria could grab her.\nDesperately, Ceria shifted to line up a spell, but she was trapped. They were too close together. She looked at the back of a warrior in chainmail and raised her wand. She could help him with a spell—\nA huge, clawed hand seized the warrior around the waist and dragged him screaming up into the air. Ceria froze as the undead monster who had seized the armored man hurled him into the press of the dead where he was instantly swarmed and torn apart.\nThe other adventurers around Ceria fell back rather than get into range of the thing’s claws. She tried to retreat, but now the press worked against her. She was suddenly at the front, and a monster was in front of her. It was no zombie. She knew she was staring at a Crypt Lord, one of the thinking undead.\nA Crypt Lord was a dead creature animated by powerful magic that had grown even more terrible over the years since its reanimation. Whatever shape they originally had, it had been twisted by rot and decay. They stood taller than every adventurer save for Calruz, their hunched backs and huge, bloated faces grinning with more sharp teeth than a Human could have.\nThey weren’t teeth, but bones. Yellowed bones that had been shifted and broken to create the illusion of a mouth in their bloated hollows of skin. They had no real organs or need to imitate the living’s biology. This was just—mockery. A paradoxical grin of rotten flesh and tangled bones.\nThe Crypt Lords ate the dead to recover their bodies. That was why their powerful arms and legs had a terrible patchwork appearance as the flesh and bone had fused to become whole.\nThe Crypt Lord grinned at Ceria, and black liquid ran from between its teeth. They had blood, of a kind. Poisonous black blood that carried disease and death.\nIt spat, and Ceria dove at once. The black poison struck her, but most of it landed on her robes, and the magic shrugged the liquid off. She rolled to a safe patch and saw two glowing blue eyes peering at her from above.\nFor a second, Ceria relaxed. It was just Toren. But—this skeleton wasn’t the same. It was covered with red blood and held a jagged, broken sword in its hands. And Toren was miles away and above ground.\nThe bloody skeleton raised the blade and brought it down on Ceria as she tried to roll again. It struck her in the back.\nCeria shouted in agony, but again, her enchanted robes caught the blade and took most of the blow. She still felt like something was trying to crush her spine, but she was alive. Not for long, though. The skeleton raised its sword again.\nCeria pointed her wand up. A shard of ice blasted the skeleton’s head off, and the rest of the body crumpled to the floor.\nShaking, she leapt to her feet. She was exposed. The Crypt Lord spat again, but this time at another adventurer. It was too dangerous. She raised her wand and aimed.\nThe monster had an amalgamation of eyes it had stolen from corpses. They clustered together in huge, fleshy sockets, around fifteen individual eyeballs in each ‘eye’. They spun towards her, and she spoke.\n“[Ice Spike]!”\nThe thick shard of ice buried itself in the Crypt Lord’s head, and a gout of black blood spurted outwards with the ruined eyeballs. The Crypt Lord roared soundlessly and ran towards Ceria.\n“Duck!”\nCeria didn’t know where the voice came from, but she instantly crouched. She felt her hair catch on something, and several strands were yanked out as Cervial loosed a crossbow bolt straight into the Crypt Lord’s other eye.\nThis time, it did scream out loud, a wailing cry that came from multiple voices within it. Ceria staggered back as it began to flail around, striking the other undead around it as it searched for something to kill.\nCeria turned, but suddenly, five zombies appeared out of the melee and ran at her and the archer-Captain. He cursed and pulled out a shortsword rather than reload. Ceria took one down with another [Ice Spike] before two of them lunged at her.\nCeria knew over fifty spells she could use, but her wand had contained the [Ice Spike] spell and thus she could cast it faster than anything else. And she had trained with the spell until she had a [Marksman]’s precision. She hammered a shard of ice into the chest of one zombie, making it sit down hard, and then fled from the other one’s hands.\nThe undead Drake lurched after her, but a woman with a mace bashed it to the ground. She was one of Yvlon’s Silver Spears, although her silvery armor was covered in gore.\nCeria didn’t bother to even shout thanks. In the next moment, both she and the warrior were fighting again. She fired over the head of an archer and caught a Ghoul as it leapt down on the man. He looked up, backed away, and then shot the creature three times in the face.\nMore movement. Ceria spun and saw a downed figure she recognized.\nA Ghoul was crouching on top of Gerial, slashing at him with its claws. Ceria didn’t hesitate. She ran forwards, drawing her belt dagger from its sheath. She planted it in the back of the Ghouls’ head, ramming it through the softened skull and into the exposed brain.\nTo her horror, the Ghoul didn’t die from her attack. It turned its head; glowing crimson eyes flashed with hatred at her. It raised a claw, and Gerial kicked up. The Ghoul tumbled off him, and he sat up and ran his sword through its shoulder.\nCeria raised her wand and blasted the creature’s face apart. It went down for good, and she helped Gerial to his feet. His face was a bloody mask, but he grabbed a potion from his belt and emptied it over his injuries. They began healing even as Ceria watched.\nHe gasped and shuddered as Ceria covered them with her wand.\n“Dead gods, this is a mess. Where are the others?”\n“I don’t know.”\nMost of the torches had been dropped on the ground, and only a few [Light] spells were illuminating the darkness. It made everything twice as hard as adventurers mistook each other for enemies.\n“Gerial. We can’t regroup like this. I need to cast [Illumination], but I’ll need defending.”\nHe nodded.\n“Do it.”\nCeria raised her wand and began focusing on the spell. It was so difficult as adventurers fought and monsters screamed around her, but she had to. Her mind was focused on a single point, and then that single point became many. She held the image of what she wanted in her head and willed it to be certainty.\n“\nForm on me!\nHorns of Hammerad, to\nme!\n”\nGerial shouted as he struck and kicked undead around them, trying to keep them from reaching Ceria. The magic in her surged. She was in a half-place, half in this world, watching, fearing, trying desperately to cast a little faster to save her friends, half in the world of magic, riding the eddies and currents and seeking the truth.\nMotion. She saw a Drake—the only one that wasn’t dead in this place—running away. A break in the dead coming from behind had created an opening, and he ran through it, fleeing the battle.\nPart of her wanted to shout, but the magic was nearly ready. Olesm was running in the other direction faster than Ceria thought he could move. Eight other adventurers fled with him, all of them mages to judge by their clothing.\nA group of skeletons was in hot pursuit. They disappeared into the darkness, and Ceria prayed she wouldn’t be too late. The magic reached a tipping point, and she opened her mouth.\n“\n[Illumination]!\n”\nLight suddenly filled the long corridor. Adventurers cried out, shielding their faces as orbs of light flew up from the ground, bright, shining, white beacons spaced ten feet apart. They turned the darkness of the crypt into day.\nFor a second, the undead faltered with the living. They hesitated, perhaps as the Crypt Lords sensed their advantage was gone. The adventurers shook the temporary blindness from their eyes. Now they could\nsee\nthe enemy. They roared and attacked.\nGerial crashed into two skeletons, scattering their bones. Ceria raised her wand and used another spell.\nA small wave of water struck Gerial behind the knees. He staggered, but his heavy armor kept him upright. The skeletons weren’t so lucky. They fell to the ground and immediately began pushing themselves upright.\nThat wasn’t her main goal, though. Ceria aimed her wand at the spreading pool of water, and it froze. Gerial cursed as the water turned to ice; he was suddenly surrounded by a huge area of iced ground. Adventurers jumped out of the way rather than fight on the unstable footing, but the dead were less intelligent. They slipped and fell as they came after them, easy targets.\nMore zombies rushed at Ceria, and she ran back. The adventurers had formed a rough circle, and she found another mage throwing bolts of fire off of his staff. He whirled and smiled at her.\n“Ceria!”\n“Sostrom!”\n“You take that side, I’ll take this.”\nThey stood back-to-back, blasting corpses back with their magic. Ceria spotted Calruz and several other warriors fighting the Crypt Lords, keeping the four massive creatures at bay while the lesser undead tried to break through the ranks of adventurers.\n“We need more space!”\nSostrom yelled it in Ceria’s ears. She nodded.\n“There! Get to Menes!”\nThe two mages ran back, letting other warriors close the gap. The mage-Captain was hurling lightning with his staff at a Crypt Lord. Ceria grabbed him by the shoulder, and he spun.\n“We need to cut them off! Can you cast a spell?”\nMenes shouted back.\n“I can! But I need an opening! And the dead are behind us as well!”\n“No!”\nSostrom pointed as Ceria and Menes jerked around to look at him.\n“Look!”\nAnother hole had opened up behind the embattled adventurers. Flashes of light and spells blasted apart zombies and skeletons. More adventurers, fighting in the burial room they’d passed. Ceria grabbed Menes’ arm and screamed in his ear.\n“There’s our opening! If you can buy us time—”\n“Give me a minute. Can you clear the area first?”\nCeria nodded.\n“Sostrom—”\n“On it.”\nHe covered both mages as they began to concentrate again. Ceria raised her wand and felt the heat building in it. She aimed and shouted at the adventurers in front of her.\n“I’m going to cast a big one. Everyone get back!”\nThey looked around, saw the fiery glow coming from her wand, and scattered to the left and right. Ceria saw Gerial ram into Calruz to get the Minotaur to move aside. She aimed at one of the Crypt Lords as it swiped at the retreating adventurers.\n“[Fireball]!”\nA glowing orange orb of fire three feet in diameter burst from her wand. It shot down the corridor and struck the Crypt Lord in the chest.\nCeria felt the blast kick her backwards and heard only ringing. Sostrom caught her, and for a few seconds, all was smoke and confusion. Then Ceria saw the Crypt Lord howling, caught ablaze, and the dead around it scattered, literally in fiery pieces or thrown to the ground.\nShe shouted at the mage next to her.\n“Now, Menes!”\nHis face was covered in sweat. Menes raised his staff and pointed at the open space as the undead tried to gather for another charge.\n“[Wall of Flames].”\nFire burst from his staff and shot past the adventurers, some of whom were unlucky enough to be scorched by the magical flames. A curtain of fire blocked off the corridor, each flame reaching nearly to the ceiling. The adventurers in front fell back as the undead entered the flames and retreated, burning and screaming.\n“Now—everyone, to the rear!”\nYvlon’s voice rose, and the adventurers turned. Some of the undead had been caught past the fire. They were hacked to pieces, and the group ran back to the large room. Calruz’s voice followed hers.\n“The spell is about to run out! Mages, buy us some time.”\nMenes nodded. He raised his staff, and two more mages joined him. They pointed at the single entrance to the room, and walls of light and magical runes appeared on the floor, blocking entry.\n“[Ward of Safety].”\n“[Lesser Barrier].”\n“[Sanctuary of Light].”\nNone of them were particularly high-level spells, all being Tier 1 and Tier 2, but together they did what an individual spell would not.\nCeria saw the wall of flames spell Menes had cast die out, and then the undead ran at the barrier. They crashed against the spells, and though they struck and hit the magical walls, they were unable to break through.\nThe adventurers watched, tense, until the undead began to pull back. The four Crypt Lords stared silently at the magic and then began walking back into the darkness. The undead followed silently. In a matter of minutes, they were gone.\nThe battle was over. And just as if another spell had been cast, suddenly Ceria could hear the other noises around her. Men and women crying out in pain, the voices, the scraping of metal and splashing as people poured potions over wounds or took off armor to get at injuries—all the noises that had been covered by the pounding of her heart.\n“Screw me with a Wyvern’s tooth, what the hell was\nthat?\n”\nGregor was shouting in the center of the milling adventurers. He was holding a piece of cloth to stop the bleeding as a healing potion regenerated a huge bite that had been taken out of one of his legs. He pointed to the corridor filled with corpses.\n“They tore us apart out there! That was an ambush! A damn ambush from the\nundead!\nHas anyone heard of such a thing?”\n“How many people are injured? Who’s missing?”\nYvlon strode around the room, listening as adventurers called out. Ceria looked around for her group and ran to the Horns of Hammerad. Miraculously, they were all there. Marian, Gerial, Calruz, Sostrom—\n“Hunt? Where’s Hunt?”\nCeria looked around in sudden panic.\n“Here. He’s here, Ceria.”\nOne of the other warriors, Barr, pointed to the ground. Ceria saw Hunt was lying with his head propped up against a pack, his face twisted into a grimace, hands frozen in a clawed position.\n“What—”",

    "text": "“A Wight got him from behind. It raked him with those damn paralyzing claws, and he froze up. He’s okay—but the magic isn’t going away for a while.”\nCeria sighed in relief. It wasn’t good—Hunt was out of commission—but he wasn’t dead. She looked at the other adventurers. They were all battered, including herself. Even with healing potions, they all had some injuries. Except for Calruz. The Minotaur looked like he’d barely taken a scratch in the fight, and only the gore painting every inch of his battleaxe testified to his involvement.\n“Ceria. It is good you are well. The lighting spell was well-timed, as was the fireball.”\nHe nodded at her as he scanned the room. She opened her mouth for a scathing retort and then closed it.\n“Yeah. I’m glad everyone’s here. How many people didn’t make it?”\nThe answer was six, which was nothing short of a miracle. But it was really only six dead and many more wounded. Most of the injuries the adventurers had taken could be cured with healing potions, but several had lost fingers or limbs, and some had broken bones in ways that couldn’t be healed with a mere potion.\nThe hardest-hit group had been Cervial’s Flawless Flights. They’d lost two in the ambush, and two more in the scouting group. He was weeping as he reloaded his crossbow with another bolt.\n“I fired it right at the damn monster, but it just took Elise and ate her. Damn it.\nDamn them.\n”\n“That was a disaster.”\nMenes agreed as he rested on a stone slab. His face was grey, a sign he’d used too much magic. Ceria felt the same way, although the mana potion she’d taken was helping.\n“How did they sneak up on us like that? We let our guards down, thinking the undead couldn’t.”\n“They were being led by Crypt Lords, that’s how. Those bastards can command the other dead.”\n“Crypt Lords. I’ve never fought their kind. Those giant things at the back—they can\nthink?\n”\nMenes and Ceria nodded.\n“How dangerous are they?”\n“A Crypt Lord is a threat capable of wiping out a Silver-rank team if they’re not careful. Recommended level to combat them is…around 22. Possibly 26 if you factor in their special abilities. They’re mostly dangerous because they can command the dead around them to do things like lie in wait or use pincer attacks.”\nGregor swore.\n“Gods. No wonder Charlez and his team didn’t make it out. We very nearly didn’t either.”\n“Good job on that [Illumination] spell, Ceria. Without it, we would have been cooked.”\nCeria bowed her head as Yvlon nodded at her. Cervial nodded dully, and Gregor grunted.\n“Yes, and the [Mages] certainly saved us. But there’s a problem. Where’s that damned lizard?”\n“W-who? Me?”\nGregor scowled across the room at Olesm. The Drake flinched as he stormed towards him.\n“You! I saw you running away! I should run you through myself, you coward!”\nOlesm raised his hands as Gregor’s fists tightened.\n“Please, allow me to explain—”\n“Hold it, Gregor!”\nAnother mage sitting with his back to a wall raised his hand wearily as Gregor’s face reddened. He pointed at Olesm.\n“That Drake didn’t run. He\nsaved\nus. And you as well. When the undead were running at us, he got a group of us mages and used a Skill to let us escape the ambush. That let us get back here and open a path for the rest of you.”\n“What?”\nGregor stared incredulously at Olesm. The Drake grinned nervously at him.\n“[Rapid Retreat]. It’s, ah, a [Tactician] skill, although many [Thieves] and similar classes know it too. I heard Calruz shouting to get back over here, and I thought the rest of you would be right behind me.”\nThe adventurers murmured in appreciation. Gregor hesitated and then nodded slowly.\n“Well. Good job. My apologies. Thank you for doing that. If you hadn’t—”\n“It was a terrible ambush. My [Dangersense] only went off at the last moment. If we’d paid more attention to the scouts—”\n“They were our best. Nothing should have been able to take out all of them without making a sound. Not even a horde of the undead. All of them had escape skills. So how—”\nYvlon rested a hand on Cervial’s shoulder comfortingly. She looked around at the other adventurers.\n“We can worry about that after the threat is gone. Those spells won’t last forever. And we need a fast decision. Do we press on, now we know how many undead are out there, including Crypt Lords? Or do we retreat?”\n“Retreat?”\nEven Cervial raised his head at that word. He shook his head, dark fury in his eyes.\n“No. We don’t do that. That was an ambush, not a fair fight. We’re going to go after those monsters and shoot them to bits.”\n“Any idea on how?”\nThat came from Gerial. He stood at the barrier and stared out into the darkness. Ceria’s [Illumination] spell had cast light on the entire floor, but only as far as she’d walked. The branching corridor was still dark, and not a single undead could be seen from where he stood.\n“They’ve already hidden themselves again. If we keep going, we’ll just run into another ambush. Granted, we know it’s coming, but I’d rather not do that again.”\nMenes nodded as he got to his feet slowly.\n“We could set traps and fortify this location. If we need to retreat—”\n“An extended battle like that is risky. We’d be looking over our shoulders the entire time, and we’d never know we got them all.”\nYvlon sighed as she wiped her sword clean with a cloth.\n“Those Crypt Lords are deadly. We need to take them out first. Do that and the rest of the undead lose a lot of their threat.”\n“Do we have any way of detecting them? A spell?”\n“We could search for trapped rooms, but we’ll burn through magic fast that way. It’s risky.”\nCervial bared his teeth.\n“There’s no way in hell I’m retreating, not without a huge pile of gold to put on my people’s tombstones.”\n“I’m right with you, but how—?”\n“I have a plan.”\nEvery adventurer turned, and the arguing stopped as Calruz spoke. Ceria looked up from her second mana potion and had to stop herself from raising her eyebrows. Calruz? His plans were about as complex as a Goblin’s, and everyone knew it. Including him. He left all of the finesse to Gerial and Ceria.\nBut the Minotaur had taken the stage, and it was her job to back him up. Or kick him in the tail if he said something really stupid.\n“We should face them all at once.”\nCeria’s foot\ntwitched\n, but Gregor was quicker.\n“Are you\nmad\n, Calruz? Why in the hells do you want to do that? They nearly tore us apart in that ambush, and you want to take on the rest all at once?”\nThe Minotaur snorted at him.\n“You speak of seeking them out in their homes, but that is foolish. We are\nadventurers\n. We are stronger than they are. If we remove the element of surprise and cowardly attacks from behind, we stand a better chance of wiping them out at once than fighting with our backs to the walls every five minutes.”\nThe other Captains and vice-Captains fell silent at that. Yvlon raised her eyebrows and looked at Menes, who nodded.\n“Calruz is right. In a straight battle without an ambush, we’d hold the advantage. If we could turn it into that, I’d place all my bets on our side winning handily. But how do you propose we do that, Calruz? Those monsters aren’t exactly smart, but they’re clever enough not to commit to an all-out attack. You saw how they retreated once we put the barriers up.”\n“I will lure them out. If one of you possesses a [Loudness] spell or something similar, I will provoke them into attacking.”\n“I know that spell. But are the rest of you agreed…?”\nMenes glanced around. Yvlon hesitated before nodding, but Gregor and Cervial were already picking up their weapons.\nCalruz glanced around.\n“You. [Tactician]. Do you have any skills that would turn the tide of battle?”\nOlesm gulped.\n“Yes. A…a few. One good one. Should I use it now…?”\n“No. Wait. We will recover a while longer. And then we will go and destroy those who would take our own.”\nCalruz’s eyes flashed. He lifted his battleaxe, and the adventurers began to stand. It swept over them, a moment of passion that turned to anger. They had been attacked. Hurt. Some of their friends had died. It was time to fight again.\nCeria felt the same mood swing through her. She eyed her wand and estimated that she could cast quite a number of spells before she ran out of mana. Yes, the undead had struck first and done damage. But they hadn’t killed the adventurers.\nNow it was their turn to strike back.",

    "text": "Calruz strode down the corridor and waited as the adventurers formed up around him. He hadn’t gone too far from their room, which was now their camp for the wounded and where they’d fittingly placed their dead. He waited with his hands on his axe as Menes cast the spell to amplify his voice.\n“Done. I’ll cast a [Muffle] spell so we don’t get the worst of whatever you’re about to do.”\nCalruz nodded. He stared into the darkness. All of the undead had vanished into the darkness, leaving only the truly dead behind. Yvlon stood next to Calruz, staring up at him curiously.\n“Do you have [Taunt] as a Skill? I don’t know if that would even work on the dead…”\n“Pah.”\nThat single word echoed loudly in the darkness. Calruz’s already loud, rumbling voice had been amplified several times over so that Yvlon winced. He motioned her back silently and whispered, which was still louder than shouting with the spell in effect.\n“I do not need a Skill. Be ready. When they attack, we will crush them.”\nYvlon nodded and stepped back into line. This time, all of the best warriors and the other four adventuring Captains were in front, with all the mages and archers towards the back. Ceria stood next to Sostrom, heart beating rapidly. Assuming Calruz’s undisclosed plan worked, they would be in a perfect position to meet the undead. If he knew what he was doing.\nWhen the [Muffle] spell had been cast, Calruz narrowed his eyes. He raised his battleaxe and gripped it tightly. Then he raised his voice and shouted.\nNo. Not just shouted. His first word made Ceria’s ears\nring\n, and she went temporarily deaf as his voice rumbled through the entire building.\n“\nPathetic spirits of the dead! I am Calruz, leader of the Horns of Hammerad! By the House of Minos, I challenge you. If there is any honor left yet in your defiled corpses—face me and meet your end!\n”\nOutside the ruins, the guardsmen and adventurers standing guard in front of the building looked around. They thought they’d heard something, and the shifting of dirt within made them reach for their weapons. But no attack came. Above, that was.\nEven with both her hands covering her ears and the [Muffle] spell, Ceria could still only hear ringing after Calruz had finished. His voice had echoed in her\nbones,\nand she felt almost nauseous as well.\nShe tried to say something and realized she still wasn’t hearing. She shouted and heard a bit of sound.\n“What?”\nSostrom looked at her. Ceria pointed. He looked and then saw it.\nMovement. In the shadows, in the darkness of the long corridor at the edges of where Ceria’s [Illumination] spell had been cast, things moved. A huge shape appeared, and grinning teeth and long claws made of yellowed bones moved into view.\nOne Crypt Lord, and then two, three…\nfour\nof them appeared out of the darkness, followed by a horde of the dead. They opened their mouths and howled at Calruz as the Minotaur took his place in the line of adventurers.\n“Strike me blind, Calruz!”\nGerial had to shout above the ringing of his ears. He grinned wildly at the Minotaur as Calruz bared his teeth at him.\n“How’d you know that would work?”\n“The dead do not like sound any more than you do. It is an intrusion. I have challenged their honor. And so—we begin!”\nMenes really should have taken the [Loudness] spell off of Calruz. He did, but only after the Minotaur’s large voice had set everyone’s ears ringing a second time. The Minotaur pointed.\nThe undead were indeed massing to charge. The adventurers waited, hearts beating, ears filled with echoes of thunder.\nOlesm cleared his throat. Ceria thought he did, at any rate. She was still having trouble hearing, but the Drake spoke loudly.\n“It looks like it’s my turn.”\n“What?”\n“I said—never mind. Here!”\nThe Drake pointed as the undead began to run down the long corridor. He opened his mouth, and Ceria heard the words clearly.\n“[Attack Formation].”\nAll of the adventures gasped and looked around. As Olesm had spoken, the weapons and armor they carried felt like they had grown lighter. Even the mages felt a second wind, and their magic came to them more strongly than before.\nCeria gaped at Olesm as he grinned at her.\n“What was\nthat?\nA Skill?”\nHe nodded.\n“I can only do that once a day at my level. But yes—it can change a battle. The rest of my skills are mostly defensive or information-oriented, so this is all I can do.”\n“What?”\n“Never mind!”\nThe undead were running now, closing the long distance at alarming speed. Olesm raised his voice again as he pointed to one of the Crypt Lords. It was the one Ceria had hit with the fireball, and though it had eaten some eyes, it was still half-blind as well.\n“That one is more injured than the rest. Bring it down first.”\nThe [Mages] around him nodded as they readied their spells. Ceria watched the undead approach. Cervial loosed crossbow bolt after crossbow bolt with the other three adventurers in his group, felling zombies and skeletons, but the Crypt Lords and the rest of the horde ran on.\nYvlon raised her voice as the undead drew closer. They were around thirty meters away and closing ever faster. She unsheathed her sword and pointed.\n“\nMages!\n”\nThe magic casters needed no further invitation. Ceria and Sostrom pointed their wands and loosed their spells along with the other casters, filling the hallway with magic as the warriors kept their heads down.\nThe first row of undead met a wave of magic and simply…vanished. Lightning crackled through gouts of flame, and spiraling bolts of energy blew limbs apart. Not all the magic had gone into the attack though; pools of slippery liquid appeared on the ground, slowing the undead, and a second wall of flames turned a group of zombies into screaming torches.\nHalf of the mages loosed another spell before the undead were too close. Calruz stood upright, and Gregor shouted.\n“Now, warriors, follow me!\nCharge!\n”\nThe armed rose to their feet and roared, drowning out the howling of the undead as they ran straight at the undead. Ceria saw the first zombie raise its hand to strike Gerial before Calruz’s massive fist punched straight through the zombie’s hand.\nThe adventurers and undead collided in a crash of sound that nearly rendered Ceria deaf again. But she was already running with the other mages, firing shards of ice at one of the Crypt Lords as she did.",

    "text": "All was motion. Gerial spun and cleaved the head off of one zombie effortlessly. He felt like his body was on fire. He felt like his\nheart\nwas on fire. He was fighting at his best thanks to Olesm’s Skill. And not just him. Around him, the Captains were cutting through the undead now that they didn’t have to worry about hitting allies in front of them.\n“[Whirlwind Cleave]!”\nGregor’s axe scythed through the stomachs of three zombies and a Ghoul, dropping them to the ground where the big man crushed their heads with an armored boot. He turned and barely dodged a Crypt Lord’s massive hand, but Cervial raised his crossbow and loosed a bolt right into the monster’s face.\n“[Point-Blank Shot]!”\nThe flesh around the bolt tore, and the big monster lurched back. Gregor and two other warriors attacked it from below as it tried to recover, and Gerial caught a skeleton that was trying to attack them from behind. He bashed it repeatedly with the pommel of his sword and watched it collapse as he broke a hole in its skull.\nYvlon’s sword tip exited the neck of one zombie as she struck a skeleton in the head with her shield. The blow shattered the undead’s skull, and it collapsed, the crimson light fading from its eyes.\nShe whirled, and her shield came up to block a Ghoul’s slash. She pushed the monster away, and it staggered. Gerial saw Yvlon pull her sword out of the dead man’s stomach, and the Ghoul folded up. He hadn’t even seen her strike.\nGerial turned and found another Crypt Lord about to spit at him and Yvlon. He tackled her to the floor, and the black rain covered another adventurer, who fell to the ground, screaming.\n“Back, back!”\nSomeone yanked Gerial to his feet. He looked up and saw Sostrom as the mage struck the Crypt Lord in the head with several fiery bolts of magic. It roared and seized him in one huge fist.\n“\nSostrom!\n”\nThe mage screamed in agony as the Crypt Lord\nsqueezed\n. Gerial stabbed it in the stomach desperately, but it was too big and wouldn’t let his friend go.\n“Move!”\nHe felt something shove him aside and then Calruz was there. The Minotaur swung his battleaxe, and Sostrom fell to the ground, the severed hand still holding him.\nThe Crypt Lord howled and grabbed at Calruz, but the Minotaur dropped his axe and gripped the undead’s head with both of his hands. He roared in fury as he\nripped\nthe Crypt Lord’s head off. The black blood spurted from the stump and covered the Minotaurs’ fur as he hurled the head and bit of spine away.\n“Gerial! Back me up!”\nGerial nodded and fended off a Ghoul while Calruz reclaimed his axe. The Minotaur’s skin was fizzing where the black blood had landed, and he unceremoniously dumped two potions over his fur and then downed an antidote.\nSeveral feet away, Ceria was in trouble. She’d been separated by Sostrom when the monster grabbed him, and a Ghoul was trying to catch her as she dodged backwards.\nGerial sliced a huge hole in the Ghoul’s side, giving Ceria an opening. She hit the Ghoul with three ice spikes, sending it spinning away.\nA zombie struck Gerial from behind, hitting him in the back and knocking him to the floor. It fell on Gerial, biting and tearing as he shouted for help.\nCeria didn’t hesitate. She pointed her wand at the zombie’s back.\n“[Flashfire]!”\nInstantly, the zombie burst into flames. It stopped clawing at Gerial and started writhing, trying to put out the flames. Gerial shoved the corpse off him and got to his feet. The zombie tried to crawl after him, but Calruz ran forward and bashed its skull in with a single kick.\n“How many Crypt Lords are down?”\n“Two—no, three!”\nGregor had just cleaved the head off of the Crypt Lord he’d been fighting. The last monstrous undead hesitated as its minions surrounded it.\n“I will take care of it if you get me close.”\n“Done!”\nCeria nodded, and she and Sostrom ran towards Menes. The mage turned, and then all three began blasting at the undead, sending charred and broken bodies spinning to the ground.\nCalruz looked at Gerial as the other man panted for air.\n“With me?”\n“Of course!”\nThey charged into the ranks of the undead. Gerial body-rushed a skeleton and planted his sword in a zombie’s chest as Calruz swung his axe and sent body parts flying. The Crypt Lord raised its head and stared at the Minotaur, possibly seeing a threat in the only creature larger than it was.\nIt raised its clawed hands at the same time Calruz raised his blade. Gerial knew what he was going to do and ran backwards as Calruz roared.\nThe Minotaur brought down his axe, cutting through the Crypt Lord’s twisted arms as it tried to block. He cleaved downwards, not stopping for bone or sinew as he vertically bisected the front part of the Crypt Lord’s body and struck the ground in an impact that smashed the stone floor.\nEven from several feet away, Ceria felt the\nimpact\nin her bones. The Crypt Lord lay on the ground, bones and skin twisted and torn.\nThe undead faltered and then began to attack again. But suddenly, they were without their controlling intelligence. Calruz roared, and the adventurers formed up around him. They pressed the undead back, back, until they hit a wall and were ground into paste upon it.\nIn the silence after the battle, Olesm shakily walked around the few twitching corpses and stared at the Crypt Lord Calruz had killed with his [Hammer Blow] skill. He stared at Calruz as the Minotaur leaned on his battleaxe, panting.\n“I—I didn’t hear you say anything.”\nCalmly, Calruz raised his axe and shook the bits of gore from it.\n“Not every Skill or spell must be shouted.”\nThe Drake nodded slowly and looked around. The battle was over. He looked at his own sword. He’d hung back and fought with the mages, but he’d still killed several zombies and skeletons. He felt shaky, sick, exhausted as the adrenaline left him. He looked at Ceria as the half-Elf downed another mana potion and wiped at her mouth.\n“We’re alive. Now what?”\nThe half-Elf grinned at Olesm, threw up a bit as the mana potion ran through her system, and grinned even harder. Blood and entrails had painted her face, but she didn’t seem to mind.\n“Now? Now we get the treasure.”\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "“What about this room?”\n“Empty.”\nSostrom shook his head as he walked out of another dark room, his staff glowing. Calruz stomped out behind him, growling irately. Ceria tried not to scowl at her friend, but it was hard.\n“Not a thing?”\n“You can see for yourself.”\nSostrom pointed into the dark room and shook his head. He traced a line of pallid blue light, too pale to be natural, in a cone around the worn stone.\nSmooth stone, possibly painted once, but fragmented away.\nDust and tiny insects skittered away from the light, and it fell upon a marvel of architecture.\nDeep, carved passages, even the rough, broken reliefs of what had once perhaps been complex statues. Now—smashed and rotted with age. A marvel, still, to [Builders] looking for decent stone or perhaps [Historians].\nNothing for adventurers. Faceless, eyeless statues revealed only gaping wounds where what might have once been valuable metal or gems. Someone had been here first—and if there had been books, cloth, aught at all beyond the bleak stone and rubbish strewn about—even wood had crumbled to dust.\nSostrom’s staff glowed brighter as he set it down with a sigh.\n“Whatever was in here, it wasn’t a treasury. And now it’s long gone.”\n“Damn.”\nCeria cursed and kicked at the ground. Olesm peered over her shoulder into the empty room. He shuddered as a handful of crypt beetles scurried away. But then he looked peeved.\n“I don’t get it. This is the lowest level, isn’t it? And you said there would be treasure—”\n“I did. But who knew this place would be so cursed\nbig?\n”\n“But the treasure’s around here somewhere, right?”\nCeria growled at Olesm, and he backed away, claws raised. Gerial put a hand on her shoulder, but she sensed the tension in it too.\n“Most likely. We just haven’t found it yet, and we’re all tired. Why don’t you go with Sostrom and check those rooms out?”\nSostrom made a face, but walked with Olesm down the dark corridor to peer into another room.\nCeria made a face and patted Gerial’s hand with hers. She turned, lowering her voice. She felt embarrassed—she was the veteran here. She couldn’t act like a child.\n“Sorry, Gerial.”\n“I know how you’re feeling. But he’s trying to be helpful.”\n“Plus, this is his first adventure, and he thinks this is going to be Chalence and we’ll be famous like all the greenhorns.\nI know.\nIt’s just—”\nIt was later. In fact, it was two hours later. The last of the undead had been killed and their remains incinerated with a spell, and those adventurers wounded too badly to move had been sent back to the burial room. A few more had remained as guards in case more undead popped up, but the rest had been searching nonstop since then.\nSearching for treasure.\n“Any word from Gregor’s team?”\nThey’d split into two groups, one going down the left passage, the other the right. Of all the teams, Calruz’s hadn’t lost any adventurers besides Hunt in either battle, so they’d taken a few of Menes’ mages while the other adventurers under Gregor had gone left. Yvlon had remained with the wounded, and they were keeping up a stream of communications with several adventurers who ran messages across the vast ruins.\n“We just had one come by. There he is—”\nGerial led Ceria towards a panting adventurer drinking water and talking to Calruz.\n“Any word on the other team’s progress?”\nThe man made a face.\n“Nothing substantial. They’ve come across more empty rooms, same as you. Dozens upon dozens of them. It’s a warren down here, I swear. There’s some kind of urns in one room—just filled with dust, whatever’s in them is long gone. Old scrolls in another, none magical. They found a few undead, but nothing else. How’s it going over here?”\n“Uneventful. We killed a few zombies, but they’re mostly cleared out here as well. Has Yvlon seen anything?”\n“Nothing. I’ll get back to Gregor’s side of things if you’ve nothing else.”\nCalruz grunted irritably, and the man took off. Gerial shook his head as he watched the man jog slowly off into the darkness, a ball of light following him.\n“This is where a Runner would have come in handy.”\n“This is where a hundred Runners would come in handy. They could search this place faster than we can.”\nCeria kicked at a wall. She knew she was frustrated, but she was exhausted from fighting and irritable from countless annoying questions from a certain Drake. Calruz had suggested quite sensibly—which was surprising—that instead of splitting up, their team should move together closely to avoid unpleasant surprises. The need to check each room and hallway for traps or ambushes had saved them a few nasty surprises, but it meant they were moving at a snail’s pace.\nThe fire of battle had left all the adventurers tired, it was true, but more than even that made the searching arduous. The ruins had become silent once more, and somehow, without the presence of the undead, it made everything feel more ominous.\nCeria kept expecting another zombie to pop out of the shadows, and one or two had—but the feeling hadn’t disappeared. The worst thing about an ambush is that you didn’t stop worrying after you survived one.\nRather, you kept worrying it was only the first.\nGerial was probably feeling the same, but he still tried to be reasonable.\n“You know he’s never done this before. And he helped us get through that fight a lot more easily than we would have otherwise. Just don’t snap at him.”\n“I know. I\nknow.\nBut he keeps asking and—what if he’s right?”\n“Yeah.”\nGerial, Ceria, and Calruz all fell silent. Treasure. They were all certain—had been certain—it was down here. You didn’t have ruins with this many guardians without treasure of some kind. But what if the valuable goods had been knowledge or something more intangible?\nWhat if the dead had just congregated here because this was a glorified graveyard, and the only goods were the few bags of gold and jewels they’d recovered from the dead adventurers? It was a good haul for a single team, but wouldn’t even recoup the losses of their expedition.\nRuins could potentially be sources of amazing wealth, like the Ruins of Albez where magical items were still hidden under the rubble. But sometimes ruins were just old.\nYou heard stories, sometimes, of adventurers who would fight their way down to the lowest part of a dungeon, sacrificing all they had, losing friends and bleeding each step of the way to discover they’d cleared out an ancient storage house for grain or the living quarters of some subterranean people. That was the nightmare that hid behind the dream, and Ceria and the other adventurers were living it right now.\n“We’ve still got a ways to go. There’s plenty of chances the vault is just ahead.”\n“Sure.”\nCeria nodded, and Calruz grunted. She sighed and was about to stand up when she heard pounding feet.\nAll three adventurers grabbed at their weapons, and the others down the hall turned, ready for battle. But the woman who ran towards them was beaming and waving her arms.\n“We’ve found something! Possibly a treasury!”\nThe shock that ran through Ceria was electric. She smiled, and the other adventurers whooped and cheered.\n“Where is it? How big?”\n“It’s right at the other end of the ruins, down the other passage.”\nThe woman pointed back as she explained.\n“We’re not sure it’s a treasury, but it has every sign of—they’ve found a huge pair of double doors. Sealed. Magical runes of warding on the front, and Menes says some of them look like warnings.”\nCeria frowned at the same time Gerial did.\n“Wait a second. That’s doesn’t sound like a vault to me. It sounds like a\nguarded\ntreasury, the kind that has the nastiest monster waiting right behind the door. You didn’t try to open it, right?”\nThe adventurer rolled her eyes.\n“We’re not idiots. Menes and the other mages are already setting up traps near the entrance with Cervial’s team. Yvlon wants a hallway full of traps before we crack the seal.”\nShe grinned. Like Ceria, she had a streak of blood wiped from one of her nostrils down her chin, and it was cracked and dried like the healed bite wound that had ripped across one shoulder. But she was\nalive.\nThis—this was adventuring.\n“Cervial’s group even has two bear traps. Don’t know how they carried them all the way down, but they’re setting them up. Even if what’s inside is as big as an Ogre, it won’t be able to ignore\nthat.\n”\nCeria had seen the iron and occasionally steel contraptions used to hunt bears and larger monsters. Not just black bears or brown ones, but\nMossbears. Mothbears too.\nThey were nasty, vicious, and she’d nearly stepped in one more than once in her homeland. Damn [Trappers]. She shuddered, but it was a fine weapon to use on a monster.\n“As soon as you lot finish on your side, we’ll seal off this passage with a spell and open those doors. Yvlon is going to join us, and we’ll see exactly what’s inside. Menes says the runes might be warning of the undead guardians, and if so, we just killed them all!”\n“Or more could be inside. Wait for us.”\nCalruz was, again, the surprising voice of caution, but he sounded eager. The woman nodded impatiently.\n“We’ll have so many damn traps and fall-back points we’ll kill a thousand of ‘em once we’re set up. How soon until you’ll be done here? Gregor wants to know.”\nCeria and Gerial looked at Calruz. He shrugged.\n“We’ve found nothing of worth so far. Give us a few minutes to gather everyone, and we’ll follow you.”\n“Well, hurry up. Gregor wants to crack the seal this instant, and the other two Captains are the only thing holding him back.”\nThe woman grinned and dashed back as the other adventurers began to chatter excitedly. Ceria and Gerial exchanged a look.\n“Warded doors? That’s right out of one of those classic stories you hear about. Odds are three-to-one it’s trapped or something nasty is lurking inside. Gregor better not open them before we get there.”\n“He’s no idiot. But Yvlon has the right idea. Regardless of what’s in there, we can turn the passageway into a killing field. Even ten Crypt Lords wouldn’t survive a fully spelled passage if we combine resources.”\n“Hey, hey everyone!”\nThat voice came from behind the others. They turned to see Olesm running towards them, beaming in excitement.\n“Olesm? You’ll never believe this, but we found something! A vault, sealed by magic, over on the other side of the ruins.”\nThe Drake skidded to a stop and gaped. He grinned.\n“Really? That’s great news! But we found something as well!”\n“You did?”\nCeria exchanged a glance with the others, but they followed as Olesm eagerly led the way back down the corridor. They stopped at a huge opening in the wall, possibly where doors had once stood. Olesm pointed in.\n“Look—but be quiet!”\nHe pointed, and Ceria gasped as she stared into a massive room. It was some kind of crypt. Well, the whole ruins were a giant crypt. Only this was\nthe\ncrypt inside of the crypt. What that all meant was—\n“Tombs.”\n“Coffins.”\nHundreds of them. Each one was stone, spaced apart evenly in a room that was so large it made Ceria feel as if she was standing outside again. She could barely see the far wall. The only light in the massive room came from a single staff. Sostrom was just inside, staring at one of the walls.\n“This is the place where all the dead go.”\nOlesm whispered loudly in Ceria’s ear.\n“It must have countless tombs, probably with a lot of important people! And probably treasure if they bury their dead with their valuables like we Drakes do!”\nThat was true, but Ceria stared at the tombs and had another thought.\n“They could all be undead in those graves. There’s no telling how many of them reanimated with the Crypt Lords about.”\nThe other adventurers crowding behind her groaned and grabbed at their weapons. Gerial shushed them while Olesm whispered.\n“That’s what Sostrom said. But he found something else in there as well.”\nHe pointed, and Ceria saw the mage looking up at something on the wall. She nudged Calruz, and he nodded, so Ceria slowly approached with the others.\nSostrom jumped when Ceria put her hand on his shoulder. He whirled, staff raised, and relaxed when he saw her face. He bent down and whispered to her.\n“Ceria. You nearly scared the piss out of me.”\n“Better that than you screaming. What are you looking at?”\nCarefully, Sostrom edged to one side and raised his staff higher so Ceria could get a look at what he was seeing. The blue-white light illuminated a dark stone wall, but etched into it deeply were…\n“Words?”\n“Something like that. It’s not magic—at least, no runes I’ve seen before. But what language it is I can’t tell for the life of me.”\nCeria stared up at the strange words, if words they were. She was familiar with several written languages and she had travelled far and wide, but for all that, she had never seen this style of writing. She beckoned, and Olesm softly padded over with the other adventurers following.\n“Olesm. What do you make of this?”\nThe Drake frowned up at the wall as Gerial turned, watching the rest of the room for movement. There was none, but the countless tombs disturbed him greatly. He could just imagine something creeping up on them while they studied the wall, and so he faced the other way while his friends conferred.\n“I’m not sure. It looks like some kind of message, but is it a memorial or something else? A memorandum? The script…looks familiar.”\nCeria peered at him. Her first instinct was to assume it was Drake writing. Everyone spoke the same language, obviously, but the Drakes and other species had different written languages.\n“You can’t read it? Does it look like something your people might have written long ago?”\nHe hesitated.\n“It—it\ncould\nbe something written in the past. Like I said, it’s vaguely similar. But I never knew if we changed written languages.\nI\ncertainly can’t read it.”\n“Is this important?”\nGerial winced as Calruz’s voice echoed through the room. The Minotaur wasn’t worried about waking anything. He folded his arms as he stared at the carvings.\n“It could be nothing. But it might give us a clue as to what this place was or what it contains.”\n“But you cannot read it.”\n“I can.”\nGerial twisted his head and stared at Ceria in disbelief. She was raising her wand, and the color had changed to a light purple as she illuminated the wall.\n“A little spell I picked up when I was at Wistram. [Translate].”\nSostrom whistled softly.\n“\nThat’s\nhandy.”\nMarian laughed.\n“Handy? For what? No one speaks a different language. It’s only good for reading books.”\nSostrom hesitated, reluctant to contradict his crush. But Calruz just buffeted her with one arm. Gently, for him.\n“Fool. Drathians have their own language. And to read any tome, no matter how old, is a valuable ability. You uncultured Izrilians.”\nCeria nodded absently as the words glowed faintly with purple light. She frowned, concentrating as she spoke.\n“It is. But I’d prefer a real translator even so. The spell takes time, and it doesn’t work unless there are enough words to read at once. And I often get a muddled message, sometimes nonsensical depending on the content. There are better spells. But it should…oh.”\nNone of the other adventures saw anything change, but Ceria’s pulse began to quicken as the words on the wall—\nThey didn’t exactly change, but somehow she understood them. And she could put them into her own language. She turned to Olesm, eyes wide.\n“I really don’t think this is a memorial for the dead.”\n“What? What does it say?”\n“I—it’s disturbing. Really disturbing.”\nCalruz snorted. He glanced at Ceria’s face and barked.\n“We are not mewling Human children. Speak.”\nThe half-Elf hesitated, and then she cleared her throat and began to read haltingly. The words she read were almost like a song and had the same cadence, the same innocent rhymes. Her words were swallowed by the darkness of the massive room.\n“Skinner, Skinner!\nHe’ll eat your tails and tear off your skin!\nHe’ll pluck out your eyeballs and devour your kin!\nSkinner, Skinner!\nRun while you can!\nYour flesh will be taken with a touch of his hand!\nHide in the darkness, hide in the light.\nFighting is useless; Skinner is fright.",

    "text": "He takes our scales and hides our bones\nAnd makes this place our very last home.\nSkinner, Skinner, never open his door.\nOr soon your bones will lie on this floor.”\nWhen she finished, there was only silence. Then one of the other adventurers laughed nervously, and someone else joined him. Their laughter echoed in the vast room and then faded away uneasily.\nGerial didn’t laugh. Neither did Calruz or most of the other adventurers. Ceria’s face was as pale as the light of her wand, and the glowing words faded again, letting darkness creep back.\nGerial’s voice cracked a bit as he spoke.\n“That was disturbing, to say the least. But what does that mean?”\nSostrom hesitated as he stared at the words on the wall.\n“It sounds…almost like a nursery rhyme. But not one I’d ever tell any child of mine.”\nOlesm shivered.\n“I’ve never heard that…\nthat\nkind of song before. Who in their right minds would write such a thing?”\n“It was a warning.”\nCeria whispered the words, and Calruz nodded. The Minotaur’s hand was twitching towards the handle of his battleaxe, and that made Gerial even more nervous. He tried to laugh it off, but couldn’t bring himself to smile.\n“A warning? Who writes their warnings so—so cryptically?”\n“Maybe someone who’s afraid of speaking plainly. Or—or—this isn’t a warning. Maybe it\nis\na nursery rhyme or just dark humor. Or an old myth. The kind you write of something that’s been around forever.”\nSostrom shook his head.\n“Who is this ‘Skinner’, then? An undead? Or a [Necromancer] of some kind? Whoever wrote this message seems to fear him.”\n“Perhaps he’s the reason this place exists.”\nOlesm frowned as he looked around the room. The other adventurers blinked at him, and he pointed to the tombs.\n“This is clearly a burial place, but that’s odd because we Drakes don’t tend to bury our dead in stone. Too expensive. We usually cremate them. But that line…”\nHe stared upwards and murmured.\n“‘\nHe takes our scales and hides our bones…’\n. That can only be my people who wrote this. So—so they built coffins to hide their flesh from him? But is he locked away with the dead down here? That would make no sense. Why not burn the bodies? Surely they’d want to keep him as far away as possible.”\nSostrom raised a finger.\n“A thought. Was this a trap for this Skinner creature or—or is he the guardian of this place?”\nMore silence. Gerial shivered. He felt cold, the uneasy chill of fear he’d felt on the most dangerous of missions. He opened his mouth, but another adventurer raised his voice.\n“What the hell is a Skinner? Some kind of special undead?”\n“We don’t know. But odds are\nthat\nis what’s hiding behind that door Gregor and the others found. We should go back and let them know we’re in for a fight.”\nCalruz nodded.\n“Agreed. We will hold off opening them until we are prepared. And perhaps—”\nHe hesitated.\n“—Perhaps we should send word to the surface. Ask if any know of this ‘Skinner’ creature.”\nCeria nodded. She felt relieved that he was the voice of reason, for once. She turned.\n“Let’s hurry before Gregor makes a mistake. I’ll go f—”\nIt happened suddenly. Ceria screamed and dropped her wand, her hands flying to her head. Gerial drew his sword, but other adventurers around him were shouting or falling too. He looked around wildly, but nothing was attacking them.\nHalf of the Horns of Hammerad clutched at their heads. Ceria fell to her knees. Her [Dangersense] was going off, but it wasn’t like the ambush. That had been a premonition. Fear, foreboding, the knowledge of danger suddenly chilling her to her core.\nThis—\nThis was terror. This was death. She heard howling in her mind and knew she would die if she stayed. She—\n“Ceria!”\nCalruz’s massive hand shook her back into reality. She looked up at him. He yanked her upright with one hand.\n“On your feet! What’s happening?”\n“My [Dangersense]—something just happened! The doors—the vault—”\nHe cursed.\n“They opened them? The fools!”\nHe began to storm down the corridor, but Ceria grabbed at him.\n“Calruz! This isn’t like before. This—my Skill is telling me something bad has happened.\nReally\nbad. Far worse than the ambush.”\nHe stared at her, only partly comprehending. He couldn’t feel the certainty, the absolute terror in her head and heart. Olesm stumbled towards them, sword drawn.\n“We are in danger.\nExtreme\ndanger. We have to retreat.”\nOlesm shakily wiped at his mouth. He’d thrown up. His tail thrashed wildly as he stared around in the darkness.\n“I’ve\nnever\nfelt anything like that. When I was a child and the Necromancer attacked ten years back—that was the closest. But this is different. I am afraid, and [Dangersense] doesn’t convey fear. We have to go.”\nThe Necromancer himself? Gerial’s face turned paler. Calruz looked at Olesm a full five seconds before he turned.\n“Let us regroup with Yvlon. With speed. [Warriors], form up, and mages, follow close behind. Prepare for—”\nHe broke off as Ceria grabbed his arm. The Minotaur stared down at her as she looked around.\n“Shh! Quiet. Do you hear that?”\nThe other adventurers fell silent. It took them only a second to make out what Ceria had heard. In the distance, a high pitched sound. No—\nmany\nsounds, all joined together.\n“Screaming.”\nIt was faint, but echoed down the long corridor into this room. And as if that had started something, they heard another noise.\nCracking. Dull\nthumps\nsounding from behind them. Muffled moans and hissing. The adventurers turned.\nGerial’s hand turned white on his sword. He stared at the coffins in the room as, suddenly, noises began to echo from within.\n“Oh…Flowers of Izril. Five Families preserve us.”\nHalf of the lids of the stone coffins\nshifted\nor crashed to the ground as their occupants suddenly began to move. The adventurers’ light didn’t illuminate all of the room, but they saw things crawling out of their stone beds, jerking upright, faint pinpricks of crimson light flaring into existence as they stared at the living.\nTheir moans and ghastly sounds filled the huge room, echoing, growing louder—then they\nscreamed\nas they got up and began running towards the living.\n“\nRun!\n”\nGerial wasn’t sure who said it. It could have been him. But every adventurer in the room was suddenly running for the door as hundreds of undead began pouring towards them.\n“The door!”\nCalruz caught Sostrom as the mage ran out the double doors. He pointed to the corridor.\n“Can you slow them down?”\nThe bald man hesitated. He raised his staff.\n“I—I could cast [Sticky Ground]. The webbing would slow them down, but this many—”\n“Cast it! The rest of you, follow me!”\nCalruz started running before the words had even left his mouth. Sostrom desperately raised his staff and cast the spell as the other adventurers sprinted down the corridor after Calruz. Suddenly, the lower levels were filled with sounds again, the clash of metal, surprised shouts from up ahead.\nScreaming.\nSostrom caught up with Ceria, his longer legs pumping madly as he ran with his staff raised before him. He shouted wildly.\n“We don’t have much time! Only a few minutes before they catch up!”\nNo one else said a word. They pounded down the corridor, and when they rounded a corridor, they saw a group of armed adventurers, around fourteen of them, led by Yvlon. They raised their weapons but lowered them when they saw who it was.\n“Calruz!”\nYvlon waved the Minotaur over as he ran towards her. Her sword was drawn, and she had formed up her group into a solid line blocking the corridor down which Gregor had gone.\nCalruz paused and pointed. Ceria and Gerial fell into line with the other adventurers, covering the way they had come as the Minotaur talked with Yvlon.\n“What’s happening? Where are Gregor and the others?”\nShe shook her head.\n“Last I heard, they were up ahead, trapping the corridor. But then our [Dangersense] went off and—the door. They must have opened it.”\n“Fools!”\n“They didn’t say they were going to open the vault. I made it clear to Gregor he had to wait until we regrouped. So why…?”\n“Have you sent anyone down there?”\nCalruz looked down the dark corridor, and Yvlon nodded.\n“Two people. I told them to run back the instant they saw something. They—they never came back.”\nShe looked pale.\n“The screaming ended a few minutes ago. I was waiting for you to get back. What did you find? Anything?”\nHe nodded.\n“A message. Too long to explain. Know that we most likely face Skinner, the guardian of this place. He—steals skin.”\n“Steals? Skin?”\nThe other adventurer shifted restlessly. Calruz nodded.\n“So it was written. And his awakening woke the other undead too. There is a horde approaching from behind.”\nThe adventurers groaned as Yvlon frowned.\n“Right then, it seems we have a choice. We can’t fight another battle here, not understrength. We should retreat.”\nCalruz shook his head.\n“What of Gregor and the others?”\nHer face was grim.\n“I think we should fear the worst, don’t you?”\nCalruz gritted his teeth.\n“I do not want to run without seeing the enemy’s face.”\n“It’ll be the\nlast\nthing you see if we stay here. If we get caught in a pincer attack from both sides—”\n“Calruz.”\nThe Minotaur ignored Ceria. He gestured to the corridor back where they had come.\n“Set spells to slow the enemy advance. I will go to see if there are any living before we fall back. If we leave our comrades—”\n“\nCalruz!\n”\nBoth Captains looked over. Ceria was cupping one pointed ear with her hand. She raised her wand shakily and pointed into the darkness ahead.\n“I hear something. Something is coming this way.”\nThey fell silent and then heard it too. Pounding footsteps.\nSostrom raised his staff, but hesitated as he saw an adventurer run out of the darkness. It was one man, someone he recognized. A warrior from Kyrial’s Vanguard. The man wasn’t carrying a weapon, though. He was wild-eyed and running as if chased by a legion of monsters. But nothing was following him.\nGerial stood up and caught the man as he ran towards the adventurers. He would have bowled over their front line, and he tried to dodge around Gerial as the other man grabbed at him.\n“Hey, what’s happening? Where are Gregor and—”\nThe other warrior struck at Gerial with a gauntleted fist. Gerial stumbled back, and the man tried to run past him. Calruz seized him and pinned him against a wall.\n“You! How dare you?”\nThe man stared up wild-eyed into Calruz’s furious gaze. He didn’t even seem to see the Minotaur. He twisted wildly in Calruz’s grip, fighting to be free.\n“Let go of me! Let\ngo!\nI have to get away!”\nYvlon stared down the corridor, staring into the darkness.\n“What happened? What was behind those doors?”\nThe man spat and fought against Calruz, futilely kicking to be free. He seemed barely conscious as he babbled almost incoherently.\n“Run,\nrun!\nIt’s right behind us!”\n“What is?”\nCalruz gripped the man even harder until Gerial could swear he heard the other man’s bones\ncreak.\nThe Minotaur raised his voice.\n“\nWhy were the doors opened?\nGregor was told to wait! Who—”\n“We didn’t open the doors!”\nThe Minotaur stared at the man. He was panting, sweating, his eyes darting around as he strained towards freedom.\n“If you did not open them, then who—”\n“\nIt\nopened them from\ninside!\n”\nThe man shouted it in the corridor, his voice echoing as he screamed.\n“\nIt\nopened them, and then it took Gregor and the others! Let me go. It is\ncoming\n. We must run, all of us. Can’t you feel it? It is coming!”\n“Who is? Skinner? Is it an undead?”\nBut the man refused to reply. His foot came up, and he\nkicked\nCalruz hard enough to make the Minotaur grunt and stumble back. He dropped the warrior, and the man scrambled to his feet. He burst through the ranks of adventurers, dashing down the corridor, his footsteps echoing and fading as he fled towards the stairs.\nCalruz cursed as he rubbed at his stomach. He looked at Yvlon, and the two Captains paused.\n“They’re dead. But what caught them? This Skinner—”\n“We should retreat. Let us gather the wounded and go. If we have the [Mages] cast spells to delay pursuit—”\nYvlon nodded. She turned and raised her voice to order the adventurers, but the words died in her throat.\nSomething. Somehow, as they had listened to the panicked adventurer screaming, they hadn’t heard it. It was such a faint sound. A sort of…dragging, scraping sound. It had been growing louder slowly. And it wouldn’t have mattered. But now it had come closer, and—something—had appeared far down the corridor.\nThe light cast from wands, staves, flickering torches, and lanterns illuminated perhaps a hundred feet of space of the wide, empty stone passageway. At the very edges of that light, something had appeared.\nSomething white. It was so far away, but it filled the corridor. It looked like—a cloud? Or fog, rippling slowly towards them out of the darkness. A wall of white that moved.\nBut that wasn’t what caught Yvlon’s voice in her throat. It was the faint thing she could see in the middle of that unearthly cloud, the familiar shape that appeared in the darkness, staring at her.\nA face.\n“Gregor…?”\nHe didn’t react to Yvlon’s voice. The Captain of Kyrial’s Vanguard stared ahead blankly, his face shifting in the mists, pale and bloodless. And his head—it was moving in ways a head shouldn’t, not if it were attached to a body.\nThe white sea surrounding him rippled closer, but now the adventurers could see another face slowly float upwards. Cervial. He stared ahead, gaze empty and vacant, moving in the same disturbing way as Gregor.\n“Cervial! Is that you?”\nAgain, no response.\nCloser. Now the mists didn’t seem as transparent. It wasn’t mist, but something else. Something that rippled and shook as it was pulled along the corridor. Undulating, shivering…too solid. Ceria’s [Dangersense] was screaming so loud she covered her pointed ears. It came on. Closer.\n“Gregor, Cervial! Answer me! What’s going on? Are you alright?”\nNeither face moved. Neither head twitched. The adventurers watched Gregor stare ahead, eyes unseeing.\nThen they knew. They knew what had happened. As Menes’ head emerged from the folds of the creature in front of them and it pulled itself into the light, they understood what they were seeing.\nFlesh. Dead flesh. It rippled, shook, twisted, shining in the light. It was yellowed in places, fleshy pink in others, bloody in spots. But mainly white. White with age and bloodless death. It was dead skin, layered and congealed.\nIt was a body. And the faces of their friends, the Captains—\nThey were part of it.\nNot just their faces. Their skin. As the creature drew closer, several men and women gagged or vomited in place. This—thing was made up of bodies. Entire bodies, skinned. Torn from their owners and pasted together.\nAnd what it made was a long, bloated slug-like body that reared upright. Two massive arms reached out and seized at the ground, dragging the rest of the body behind it. There was no head. Rather, a sunken face, a mockery of the Human face. No nose. No ears or hair. Just two sunken sockets filled with a crimson glow and a gaping, empty mouth.\nPieces of white flesh trailed behind the creature as it pulled itself forwards another ten meters with its hands. It was falling apart, leaving bits of itself where it went. But it was massive, hands wide enough to curl around any Human, long, almost delicate fingers of slick, white flesh, exposed along the palms where red flesh could be seen underneath.\nSomething. Something was living in the body of dead skin. And it was coming. The creature slowly moved towards the adventurers, pulling itself along the ground as the faces of their comrades—all of them—stared blankly ahead, the latest additions to its skin.\nBecause that was what it was. And Ceria knew. She knew as it stared down at her and she felt death in her bones.\nShe knew its name.\nSkinner.",

    "text": "He came towards them, slow, dragging himself along with one arm as he travelled down the corridor. He had no legs. He was just a torso, a disfigured mockery of something Human. Not even that.\nHe wasn’t even remotely humanoid. Unlike the Crypt Lords who looked like bloated, twisted mockeries of something once living, Skinner just looked dead.\nScraps of ruined metal hung off the thing.\nDangling from worn material. A…breastplate? Had something once made armor for this—this thing? Or had it stolen the armor of a Giant? It was far too large and torn apart. All that was left was yellowed skin—and fresh additions.\nCeria knew she should move. She knew she should raise her wand and start blasting at the creature now it had appeared. She should rain fire upon it with the others, eradicate it from the face of the earth. It was in front of her.\nBut she couldn’t move. She couldn’t raise her wand. She was petrified.\nTwo ruby eyes flashed deep within the folds of dried, caked skin. They didn’t move, not like normal eyes. Skinner had to twist and turn his head to see with them, but the light they cast created a cone of—of—\nTerror.\nIt had struck her the instant he had appeared down the corridor. Something had reached inside her, taken hold of her heart. She\nshook\nas he approached, and she was unable to move.\n“It’s just…dead\nskin.\n”\nYvlon muttered it. Ceria had to turn her head to see. The woman was trembling, hand gripped on her sword. She was trying to raise it, but she couldn’t.\nFear.\n“We’re under a spell.”\nCeria said it through numb lips. She tried to gather mana inside of her, fight off the magic, but it was too strong. Terror was consuming all of her. She couldn’t even think of resisting. All she wanted to do was run.\nBut she was too afraid to do even that.\nIt was like the nightmares Ceria had had as a child, in between waking and sleep, at midnight. She would be in her bed, staring at a door, a window. She knew something was behind it, that something was watching her. She knew, but she was too afraid to get up and see. If she moved—if she made any motion—it would get her.\nSo she would lie still, and eventually she would fall asleep or morning would come. Her night terrors would disappear in the light of day.\nBut this was different. This was horror made flesh, and it wouldn’t disappear. But like her childhood fears, Ceria was trapped. She couldn’t move.\n“Horns of Hammerad—”\nCalruz’s voice choked in their silence. She saw him raise a foot and struggle to step forwards. Even the Minotaur, even her fearless leader, was paralyzed.\n“We must—retreat.”\nOlesm said that. He was trying to shift backwards, but even escape was difficult. They were paralyzed.\nSkinner pulled himself closer. Too close. He was in front of them now, and they smelled him. Dead flesh. Blood, too. Blood and death and rot. It was horrific.\nHis eyes gazed down on them, bringing fear. Calruz tried to raise his axe, but his arms shook. Skinner’s mouth opened.\nHe smiled.\nA hand shot out. A woman in the front—a warrior with an axe and shield—screamed in sudden terror. It brought the other adventurers out of their paralysis. They scattered as Skinner encircled her with one hand and then\npulled\n.\nHer skin came off. All at once. It left—it left a bloody body that fell to the ground. Possibly dead. Or worse—alive.\nThe woman’s skin flapped and trembled in Skinner’s hand. He reached up and laid it delicately across one arm. Her skin…\nmelted\ninto his flesh, and suddenly, there she was. Her empty face stared down at the others.\nThey fled. Their terror hadn’t ended, just\nshifted\n. Instead, the seasoned Silver-rank adventurers dropped their weapons and ran, pushing, shoving, trying to get away.\nBut as they turned to flee in the other direction, they found they were not alone. Bodies stood in the way, blocking the corridor. Dead bodies.\nZombies. Skeletons. Ghouls. Even more Crypt Lords and Wights. The undead had reappeared, and they had cut the adventurers off from escape. They fell upon the adventurers silently, grabbing them, biting them, pushing them back towards Skinner.\n“Retreat!”\nCalruz bellowed as he gripped his battleaxe in shaking hands and decapitated a zombie. Ceria moved. She raised her wand slowly and fired a spike of ice at one of the dead as her feet took her backwards.\nShe could move. She and Gerial ran back down the corridor with the other adventurers, knocking away the undead. She could fight. But the instant she turned towards Skinner or even thought of raising her wand to fight him—\nParalysis. Fear. She couldn’t. She couldn’t. All she could do was run. She had to get away. She had to get\naway.\nThe adventurers screamed and ran down the corridor, some tripping, some fighting with the undead or dragged backwards. Skinner seized a mage who screamed for help, but no one turned for him.\nThey ran. But they stopped when they saw the wall of undead warriors blocking the way back up to the surface. They waited, the dead body of the warrior who had fled earlier crushed against one wall, his brains pasted on the stone.\n“We must run.”\n“We must fight.”\nYvlon and Calruz spoke at the same time. She was trembling, but he had stopped. His head was turned. He was looking back towards Skinner.\nCeria didn’t want to look. She wanted to run, but Calruz had stopped. He raised his voice, not shouting, but speaking loudly, his voice echoing in the silence.\n“Horns of Hammerad. If you have any pride, turn and face your enemy.”\nShe didn’t want to. But she had to. Just to know how close it was. Ceria turned—\nAnd saw Sostrom.\nHe dangled from Skinner’s hands. Or part of him did. His skin had been taken and had become part of Skinner’s body. The monster cast aside what remained.\nHe had screamed for help. But Ceria had ignored him. He had screamed for help. And now he was dead.\nCeria saw it. She saw it, but her eyes fled from Skinner. She shook, unable to look at him. He was advancing slowly, taking his time as the undead boxed the other adventurers in. She—Sostrom was dead. But she had to run.\nHer feet moved back. But a pair of huge boots stomped forwards.\nCalruz took one step and then two. He moved haltingly—his body leaning forwards as if he were struggling against something. But he moved towards Skinner, and he spoke.\n“Do not run. You are the Horns of Hammerad. This thing has slain our own. We must avenge—”\n“Calruz. We have to go. Help us.”\nCeria breathed the words. The Minotaur shook his head.\n“Honor. We must not run. Face your death with pride.”\nHe hefted his battleaxe. Skinner paused, staring down the corridor at the only adventurer not running from him. He seemed…intrigued, as far as his expressionless face could be. He raised a hand.\n“I am Calruz of the Beriad. I challenge you.”\nThe Minotaur raised his axe. He dodged under one of Skinner’s hands as it shot towards him and raced towards the body. He brought his weapon up and sliced at Skinner’s chest.\nThe battleaxe bit deep into flesh. Calruz roared as he tore it through the dead skin, and for a moment, Ceria dared hope. The adventurers paused in their fighting, and so did the dead, staring at Skinner.\nCalruz severed the chunk of Skinner he’d carved away, and it fell to the ground. Skinner blinked down at it. It was—\nIt was dead skin. Calruz stared into the gaping wound he’d left. Dead skin was all he saw. Just dead skin. No blood. Not even any organs or bones. Just dead skin, layered to create armor.\nHow deep did it run?\nSkinner was so\nvast—\nHe raised his axe again, and it bit deep. But he struck nothing but skin. And above him, the monster moved.\nA massive hand swung towards Calruz. The Minotaur had lodged his axe in the skin, and he had to roll and abandon it. He dodged sideways, but too slowly. Too late.\nSkinner turned and seized Calruz’s arm with one of its hands. It\ntwisted\n, and the Minotaur screamed and fell back. The monster tossed his arm to the ground dismissively, and his mouth moved. The layers of flesh wrinkled up, and that vacant mouth twisted at the corners.\nSkinner grinned.\nCeria screamed as Calruz stumbled away, one of his shoulders suddenly a bleeding stump. He roared in pain, fury, and fear. He raised his hand to strike at Skinner, but something caught him from behind.\nA zombie. The dead Drake grabbed Calruz by the legs. He turned and kicked, and it fell to the ground, skull fractured. But a skeleton tackled him, grabbing onto his arm, and then more zombies seized him. Calruz threw them aside, pounding, fighting, but they engulfed him.\nHe disappeared under a swarm of bodies, roaring in agony as their claws and blades tore at his flesh. The darkness swallowed the Minotaur as Skinner turned towards Ceria.\nShe trembled. She was fixed in place as the crimson eyes fixed on her. She wanted to run. She\nneeded\nto run. But fear kept her in place.\nA skeleton drew near, grinning, a sword in its hands. It raised the blade, and Gerial slammed into the skeleton, knocking it to the floor.\n“Ceria!”\nHe shouted at her, shielding her with his back from Skinner’s gaze. She could suddenly move again, and she gasped and shuddered as he pushed her back.\nGerial held Ceria as she clutched at him, his head swiveling around at the dead fighting the living, the adventurers still screaming and trying to escape. His arms tightened, and he held her close. He spoke to her, his voice the only thing she could hear above the roaring in her ears.\n“Go. Run.”\n“What?”\nCeria stared at him. Gerial’s face was white, and he looked almost as bloodless as Skinner’s body. He shuddered, and she felt it.\n“Run. I’ll—I’ll buy you some time.”\nHe pointed down the corridor. Ceria’s feet began to move, but she halted them.\n“Gerial—”\nHe shoved her away.\n“\nRun,\ndamn you!”\nHe turned and walked down the corridor towards Skinner. He couldn’t look at it, and his legs shook. They stopped fifteen feet from Skinner. Gerial couldn’t move any closer.\nAgain, Skinner halted and stared at him with interest. Gerial tried to raise his sword, but he couldn’t. Terror gripped him, and he couldn’t even lift his weapon.\nIt wasn’t fair. But he heard and felt Ceria turn and flee behind him. That was enough. That was—\nHe raised the other object in his right hand. A jar of acid sloshed around in his gauntleted hand. Maybe. If he could get Skinner to turn back, maybe—\nHe was going to die. Gerial knew it. The undead surrounded him, not attacking. The adventurers were running or dead, but the dead waited for Skinner to take him. He had to buy time. To let her live. To let one of them survive.\n“Death before dishonor.”\nThe words were enough to make him look up, to meet that terrifying gaze. Skinner smiled at him, and Gerial’s heart stopped. The hand came down, and he raised his arm, drew it back to throw the jar.\nBut he hesitated. The fear made his arm spasm, and the jar of acid broke on the ground in front of Skinner, showering only the monster’s lower half with acid.\nSkinner lurched back. The skin began to smoke and peel away, but the creature didn’t let the acid consume any more. He reached down and peeled off several layers of his own body, digging his hand into the white skin and hurling the smoking bits to the ground where they were consumed.\nFool. If he’d only thrown it better. If—\nThe acid was fading. Even if he’d had another jar, even if his aim had been true…\nGerial stared numbly at the dead flesh. He raised his sword, but Skinner lashed out with one finger, and the weapon went flying. Gerial’s hand broke with the impact. He felt the pain, a dull shock running through him, but it was just a feeling.\nThe man reached for his belt dagger with his other hand, but the darkness was closing in and—\nA pale wall of glistening flesh rose.\nHigher and higher. Two eyes deeper red than blood looked down at him. Gerial looked up bitterly. Skinner loomed over him. It was no longer smiling, at least.\nCeria. Had she run? Had she made it?\nWhy here?\nThe man spoke, his voice breaking, laden with guilt and regret. With fear. Yet here he stood.\n“If—”\nA hand seized him, and Gerial felt\ntearing—\nand then coldness.\nHe was gone before he hit the floor.",

    "text": "Ceria saw Gerial die. She stopped in the corridor and screamed. He fell to the ground as Skinner carefully took his skin. The creature placed it where acid had struck him and then continued on as if nothing had happened.\nShe had to run. But something in Ceria was screaming louder than the fear. Sostrom. Calruz. Gerial. Her friends were dead. Her family was dying.\nShe faced Skinner, her body shaking. Ceria couldn’t even stare into his face. He laughed at her, soundlessly, crumbling lips revealing a body that was hollow. He was just skin. Skin and something red that twisted through the dead body, giving it life.\nShe couldn’t raise her wand. Fear consumed every part of her. Ceria howled in despair and fled. It was the only thing she could do. She left her friend behind and ran.\nLive. She would die if she faced Skinner. She had to live.\nA hand shot out and seized her by the leg. Ceria screamed as the skin along the back of her leg\ntore\n.\nHer skin curled as Skinner regarded it in one hand. He brought it up to his ‘mouth’ as if tasting it and then tossed the bit of flesh away. And he took no notice of Ceria either. Skinner turned and began to drag himself along the ground, after the Humans.\nFor a moment, Ceria lay on the ground, disbelieving. But then she saw the dead moving towards her, and reality came back with the pain.\nShe got up. Her leg—she could move. But only just. Ceria limped and pulled herself along the corridor. The undead were around her, striking at adventurers as they cowered or chasing those that fled.\nIt was chaos. Ceria raised her wand and blasted a skeleton out of her path. She was close to the room with the injured but—\nYvlon was ahead of her, part of the scrum of adventurers screaming and fighting to get past two Crypt Lords. The massive abominations blocked the passage, smashing adventurers against the walls and crushing them with contemptuous ease.\nThere was no attempt to fight as a group. Men and women shoved each other, striking even their friends as they sought to escape. Skinner slowly dragged himself down the corridor, ripping the Humans apart as they screamed in terror.\nThe Captain of the Silver Spears was shouting, trying to be heard above the din. She was gripped by terror like the others, but she was at least coherent enough to try and fight the Crypt Lords. But no one was listening to her.\nThe undead were everywhere. They flooded out of the tunnels, biting, clawing,\ntearing.\nCeria screamed as a skeleton stabbed her in the back with a dagger. Again, her robes saved her, but she felt the skin break even as the blade slashed at her.\nIt stabbed her in the leg. Ceria screamed as she felt her exposed sinews\ntear\nand her bones\ncrack.\nShe raised her wand and this time burned it. The skeleton staggered away as its bones cracked from the heat. Ceria pulled herself upright. The pain was overwhelming, but if she stopped to consider it, she would die.\nThe Crypt Lords barred the way, but there were gaps between their bloated bodies. Enough for her to get through. She could run. She could use the other adventurers as a shield so long as Skinner ignored her. If Ceria sacrificed them, she could—\nYvlon was fighting. Her blonde hair was dirty with blood, but she whirled, cutting down Ghouls and zombies as she struggled to protect her friends. She was trying to carve a path open before Skinner reached them. But the Crypt Lords were too strong, the adventurers too disorganized.\nThey would all die. Ceria looked at Skinner, and her mouth opened. She couldn’t raise her wand despite it all. The magic was too strong. She was too afraid. She cursed herself for that.\nBut the others—Gerial’s face swam in front of Ceria. She closed her eyes.\n“Death before dishonor.”\nCeria snapped her wand. She had to break it over her good knee, but when she did, the magic burst out. Cold, endless cold instantly covered the walls and floor around her with frost, and the undead trying to attack her froze. But Ceria took the magic and used it.\nA spell.\nYvlon turned, her sword raised just in time to see Ceria point. The half-Elf was standing down the corridor,\nbehind\nSkinner, but she aimed at the Crypt Lord closest to Yvlon. Her finger glowed with white-blue light, and a blizzard had appeared around her.\nThe female adventurer dove to the floor as a spike of ice twice as long and wide as a Human fired down the passage. It struck the Crypt Lord in the chest and continued down the passage, shattering into shards against a wall. The undead, and even adventurers unlucky enough to be caught in the way, fell to the ground, frozen. Or dead.\nThe lower half of the Crypt Lord fell down, and adventurers scrambled through the opening. The other Crypt Lord seized two men, but other adventurers darted past, pursued by the faster undead.\nCeria nearly blacked out as the magical backlash struck her. She would have screamed, but the pain was just one more layer in her agony. But the coldness she had channeled struck her as well. The hand she had used for the spell was already numb, but now she could no longer move it.\nHer hand froze. Her skin began to peel away and turned black in places. She fell to her knees as Yvlon turned.\nFifteen feet. An eternity of space. That was what separated the two. But the dead were running, and Skinner followed, snatching lives away. Yvlon wavered for a second, and her eyes met Ceria’s.\nTheir gazes met for a long second, and then the Captain of the Silver Spears tore herself away. She kept running, and the dead surged after her.\nMost of them. Skinner ignored the half-Elf, but others were drawn to her. She got to her feet and began to run as a few undead broke off to chase her.\nDown the hallway, to the right. Through the maze of corridors she’d explored. Ceria ran, dodging flailing arms and gaping jaws, knowing there was no escape.\nShe tripped and fell down as she reached the place where she had read Skinner’s message. Ceria tried to get up and realized she hadn’t tripped. Her broken leg had stopped moving.\nThis was it. She scrambled to get up, pushing at the ground with her one good arm and leg. She leaned against one wall, feeling something important draining from her.\nA shape appeared out of the darkness. A Ghoul bounded down the corridor, glowing yellow eyes fixed on Ceria. It had been female, once. It stared at Ceria, grinning with jagged teeth.\nCeria drew her dagger. It was heavy in her shaking right hand.\nThe Ghoul drew closer, feinting, dodging around Ceria to get at her back. She staggered, trying to keep it in front of her.\nCeria felt hollow. Empty. She was crying. She was sobbing. She wished—\nShe wished it hadn’t happened. Any of it. But it was too late now.\nThe Ghoul slashed at her, drawing blood, dodging back. It was about to go for the kill.\nTears fell from her eyes, but Ceria blinked them away. She lunged, and her dagger caught the Ghoul in the cheek. It thrashed, ripping her blade out of her hand, and then its teeth were biting, tearing at her ear, her flesh.\nCeria reached out her hand, but there was no one to take it.\nCold.\nCalruz. Gerial. Had they done anything? She wished she had stayed with them. Too late, now.\nCeria closed her eyes and waited for the end. It came with sharp teeth to take her away from the pain. And then she was gone.",

    "text": "Erin sat in her inn, staring at the table. She didn’t have anything better to do. Normally, she served customers, chatted, or played chess, but she couldn’t today.\nThey were all gone. Pawn had left for the city with the other Workers, promising to come back tomorrow.\nHe—still couldn’t move right. But the other Workers helped him walk and move and—\n“Something’s different about him.”\nToren looked up from his table at Erin. He paused, waiting for an instruction, and then went back to scrubbing.\n“I mean, he seems different. He\nacts\ndifferent. More confident, y’know?”\nToren carefully picked up a small beetle that had wandered into the building and squished it between his fingers.\n“\nEw!\nDon’t\ndo\nthat! Just get rid of them outside!”\nObediently, the skeleton walked out the door. Erin tried not to let her stomach remember the sight of the orange insides of the insect oozing—\n“Not many bugs around. But it’s winter. Apparently.”\nIt wasn’t very cold. Toren opened the door and walked back in, fingers clean, but Erin barely shivered.\n“Am I near the equator?”\nThe skeleton shrugged at her. At least that was something. He generally didn’t respond to questions aimed at him, but he was far more useful than he had been.\nErin leaned over the table. She had no one else to talk to, and at least Toren looked confused when she spoke, which was better than nothing.\n“It was the chess. Pawn was totally on the offense this morning! Did you notice that? He was better—I mean, he’s still learning, but he’s taking chances. I can’t wait to see what happens if he and Rags play a game. It’s like he had a massive confidence boost or something. Do you think it was what happened with Ksmvr?”\nToren stared at Erin and then picked up the rag and dipped it into the bucket. Erin sighed. She leaned back in her chair, wondering how much it would hurt if she fell over. It would hurt more if Toren dove to catch her like he had twice before. Landing on floorboards?\nOuch.\nLanding on bony skeleton bits?\nDouble ouch.\nErin closed her eyes, and then her eyes opened wide. She lost her balance and tipped forwards, smacking her face on the table. But she didn’t even process that.\nAn alarm. It sounded—no, it\nfelt\nlike a tornado warning siren blasting in her head at full volume. But that wasn’t\nsound\n, it was the feeling, a high-pitched whine that told her she was in\ndanger\n.\nErin looked around. Toren stared at her, holding the dripping rag in one hand. Erin knocked her chair over as she ran into the kitchen and grabbed the frying pan and a jar of acid. Toren looked up and dropped the rag when he saw Erin was armed.\n“Something’s out there.”\nHe immediately dashed into the kitchen and came out with the sword he’d taken from one of the adventurers Erin had kicked out of her inn. Erin knelt next to one of the tables, heart beating out of her chest. The alarm was still going off in her head, and she felt\nscared\n.\nToren was behind her. He lifted the sword as he peered around the inn. He stared at Erin expectantly and pointed to the door.\n“I don’t know where it is. But there’s something. Something bad.”\nIt didn’t\nsound\nlike something was outside. Erin opened the door cautiously and peered out. She gestured, and Toren ran upstairs and returned in a few moments, shaking his head. She looked out her windows and then threw caution to the wind.\nShe ran outside, standing at the top of the hill, staring around at the grasslands. The sun was setting on those colorful swathes of grass, and the looming mountains cast long, ominous shadows. At night, soon, only the distant city would be a glowing dot on the horizon if you knew where to look. Erin’s eyes roamed for something—anything—spiders, Rock Crabs, moving in the long grass valleys and hills.\nBut she saw nothing. She ran around the other side of the inn and stared in the other direction. Then she had Toren boost her up and stared from the top of the roof.\nAfter a while, Erin jumped down, and Toren collapsed as he tried to catch her.\n“\nOw!\nGet out of the way next time!”\nHe helped her up, and Erin stared around the empty grasslands. Nothing. The sun was still lowering in the sky, and it wasn’t even night yet. She couldn’t\nsee\nanything. But she had felt it, with a certainty that didn’t go away.\n“What was that, then?”\nFor ten more minutes, Erin walked around, listening hard, eyes scanning the horizon. But she couldn’t see anything. And being out in the open was starting to bother her more than anything else.\nPerhaps—perhaps it was a false alarm? Or whatever was happening was far away. Like…\n“Maybe someone dropped a nuke? Or a magical nuke?”\nErin shook her head as Toren stared at her. No good.\n“It might be nothing. Just—keep an eye out, okay?”\nHe nodded. Erin sighed and shook her head. She went back into her inn. But she kept the frying pan, the jar of acid, and one of the kitchen knives on the table.\nJust in case.",

    "text": "Miles northwest of the inn, the dead poured out of the ruins on the hillside. They were howling—screaming through broken lungs, shrieking with voices no mortal, living creature could make. They ran through the grass, the evening sun at their backs. Zombies charged towards the city, arms outstretched, eyes glowing as they hunted for the living.\nGhouls bounded past them, leaping ten feet at a time, while massive Crypt Lords lumbered behind them, trampling lesser undead under their bodies. All of them—pale Wights, skeletons marching in ranks—moved with one purpose. To the city. To find the living.\nTo add them to their ranks.\nThe small shantytown that had sprung up around the ruins was gone. Broken timber and dead bodies were all that remained of the adventurers and merchants that had lived there. They had been cut down trying to flee in the first few minutes of the attack.\nSo many dead. The [Guard] unit had lasted ten seconds, maybe more. Brave Drakes and Gnolls had tried to hold ranks at the entrance of the tunnel—then realized the undead had no end.\nIt wasn’t hundreds, it was thousands.\nAnd they moved so\nfast—\nzombies should not run like that, not\nsprint.\nThis wasn’t just a horde of random undead monsters that had come together, or even a group under the control of a Lich or Crypt Lord. This was an invasion led by a single creature.\nSkinner dragged itself across the earth, preternaturally fast. So quick it outpaced the Crypt Lords, arms churning through the dirt. It moved its grotesque body at the speed a horse could run.\nImpossible.\nBut each arm was so\nstrong\nit churned up the soil—and its eyes glowed red. A crimson glow that made every undead it gazed upon move even faster.\nLiscor had seen the camp-lights around the ruins go dark. Even before Skinner appeared, they had heard the screams. The [Guards] knew what to do, and their task was simple.\nClose the gates.\nLiscor’s were solid metal, impenetrable to even the smallest gnats. They were poised to close them—until someone shouted.\n“\nSurvivors! They’re coming! Hold the gates!\nHold the gates!”\nDesperate people were running ahead of the monsters, screaming, begging for entry. The Watch Sergeant on duty froze. The right thing to do was close the gates—but they could slam shut the steel doors in a moment.\n“\nHold the doors!\n”\nA woman in silver armor collapsed as she ran through with the surviving [Guards], adventurers, and a dozen other people who’d outrun the horde. A Drake raced over to her and recoiled.\nHer face—\n“Get them to safety! Gates down!\nMove, move!\nCall the Watch Captain! Summon Klbkch—summon the Prognugator! Where’s Olesm? Raise the alarm!”\nThe Watch Sergeant shouted as the bells began to ring. The city was coming alive, and people in the streets looked up and began to ask what was happening. He waited for the gates to close—and after fifteen beats of his heart, realized something was wrong.\n“\nClose the gates! Close—\n”\nThe Drake ran down the wall and then saw a crimson light glowing in the distance. He stumbled to a halt, fell to his knees—and froze there, trembling.\nThe gates!\nHe knew they were open. Heard the undead drawing nearer, but something froze him. Froze the [Guards]—locked their trembling hands into place. It came from that thing, that malformed piece of flesh with staring gemstone eyes.\nMagic—the Watch Sergeant saw his arms spasming wildly as he tried to move. And he couldn’t. Something was freezing his muscles.\n[Terror]. A spell. He looked up and whispered.\n“C-close…the…”\nThe gates had begun to move downwards when the undead first appeared, ready to slam. But they halted as the guards manning the gates suddenly threw down their weapons and ran, screaming. The Watch Sergeant tried to fight the pure fear welling up in his chest—and then his body took over. He ran.\nAnd the gates to Liscor lay open.\nSkinner pointed a thousand undead towards the gates, and they surged towards it. Then the screaming grew louder. The walls of Liscor could have held an army at bay. But without the gates—",

    "text": "Was it smiling? Did it smile? Was it…alive? Did it think?\nIt surely did. The thing was moving the undead around like some kind of Chieftain. As if it knew how to fight.\nSee? Zombies in front, Ghouls leaping in packs along the side. It put the skeletons in ranks behind the first undead, Crypt Lords interspersed in vanguards. It even made those with bows stand and advance in the rear-guard, around it.\nSomeone was watching the undead pouring towards Liscor. And as if Skinner realized it was being watched, it turned slightly away from the Watch fleeing the walls in fear.\nSkinner’s eyes shifted away from the gates, and Rags ducked down and pulled the Goblin next to her into the grass. She and her followers flattened themselves into the earth, making themselves as small as possible.\nFear touched them, making their hearts pound wildly. It was a familiar thing. The Goblins peeked out of the grass while Rags whisper-shouted insults at them and made them keep their heads down.\nOnly after a few minutes did they dare look again. Far below, the creature known as Skinner had focused its attention back on the city. The undead were already through the gates, and they could hear screaming even from this distance.\nFrom their hilltop, the group of armed Goblins watched the carnage. Rags touched the sheathed short sword at her side, but only to make sure it was there. She had no intention of moving from this spot.\nSkinner was moving slowly, now. He paused at the open gates in a throng of undead, guarding his safety. The northern gates were engulfed in fighting, but Skinner was flanking, sending more undead to the east to flood in through two points. This control of the undead was being done from the back ranks, Skinner out of range of most arrows and spells. But he was the most dangerous thing down there by far, Rags was sure.\nShe saw the twisted, grotesque thing made of dead flesh twist its head towards her again and immediately crouched to hide in the grass. The Goblins around her shivered and held their weapons more firmly. Rags shook her head as she watched Skinner slowly drag itself towards the city.\nIt was intelligent. And it was deadly. She knew it in her bones. But more deadly than the city full of Drakes and Gnolls?\nThere were many, many people in the city. She had once tried to guess with her sticks. If ten blades of grass was a stick, and ten sticks became a rock…\nA rock was a hundred. A number Pisces had taught her. Then ten rocks became…a chess piece. A thousand.\nThere would be a hundred chess pieces’ worth of people in the city.\nA hundred thousand.\nBut some were small like Rags, and some didn’t have weapons. Skinner had just led thirty-six chess pieces’ worth of monsters into the city.\nThirty-six thousand monsters, each one moving like pieces under its will. And there were no walls and a lot of bodies for it to add to its forces.\nThen Rags understood. Each dead Drake was another blade of grass for Skinner’s forces. Each Gnoll…a new zombie. She sat on the hill and watched as death poured into Liscor. Watching. Waiting.\nCalculating.\nAfter a few minutes, her belly rumbled.",

All Goblins needed was a fork, and that was only because Erin insisted.\nShe’d cooked a fine meal of pasta and sausage, or perhaps it was sausage and pasta. Goblins liked meat, so she’d made the pot mostly that with some spiral noodles thrown in just to add color.\nErin hesitated. The food was warm, but she didn’t want to eat alone—or with Toren as the case may be. She could wait. Besides, Rags and her crew\nnever\nmissed a meal. They were probably running from Rock Crabs or attacking helpless travellers. She should really talk to them about that.\nStill. Erin glanced towards the window. It would be night in an hour or less. And the Goblins quite sensibly hated travelling at night.\n“Do you think she forgot?”\nToren shrugged. He raised his head and stared in the direction of Liscor. He felt…something. A voice? A calling. But it was faint. He shrugged and continued setting the table. But Erin’s earlier warning…the skeleton looked up, and he felt the\ntug\nin the distance.\nThat decided him. The skeleton picked up a fork and eyed the tines, wishing they were sharper. Erin was right.\nSomething was out there.",

    "text": "“\nClose the gates!\n”\nThe streets of Liscor were filled with the dead. Civilians screamed and fled or barricaded themselves in their homes as zombies, skeletons, and other lurching forms ran through the streets. But the undead ran up against a wall of blades before they made it far down the streets.\nThe City Watch stood shoulder-to-shoulder, firing arrows into the crowd while armed Gnolls and Drakes held the front ranks back. The Captain of the Watch, the tall Drake named Zevara, shouted up towards the walls as she cut down another zombie.\n“\nWhere the hell are the other guards?\nWhy aren’t those gates closing?”\nShe bellowed as she chopped down on a skeleton’s arm, severing the bones. The guardsmen in front of her closed ranks and threw the undead back. A Gnoll ran towards Zevara, and she turned towards him.\n“Tkrn. What’s happening out there?”\nHe grinned desperately, the fur on his chest matted with blood and gore.\n“Fighting, Captain. We’ve closed off the streets like you said. That’s stopping them, but there are larger creatures out there.”\n“Crypt Lords. They’re extremely dangerous. Shoot them down if you can. But what about the southern gates? If they’ve fallen—”\nTkrn shook his head, and Zevara shielded her face as bits of flesh flew everywhere.\n“Sorry, Captain. The southern gates are closed, and we’ve got [Archers] shooting down any undead that try to climb up. But all our guards on the north and eastern walls have fled!”\n“That doesn’t make sense. I\nsaw\nthose gates closing! What could have…?”\nA zombie shoved aside a Drake and lunged for Zevara, jaw gaping wide. She stepped back, and Tkrn’s hand axe buried itself in its exposed brain.\n“Close ranks!”\nZevara’s voice cracked like a whip, and the guards around her flinched. She pointed, and more warriors ran forwards to fill in the weak spot in the line. Not all of the Watch was fighting. Zevara had kept several groups back, spread around the city to fill in weak spots.\nNow she raised her voice as more undead ran down the streets and hit the ranks of armed warriors hard.\n“Are you Human cowards or\nguardsmen?\nPut your tails into it!”\nThe Drakes and Gnolls heard her and answered with a roar. They pushed the undead back several feet, and Zevara turned back to Tkrn as he wiped the hand axe on his fur.\n“What else?”\nHis face was pale under his fur, but the younger [Guard] pointed back the way he’d come.\n“The adventurers are asking what they can do. They’re fighting with our people—but poorly. There aren’t many good teams around. My people have bows. They’re shooting from the rooftops!”\n“Have them pick off any stragglers that break through. We’ll hold the line here and push forwards. Now, where’s Relc?”\n“He’s holding them off down Tesseract Street.”\nZevara grunted.\n“Good. They won’t get through that way, then. But this is\ninsane\n.”\nShe pointed to the massive gates, visible from where she and Tkrn stood.\n“We shouldn’t be fighting in the streets! If we can get close to those gates and close them, these undead will die outside the city. Why the hell are they still\nopen?\n”\nSomeone else growled.\n“Many of those large things are standing next to the entrance. We cannot kill them, and more keep coming.”\n“Crypt Lords standing guard? That’s…”\nZevara trailed off. She glanced at the undead, and suddenly, a cold bit of fear wormed its way into her heart. She had a thought.\n“The Necromancer?”\nTkrn raised his axe.\n“I saw him in the city earlier today. I could track and kill him—”\n“Not that idiot. I mean the\nNecromancer.\n”\n“Oh.”\nTkrn looked worried. Zevara shook her head.\n“If it was him, we’d be dead already. There aren’t any Giants or Bone Horrors or Ghosts or any of the other undead he brought last time. No—this is something else.”\nShe pointed down the street.\n“This area is secure. I’ve got civilians holding bows, and a few mages are catching any Crypt Lords they see. You go and organize the adventurers. Tell Relc I want to see him, and find Olesm! We need his Skills!”\n“No one has seen him this day. They saw him leaving the city, but—”\n“If he’s here,\nfind him!\nI’ve got to go. The east streets need help.”\nTkrn nodded and loped off. Zevara exchanged a few curt words with a large Drake sergeant and ran through the streets.\nThe undead had caught the city by surprise, but the city militia wasn’t like a Human one. Nor were the citizens. The undead had overrun the first few streets, but their momentum had halted once the Watch and groups of combat-capable citizens had formed barricades and halted their advance.\nThe problem was that the undead weren’t sticking to the streets. They went through houses, over rooftops—attacking the beleaguered defenders from behind. They were hunted down, but it added another layer of complexity to Zevara’s nightmare.\nAnd the eastern streets were furthest from the guardsmen’s barracks. They needed reinforcements or else—\nZevara ran out of the alleyway just in time to see a Crypt Lord smash its way into a group of guardsmen and civilians, sending them flying. The bloated Drake’s corpse was immediately attacked from all sides and pushed back by a pillar of stone, but while everyone was concentrated on it, a pack of zombies ran past the line and towards the civilian archers.\nThe fifteen or so Drakes and Gnolls froze up in fear with one exception. Krshia calmly took down one zombie, shooting an arrow through its eye. She drew a wickedly long dagger and grabbed a second zombie while Zevara crashed into two more.\nThe last zombie ran past the two and opened up a male Drake’s scales with a devastating strike. He had a piece of sword buried in his hand, making all of his wild swings deadly.\nThe Drake fell down, screaming, and his companion backed away in horror. Selys raised her bow, but the zombie split it in two with a single blow. She screamed for help, but the corpse of the Gnoll ran at her, mouth opened wide to bite.\nShe raised her claws—but she wasn’t her Uncle.\nShe hadn’t had time to get to her apartment and grab her steel fighting claws he’d given her.\nSword it was. Selys pivoted, dodged the bite, and slashed with her claws, but it was a\nzombie\nand barely noticed the raking cuts.\nSword! She needed the sword!\nSelys dodged sideways for it, and the zombie whirled. It\nleapt,\nand the sword stabbed into its leg as Selys fell back.\nZombies didn’t do this! This was the work of some kind of advanced death magic. It was like every zombie was a Ghoul.\nShe tried to wrench the sword free as its teeth touched her throat—\n“Begone,\npest.\n”\nSelys screamed in horror as the zombie’s neck suddenly twisted around. The undead Gnoll collapsed to the ground, twitching.\n“Just so we’re clear:\nI\ndidn’t raise them.”\nPisces appeared out of the air next to Selys and Zevara, hands glowing with purple energy. Selys gaped at him, scales nearly white.\n“You!”\n“Ah. Hello to you, receptionist. Don’t wait to thank me for saving your life.”\nPisces gave Selys a mocking bow and then turned. He pointed, and two more zombies and a skeleton fell to the ground, necks broken.\nKrshia bared her teeth as she hammered her zombie’s head into the cobblestones, breaking its bones until what she held wasn’t so much a head as bits of one.\nShe stood up as Zevara beheaded her opponent. The Drake turned to Pisces as Selys backed away from him. He raised his hands protectively, and a wall of wind swirled around him.\n“I mean you no harm. And this wasn’t my fault! I was in the city all day, and I knew nothing of this—this event.”\nThe Drake eyed him. She shook her head and shouted to the guardsmen as they wavered, trying to form their line.\nAnother group of eight armed Drakes ran into the street. They rushed into battle with a roar as Pisces pointed, and another zombie that had gotten past fell down, dead.\n“Believe me, ah, Captain. I would never jeopardize my good standing with your city. In fact, I am helping to prove my innocence. I—”\n“I believe you.”\nPisces blinked. So did Selys. Krshia was firing into the crowd of the dead already.\n“We have countless witnesses who saw the undead emerge from the ruins. Besides, I doubt a [Necromancer] of your level could reanimate more than five bodies, let alone a horde like this.”\nPisces scowled.\n“I—”\nHe hesitated and glanced at Zevara.\n“Um, that is correct. But this is rather inconvenient, is it not?”\nShe glared at him.\n“Are all you Humans as damn crazy as this? Liscor is\nunder attack!\n”\nHe shrugged.\n“They’re just the undead. Quite easy to subdue. I have every confidence your Watch will safeguard innocent civilians like myself.”\nHe turned.\n“If you’ll excuse me—”\n“Oh, no you don’t!”\nSelys stomped on the hem of Pisces’ robe, and the mage stumbled. His arms wind milled frantically as he tried to keep his balance. He turned and glared at Selys, but she advanced on him, tail thrashing.\n“You stay here and help! If this wasn’t your fault, then help us!”\nPisces hesitated. Zevara hesitated. She didn’t like the mage, but she needed all the help she could get.\n“Can you do that back-snapping thing many times?”\nHe sniffed and clicked his fingers. Three skeletons fell down like dolls that had their strings cut.\n“It’s\nneck\nsnapping, and I have ample mana reserve. I suppose if it means exonerating myself…”\n“Good. Do it!”\nThe Crypt Lord finally fell to the ground, splashing those nearby with toxic blood. Zevara cursed as those hit cried out and retreated to be cured. She ran towards the line of guardsmen, already shouting. Selys stared at Pisces, finger raised. He raised his hands.\n“I understand. I will help. Stay here and, ah, try not to put an arrow in my back.”\nShe spluttered, but Pisces was already striding forwards. He kept a safe distance between the struggling fighters and the dead as he stared at the masses of the undead running through the streets.\n“I assume I will be remunerated appropriately for this?”\nZevara turned her head and snarled at Pisces.\n“Kill these things and I’ll give you a medal. Now start casting or I’ll slice your damn hands off!”\nPisces sniffed and conjured a flaming sphere into existence. He aimed it at a crowd of the dead as they surged down the street.\n“I prefer gold, myself.”\nHe threw the orb, and fire consumed the dead bodies. The [Necromancer] smirked as the undead screamed. Fast or not, the zombies and Ghouls were still slow targets to him. He snapped the neck of a Ghoul leaping to one side, casually, bringing it down.\nBut who was making them so quick? A foreign [Necromancer]?\nWhat…\nWhat had happened to Ceria?\nPisces stared towards the gates, and his smile winked out. Then—he heard the Watch Captain scream in the distance.\n“\nFall back! Fall back to Tesseract street!\n”\nWhyever would she do that? They were holding fine with him here! Pisces turned to tell her they were losing a decent defensive spot—when he whirled around.\n“[Fire Orb]!”\nHe shot a second spell into the dark street—then snapped his fingers. A neck\ntwisted—and the flaming orb went out before it could strike its target.\nBut the undead refused to go down. And Pisces couldn’t snap the neck of the too-pale Drake with huge fangs and long, grasping limbs that looked melted.\n“W-Wight?”\nHis voice trembled. Pisces backed up. But that was a rare undead! Then he saw a Crypt Lord appear. His fingers snapped.\nThe neck—\ntwitched.\nAnd did nothing more. Pisces stumbled back as the Wight ran forwards. Then he saw the second Crypt Lord appearing, and eight Ghouls bounded down. The [Necromancer] turned and ran.",

Why is it red over there? Is something burning?”\nToren walked over and saw the skies around Liscor were indeed glowing. And there was smoke, rising and barely visible in the moonlight.\nErin stared out the window worriedly. The pot of meat and noodles sat untouched on a table.

    "text": "A Ghoul caught a Drake’s halberd in one hand and punched him in the midsection with the other. The guardsmen gasped and collapsed as the Ghoul tossed aside the weapon and tried to race past the other guardsmen.\nZevara’s sword cut through the top of the Ghoul’s skull, severing the flesh and rotted brain. The Ghoul collapsed, and she helped the Drake to her feet.\n“Watch the damned Ghouls! They’re strong enough to rip your scales apart if you let them!”\nAnother zombie ran at them. Zevara turned her head and growled low in her throat. Then she took a deep breath and\nexhaled.\nA gout of fire leapt from her jaws and blasted the zombie off its feet. It fell to the ground, screaming and burning as Zevara coughed.\n“Where are the damned\nAntinium?\n”\nThe Watch had retreated back down another street, giving ground up as more undead flooded into the city. They were fighting well, and healing potions and a rain of arrows and magic had given them the advantage, but the undead\nkept coming.\nAnd the more dangerous ones had appeared. Wights, whose single touch would make you freeze up and fall over, helpless.\nCrypt Lords, who were so huge and tall they could sweep aside low-level [Warriors] in a single blow and break every bone in your body—or spit black poison.\nThe Watch was not equipped to deal with them. Or at least, they were well equipped, but they needed reinforcements. And those reinforcements were not coming.\nThe Watch was one half of the city’s defenses, but in truth, they only handled [Bandit] raids, criminals, the occasional monster pack, and so on. The landscape took care of most armies, but the other half of Liscor’s considerable defenses was the army.\nThe army…who were at Oteslia, leagues to the south! But even in their absence, there was another force, newer to Liscor, who could fight. The bargain that had made Liscor a pariah with every damn city in the south.\nThe Antinium.\nThe Black Tide who had nearly overrun Izril! An entire\nHive\nwas in Liscor, and they were the true force to be reckoned with along with the Watch.\nBut the Antinium, always present in some capacity in the city, were nowhere to be found. She hadn’t seen a single Worker today…or the last few days.\nZevara growled again and coughed out some smoke. She walked backwards as the Drake found his halberd and joined the line of guardsmen and shouted.\n“Tkrn! Where are you? Get over here!”\nThe Gnoll ran towards Zevara, panting. He was still drenched in gore, but now he was bleeding in places, dark blood covering his fur.\n“Here, Captain.”\n“Where are the Antinium? Send a message to the Queen at once! We need Soldiers!”\n“That will not be necessary, Captain Zevara. We are here.”\nZevara and Tkrn spun around. Ksmvr walked towards them, two swords and two daggers held at the ready. Fifteen Soldier Antinium followed him.\nKsmvr pointed towards the failing line of guards.\n“Join the battle. Kill all undead. Retreat if you suffer significant injuries.”\nThe Soldiers ran forwards instantly. They pushed aside the surprised Watch and civilians and crashed into the undead in a black wave of their own.\nA Ghoul lunged at the first of the Soldier Antinium. The huge ant man grabbed the undead and held its shoulders with two of his hands. The other two punched downwards.\nAs Erin had seen, the hands of the Soldiers were more like spades or weapons than actual digits. They pummeled the Ghoul, breaking bones, stabbing through flesh with ease. The Soldier held the Ghoul down, pounding it into paste. When it was done, it stood up and grabbed a zombie and ripped its head off.\nA skeleton stabbed the soldier Antinium in the back. It didn’t stagger as the blade buried and stuck in its carapace. It swung around and began ripping the skeleton apart.\nKsmvr watched the Soldiers fighting as the Drakes, Gnolls, and few Human adventurers staggered back, suddenly reprieved from battle. He nodded to Zevara as she stalked over to him.\n“Watch-Captain Zevara. It is good to see you alive.”\nZevara was in no mood to exchange pleasantries.\n“Where the hell\nwere\nyou? And where are the other Soldiers? I don’t need fifteen of them, I need every single one in your Hive! Bring them out!”\nKsmvr calmly replied to Zevara as he kept one eye on the battle.\n“As this is not a period of war or crises as declared by the Council, I must decline your request. The maximum number of soldiers the Watch Captain is allowed to command is fifty Soldier Antinium and a hundred Workers in a time of crisis.”\n“That is\nexactly\nwhat’s happening! Or do you not see the undead? I am authorizing you to bring\nall\nyour Hive! Bring the Soldiers and all the Workers then! We need barricades, fortifications—”\n“I regret to say that is impossible at the moment. I have brought fifteen Soldiers. That is all that can be spared at the moment.”\nZevara gaped at Ksmvr. She opened her mouth, and smoke plumed outwards as she shouted at him in fury.\n“\nWhy by the damned Ancestors\n—”\nAgain, Ksmvr cut Zevara off calmly.\n“The Soldiers guard the entrance to the Hive and the surrounding streets. We will let nothing disturb our Queen. She is in the middle of a critical process. The Rite of Anastases. She is hours—less perhaps—to completion.”\n“Your Queen can take her damned ritual or whatever it is and shove it—”\nZevara cut herself off as the blades in Ksmvr’s hands twitched. Half of the guardsmen near her raised their weapons, but their Captain waved them away. She eyed Ksmvr and tried to modulate her tone slightly.\n“This is a state of emergency. If we can’t push the undead back soon, they will overrun this place. Your Soldiers can buy us some time, but there’s not enough. We need all fifty and soon. More than that. We need all of them! Talk to your Queen. Tell her we need\nhelp!\n”\n“I regret that is impossible. The Queen must not be disturbed at this moment. I am sorry.”\nFlames trickled from Zevara’s mouth as she opened it in rage. Ksmvr held up one hand.\n“As soon as our Queen finishes the Rite of Anastases, we will fully cooperate in the defense of the city.”\nThere was no use arguing with the Antinium, so despite the building heat behind Zevara’s eyes, in her heart…and her lungs, she bit off her reply.\n“The Workers, then. We could use them. Not just for building. If they can fight—”\n“They are unable to be summoned as well.”\n“\nWhy?\n”\nFor the first time, Ksmvr visibly hesitated. He clicked his mandibles together and stared at the battle. Already, the Soldiers had pushed the undead back the street, and two were attacking a Crypt Lord as it spat black blood on them.\n“The Workers are in rebellion. Many have left the Hive and fought with the Soldiers at the entrance.”\nKsmvr lowered his voice as Zevara stared at him in horror.\n“Already, three have become Aberration. We fear the rest may have as well. They are violent, and many are armed.”\n“You’re serious.”\n“Very.”\nFor a moment, Zevara’s mind was caught up with images of Worker Antinium ripping apart Drakes and Gnolls. Then she brought herself back to reality and stared at the dead bodies lining the street. She snapped at Ksmvr.\n“If we didn’t have a horde of the undead trying to eat us all, I’d be more worried. The citizens are either in their homes or fighting with us. If these Workers kill a few zombies, I won’t shed any tears.”\nKsmvr shook his head.\n“I fear the Workers are not in the city any longer. They are moving towards a Human. Erin Solstice.”\n“The one who got Klbkch killed?”\n“Yes. One of the Aberrations who escaped was intent on killing her.”\nZevara didn’t have to think about this one. She gestured at the undead. The Crypt Lord was dead, but the two Soldier Antinium who had killed it were curled up, arms and legs withdrawn as they lay on the ground, dead of the poison.\n“Whatever the reason is, I can’t spare anyone. She’s not a citizen here, and we’re up to our necks in trouble. The Human will be on her own.”\nKsmvr nodded shortly.\n“The Queen is all. She must not be placed in danger. Erin Solstice…is merely important.”\nZevara eyed him. The words he’d just said—she couldn’t dwell on them now. She pointed towards the Soldier Antinium as she signaled the guardsmen to form up.\n“Will you stay and fight?”\nKsmvr nodded. He followed Zevara as she strode down the street, Drakes and Gnolls seizing weapons and standing to follow her.\n“I will fulfill my duty as Prognugator within Liscor. However, my position will cease in a few hours. Another will take my place.”\n“Until then, follow me. We’ve got to use this moment until your Soldiers all die.”\nTkrn fell into place next to Zevara, swearing, as the guardsmen and lone Antinium ran after the Soldier Antinium. Suddenly, things had gone from bad to worse. He looked around as the two realized—the relief they were waiting for wasn’t going to come.\nAnd the undead were pushing into the city.\nIf they tore into a group of civilians, a thousand—a thousand running, jumping, climbing zombies? Ten thousand?\nLiscor had a hundred thousand souls in it.\nThis was how undead apocalypses began. They had to hold the streets.\nAlone.\n“Anything I can do, Captain?”\nShe spat, so furious she trailed smoke.\n“You heard the Ant. Looks like we’ve got no choice. We\nneed\nto close those gates. Get Relc. He’s the only one who has a chance of cutting his way through. I’ll grab a squad and push up.”\nThe Gnoll nodded and broke away from the group. Zevara and the guardsmen rounded a corner and skidded to a stop. The Soldier Antinium had thrown back the undead, mercilessly cutting their way through them until they’d reached the main street down which the north gates were located. But there they had been stopped.\nZevara saw a Soldier borne down by the weight of a Crypt Lord and another hurling Ghouls to the ground as they swarmed him. She saw groups of guardsmen struggling to contain the main flow of undead. But that wasn’t what struck fear into her soul. She pointed towards the gates where something was dragging itself through the open stone doors.\nHer heart froze. The sword in her hands grew heavy, and around her, the Gnolls, Drakes, and Humans shuddered and felt terror coursing through their bodies. All around her, guardsmen and civilians fell back, screaming, unable to fight.\nZevara forced the words through her numb lips.\n“What is\nthat?\n”",

    "text": "It was nearly ten minutes before Erin managed to extricate herself from the bathroom and stagger back to the inn. She held her unhappy stomach and walked through the open door.\n“Toren?”\nThe inn was dark. Erin stared around. The skeleton normally came the instant she called. Where was he?\n“Hey, Toren. Where are you?”\nNo response. Erin didn’t hear the clicking of bones on floorboards. She stared around. He’d left the knife on the table. Had he gone out to fetch water?\nErin stared around the dark inn. He could at least have lit the lanterns. Or a candle. It was so dark—the only light came from the moon.\nWhere was he? And why—\nWhy was Erin feeling that same warning in her head again?\nShe spun around. Nothing. The grass shone in the moonlight from the open door. Erin relaxed. But then a prickling feeling ran down her spine.\nShe’d walked through the open door. But Toren always closed the door behind him. And if he hadn’t opened the door—\nWho had?\n“Hello?”\nErin backed up towards the door. Something moved in the shadows and shut it. She spun around, fists raised, and then relaxed.\n“Oh. Pawn. It’s just you.”\nThe Antinium stood in the doorway, nearly invisible in the light. Erin frowned. Then she took another step back.\n“Wait a second.”\nThe Antinium had four arms. And two legs. Pawn—Pawn didn’t have all his limbs anymore. But Workers weren’t allowed to leave the city unattended, and this Antinium didn’t have swords.\n“Who…are you?”\nHe was familiar. At least, he seemed familiar, but he definitely wasn’t Pawn or Ksmvr. The Worker—if that was what he was—shuddered. He shook slightly and then stepped suddenly towards Erin. She backed up quickly.\n“H-hello? Can you hear me? Who are you? What do you want?”\nThe Worker’s head twitched suddenly. Erin jerked back, and his voice came out, quivering with emotion.\n“i aM AnTiNium. i haVe a NaMe.”\nErin backed up even further. That wasn’t what a Worker normally sounded like. The one in front of her was speaking rapidly, his voice surging and falling. He sounded—\nInsane.\n“You have a name? Um. Good. That’s good, right?”\nHe stared at her.\n“I Am iNdivIDuAL. BuT i reJECT. I rejEcT aLL.”\n“Reject? Reject what?”\nHe pointed at her with two arms.\n“YOu. ThiS is yOuR FAulT.”\n“Me? What did I do?”\nThe Worker raised his hand, and a sword shone in the moonlight. He walked towards Erin, still speaking.\n“YOU DiD ThiS To me. yOu mAde Me THis waY. For yOU, I did tHis. bUT alL iS SuffERIng.”\nErin backed up, speaking fast. She tried to sense where her frying pan and jar of acid were, but it was impossible in the darkness.\n“What did I do? I don’t remember—”\n“yOU knoW.”\n“Please—”\nErin took another step back and suddenly tripped over a chair. She sprawled to the ground and desperately tried to get up. But the Worker was too fast. He loomed over her, sword raised.\nErin kicked up at his groin, but the Antinium caught her leg. He pinned her down with three arms and held the last one up with the tip of its sword pointed at her face. Erin tried to scream, to shout. But her breath was gone. She stared at the gleaming blade as the Worker shuddered and stared at her.\n“diE.”\nThe sword flashed towards her eye. Erin screamed—\nAnd another Antinium seized the first and threw him off Erin. She gasped as the sword fell to the ground and rolled away as the two Antinium crashed into chairs, fighting, punching and kicking in the darkness.\nErin scrambled away and struck a table. She ran to a shuttered window and threw it open. The moonlight illuminated the room just in time for her to see one of the two Workers mount the other. The Antinium seized his struggling opponent’s head and\ntwisted\nwith all four arms.\nThe neck broke. The Worker lay still. The other Worker stood up and stared at Erin.\nShe held the frying pan and jar of acid in shaking hands.\n“Stay back! I’m warning you!”\nThe Worker walked towards Erin. She raised the frying pan, and he stopped. The Worker raised all four arms.\n“Please. I mean you no harm.”\nThe words were familiar. The way of speaking was familiar. Erin hesitated.\n“…Pawn?”\n“I am not Pawn.”\nThe Worker shook his head. But he was not Ksmvr either. He knelt before Erin suddenly, and she nearly tossed the jar of acid. But the Worker made no move. He spoke to her, voice loud in the silence.\n“I am Knight.”\n“Knight?”\nHe nodded. The Worker stared up at Erin.\n“I have named myself. I have chosen. I am Individual, first and last of my kind. I am Knight, and no other is like me. And I am here to protect you. We are here to protect you.”\nErin stared at him. The frying pan loosened in her grip, and she nearly dropped it. Her mind was spinning. She stared at Knight. There was something familiar about him, too.\n“I—I don’t know you. I never—”\nKnight straightened.\n“Please, Erin Solstice. You must remain calm. We are here to protect you.”\n“We?”\nMovement. Suddenly, Erin saw it outside the window. She threw caution to the wind and raced outside, brushing past Knight. There she stopped.\nAntinium. Workers. They stood around the inn, arms folded or holding weapons. Swords, maces, axes—and not just those. Rolling pins, rocks, large branches…even a large vase in one case. They stared silently at Erin as she froze in place.\n“Who—”\nKnight emerged from the inn and bowed his head to Erin.\n“The dead are coming. Please remain inside. We will protect you with our lives.”\nShe looked at him.\n“You? But who are you? Where’s Pawn?”\n“He was kept in the Hive by the Prognugator. He remains. But we have come. We have chosen. We are Individual.”\n“Individual?”\nKnight nodded. In front of Erin, a Worker turned. He bowed to her, low, as far as his stiff exoskeleton would permit.\n“I have chosen. I am Bishop.”\nAnother Antinium turned and then another.\n“I too chose. I have decided. My name is Vladimir.”\n“I am Calabrian.”\n“I am Emanuel.”\n“Call me Garry.”\n“I wish to be known as Milner-Barry.”\n“Belgrade. I will die for you.”\n“We will all die for you. I am Jose.”\nThey spoke, one by one, in the faint moonlight. Antinium looked at Erin, all alike on the outside. But each one different, each one individual.\nThey were all familiar to her. And only now did Erin realize. She knew them. She knew them all. They had never had names, but she knew their faces, the way they played. She knew them.\nThey were her chess club.\nThirty odd Workers stood on the hilltop, ringing the inn, waiting. Erin could barely speak. She felt it. A surge of terrible emotion—whether fear or happiness or sadness, it was impossible to say. But she knew something had happened. They had all chosen names.\nBut that was only half of the question. The other half burned in her fiercely. She turned to Knight. The Antinium was staring into the darkness, splashes of green blood still coating his carapace.\n“Why are you all here? Why now? Why tonight? What—what’s happening?”\nHe opened his mandibles to reply. And that was when the first zombie appeared out of the night and tried to take a bite out of Erin’s face. Toren leapt out of the darkness, crashing into the zombie, and the two rolled down the hill.\nErin screamed. More bodies shuffled and ran through the grass as the Workers moved to intercept them. And then the night was filled with the dead, and Erin found herself fighting for her life.",

    "text": "“Fall back!\nFall back!\n”\nZevara screamed as Skinner grabbed a Drake and pulled his scales and skin off him like a child pulling a wrapper off a bit of candy. The horrific white face grinned down at her, sunken crimson eyes staring around layers of folded dead flesh. Fragments of metal clung to its chest, deflecting some of the arrows striking it.\nShe tried to raise her sword to slash at it, but her arm refused to move. Zevara had fought countless monsters, had faced and come close to death several times. But the terror that Skinner projected dwarfed anything she had ever felt before.\nZevara retreated, trembling, as Skinner’s hand swept around and grabbed a struggling guardsman. The female Gnoll had only a moment to howl in fear and agony before she was dead.\nAll around Zevara, guardsmen were retreating or dying. The undead flooded through the gates around Skinner, slaughtering the helpless warriors. Only the Antinium fought on, Ksmvr and the five remaining Soldiers blockading one street, but even they were falling back. No one could fight Skinner, and every time one of his hands swung down, someone died.\nZevara prayed they died. To live without skin—she hoped they died instantly, rather than imagine there was still life in the silent piles of bones and intestines and muscle that lay on the ground.\nSkinner grinned at her. His folds of thick, white skin grinned at her too, the faces of the dead stretched to canvas his body.\nShe had to run. Zevara felt it in her bones, in her marrow. But she was Captain of the Watch. She couldn’t run. She had to\nfight\n. But her body wasn’t listening to her mind.\nSkinner loomed over her. He tossed what remained of the Gnoll to the ground and raised his hand towards Zevara. She dove out of the way, dropping her sword, and the palm smashed into the ground next to her.\nThe impact knocked the Drake sideways, but she scrambled away. The red spots. It was the red spots on Skinner’s hand. Touch those and your skin would be peeled away. She had to keep her distance. She had to run—\nToo late, Zevara saw the other hand circling around. She was running right into it. She tried to stop, but it was too late. Skinner closed his hand around Zevara’s scales—\n“\nRelc attack!\n”\nSomething blurred past Zevara and stabbed into the hand. Dead skin fell around spear tip as a green Drake grabbed both spear and Zevara and ran nimbly past Skinner. Zevara gaped as Relc, Senior Guardsmen of the Watch, grinned toothily at her and twirled the spear as he ran.\n“Heya, Captain! Mind if I take this one on?”\n“Relc!”\nIt was a warning. Relc turned his head, and both he and Zevara hit the ground as Skinner swiped at them. His hand smashed into a wooden building instead and shook the foundations. Skinner stared at both Drakes, and Zevara felt her scales growing cold with fear. But Relc just shook himself and bared his sharp teeth.\n“\nSoldiers, fall back.\nI’m going to need some room for this.”\nHe raised his voice, and somehow, it was audible over the fighting, over the terror in Zevara’s heart. Men and women looked up—and the Drake shivered as that crimson stare fixed upon him again, like a lighthouse.\nTerror. Terror—death and terror!\nIt was primordial, deep, and even Zevara wanted to void her bowels and flee. It took all her will to hold her sword steady.\nBut Relc just shouted.\n“\nClear a space. Hold the lines!\n”\nHe wasn’t Senior Guardsman Relc in that moment. The former soldier of Liscor’s army spun his spear. [Sergeant] Relc held his ground. And Skinner…stared at him, then seemed to realize Relc was immune to the stare. Relc’s body lowered.\n“Not an officer. I hate fighting monsters.”\nHe was watching Skinner. The undead froze—then lashed out so fast his hands cut the air.\nBut Relc was already gone. Zevara’s head whirled.\nWhere—\nSkinner had missed as well. A second hand had come out, grasping for the Drake, but Relc hadn’t dodged left or right. He’d\nlaunched\nhimself from the ground with his spear. He landed as the monsters swiveled, kicked a Ghoul aside—\nBlurred past a Crypt Lord whose head vanished as Skinner ripped it off. A green figure, zig-zagging through the undead as if they were statues. Zevara heard someone mumble something. They had once had a nickname for him, hadn’t they? In his days in the army.\n“The Gecko of Liscor.”\nA zombie popped up on his right side, but Relc raised his spear and ran the undead Human through. He kicked the zombie’s corpse off his blade into a skeleton, punched a Ghoul to the ground, and looked up as Skinner’s other hand swept towards him.\nRelc raised his spear and met the hand as it flew at him. His spear’s tip stabbed rapidly into the open red sores in Skinner’s hand. The monster jerked, and for the first time, Zevara thought she heard a sound come from the creature’s mouth.\nNo—not the mouth. It came from inside Skinner, a high-pitched shriek that echoed across the city.\nIt was deafeningly loud, but barely within Zevara’s auditory range. She clapped her hands to her ears, and Relc staggered back, doing the same.\nSkinner swiped at Relc and caught him on the leg with an open palm. Relc roared and stabbed down with his spear, and Skinner let go just as quickly. The Drake staggered backwards, and Zevara saw part of the scales on his leg had been stripped away.\nThe Drake slashed Skinner’s arm, but the monster brought his limb out of harm’s way. A hand swung back—Relc leaned under it as it beheaded a Wight—\nFast as a sword’s swings.\nBut the [Spearmaster] was watching it, reacting before the arms even reached him.\nAgain, Skinner fixed Relc with his crimson gaze. But though Zevara saw Relc shudder, he gritted his teeth and fought through the magic affecting him. He raised his spear and dashed towards Skinner, cutting and stabbing as he ran across the monster’s side.\nChunks of flesh sloughed to the ground as Skinner swung his hands at Relc. The Drake dodged away, keeping too close to Skinner’s body to be caught. The massive undead suddenly rolled, and Relc had to dodge away before being squashed.\n“You bastard! [Triple Thrust]!”\nHe struck so fast Zevara didn’t see it, three lancing jabs. But the thick flesh—Relc yanked the spear out, cursing. He slashed, his arms a blur—stepped back. Then just backed away.\nWhy?\nHe wasn’t doing any damage. Dead skin littered the ground, but Skinner just rolled back upright and attacked again.\nRelc ran through the undead, stabbing and knocking them aside like flies as the hands struck at him. The zombies and skeletons weren’t able to even slow him down, and the Ghouls he neatly dispatched with a spear strike to the neck or head.\nSuddenly free of Skinner’s gaze, the guardsmen around Zevara turned and formed another line. The Drake Captain found another sword and sliced a zombie apart as Relc blurred towards them.\nFaster, stronger, and unaffected by fear. That was Relc, Senior Guardsman, the strongest guard in the city. Perhaps the world. A Level 33 [Spearmaster].\nHe paused in front of Zevara, panting. She saw red blood running from his leg and grabbed a healing potion from her belt.\n“Here!”\n“Thanks.”\nHe nodded and smashed the bottle against his leg. The purple liquid ran into the gaping wound, and he sighed.\n“Damn. This isn’t good.”\n“Do you know what that thing is?”\nZevara pointed to Skinner as the monster slowly rolled back upright, the undead around him forming a living wall. Relc shook his head. He was focused and barked a reply between gulps of a second potion. Stamina.\n“Something ugly? It’s—strong. All that dead flesh is like armor. I need to slice it away to get at what’s underneath. But one touch of those hands—”\n“Can you kill it?”\nRelc paused and then grinned at Zevara.\n“I can. Maybe. Probably. But give me some of those Antinium just to be safe.”\n“The Antinium? Why—”\nRelc pointed. Ksmvr was slicing apart zombies as the four Soldiers still alive covered his back. Even as Skinner rolled back upright and stared at Ksmvr, he kept fighting, undeterred by the crimson stare.\n“The Ants are immune to whatever he’s doing. So am I.”\n“Why’s that?”\nRelc grinned and tapped his head with one claw.\n“[Indomitable Will]. Anyone without a similar Skill should fall back. This thing—it’s projecting fear. Like a Level 30 [Mage]. Higher.”\n“I got that. Can you take it out with just them?”\n“I can try. But give me more [Archers] and [Mages] to get rid of the undead. I can’t have them on my back\nand\nthat thing.”\n“Just stop it for now while I call a retreat. We’ll set up another street and give you a chance—”\nZevara stopped, and Relc turned. Skinner was moving. The giant creature stared hard at Relc as the Drake raised his spear. But suddenly, Skinner turned. He pulled himself around and began moving back through the crowd of undead.\nRelc crowed as Skinner pulled himself away. He twirled his spear and broke a skeleton’s skull with the butt end as he shouted at Skinner.\n“Yeah, that’s right! Run!\nRun!\nFinally met someone with too many scales for ya, huh?\nRun away and\n…wait a second.”\nRelc blinked. Skinner\nwas\nleaving. Not just retreating; he was pulling himself back out the gates while a wall of undead protected his ‘back’.\n“It’s…leaving?”\nZevara stared at Skinner in confusion. Why was he going?\n“He must sense you’re a threat.”\nRelc swore, and Zevara nearly spat fire at Pisces as the mage appeared out of thin air. The Human flinched, but pointed at Skinner as Relc glared at him.\n“This creature is highly intelligent, guardsmen. It won’t fight anything that can resist its fear effect and poses a credible threat. Perhaps it could win, but it won’t risk that.”\n“Why?”\nPisces shrugged.\n“Most of the more valuable undead specimens have some kind of survival function built into it. I surmise this being may be the same.”\n“Being? It’s not undead?”\n“No.”\nRelc grabbed Pisces as Zevara stared at him. The Drake shook the mage none too gently.\n“Okay, but where is that thing going? Is it going back into the ruins or do we have to worry about reinforcements now? Even without that monster, we’re still up to our ears in undead!”\n“I don’t know!\nI don’t know!\n”\nPisces fought to get Relc to release him. He shouted as the undead resumed their attack on the lines of guardsmen.\n“Perhaps it seeks to wear us down first! Or maybe it goes after easier prey! I can’t tell!”\nRelc released Pisces with disgust. He turned back to Zevara.\n“Well, that’s just great. If it comes back with another horde, we’re cooked. But what could it want if it wants more victims? There’s only a few farming villages around here and they’re almost all north or west, not\neast\n. So where—”\nHe broke off, eyes widening. Zevara looked at him as Relc turned towards the east. He breathed the words.\n“Oh no.”\nPisces looked at Relc’s face and then east too. He blinked in sudden comprehension, and his face turned slightly pale.\n“Erin.”\nHe and Pisces were starting after Skinner, and Zevara was about to call Relc back. Then—the monster paused at the gates. She saw it turn—and that ‘hand’ rose. Skinner looked at Relc. At Pisces. And its grotesque hand moved. Almost in a parody—a mockery of Pisces.\nSkinner snapped its ‘fingers’—and the fallen undead began to get up. The ones hacked to pieces slowly began to rejoin. Watch Captain Zevara turned—and Pisces turned dead white.\n“It just—”\nA fallen Ghoul sat up, and Relc beheaded it. Then he watched the Ghoul fall over—the glowing eyes fade—and flicker back to life as the severed section of its head began to drift back to its body.\n“Fall back!”\nContemptuously, Skinner hauled itself away as a second wave of undead rose and joined the first. Then the Watch was in full retreat, fleeing, trying to block the streets. And every single member of the living that fell rose once more. It left the city and the danger with a tiny bodyguard. Too much direct danger here. Skinner’s glowing gaze turned elsewhere, to the only other pocket of life it sensed. A handful of villages. And…\nAn inn.\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "Why did the dead try to kill the living? Was it hatred?\nDid they seek to defile the living, to drag them into the same unending torment of their lives? Did they envy those who still drew breath? Or was it a greater mystery? Did the undead simply want others to join them, to add to their endless numbers?\nMaybe—perhaps—the dead simply resented the living. Maybe they remembered the past, and it hurt them. Or that they could understand the living and wished to ease their suffering.\nIt could be they just knew how ugly they were and didn’t want anyone to look.\nErin screamed as an almost completely decomposed Gnoll came close. He had no face. Nothing that she would use that word for. Just—rot. Horrible, black innards that still twitched and slapped together wetly as he lurched at her.\nA hand seized the zombie around the remains of his ruined head. Ignoring the flesh and other things that\nsquelched\naround his fist completely, Knight tightened his grip until something\ncrunched\nand the zombie jerked and fell still. The Worker dropped the corpse to the ground and kicked the body away. He stood, protectively shielding Erin at the entrance of the inn.\nAround the hill, the dead were struggling with the living. But there were no screams. At least, the Antinium did not scream. The dead did. They howled or made ghastly sucking sounds or sometimes groaned, but the screaming was what terrified Erin. She felt they shouldn’t be\nable\nto. The dead should be silent.\nBut they weren’t. If anything, it was the Workers who more closely resembled silent reapers. They moved in unison, fighting, blocking, forming a living line as they fought against the undead. Sometimes they spoke, but with a terrifying calmness of their own.\n“Die.”\n“Suffer.”\n“Perish.”\nTwo Antinium gripped a zombie by each arm and tore him apart. Another seized a skeleton with two hands and ripped out its ribs with the other two.\nThey fought like machines. Uncaring machines that took apart the undead like a child taking apart legos. Sometimes, it was a clean dissection. Other times, they smashed the dead bodies to make them fall apart.\nBut for all that, they were like children. None of the Workers knew how to fight. They were extremely strong, but clumsy. And the undead may have been rotting, but they were all killers.\nA Worker staggered back, arms grasping as a skeleton slid forwards, bashing at the Antinium’s head with a mace. It nimbly dodged the Worker that strove to seize a bony arm and raised its mace to crush the Antinium’s skull.\n“No!”\nThe skeleton looked up, and a flying frying pan crashed into its face. The yellow flames in its eyes dimmed, and the Antinium took the chance to seize it.\nErin watched the Worker begin to dismantle the skeleton and stared at her hand. She hadn’t even realized she’d thrown the frying pan. But more undead were charging up the hill towards the inn.\n“Stay behind me, please.”\nKnight pushed Erin back as more undead crashed into the line of Antinium, this time from the back. The Antinium wavered as they struggled to hold the dead back. Erin saw one of the Workers slip and fall as a Ghoul tackled him. The undead began tearing at him.\nHe had a name. He’d told it to Erin. Magnus. Magnus as in Magnus Carlsen, a name taken from Earth’s chess champion. He fell down, and Erin saw his blood. It was green.\n“\nNo!\n”\nShe tried to run forwards, but Knight seized Erin by the waist and lifted her up.\n“You must not. You must not put yourself in danger. We are here for your protection.”\nMagnus fell, shielding his face. Erin pulled harder, but Knight refused to let go.\n“He’s\ndying!\n”\n“Yes. The enemy surrounds us. We are at a disadvantage. This must be rectified.”\nKnight pulled Erin back and raised his hand. He spoke calmly.\n“[Defense Formation].”\nMagnus thrust the Ghoul back and raised his hand, ignoring the green blood that splattered the ground around him.\n“[Attack Formation].”\nHe collapsed silently as a Ghoul finished tearing through his exoskeleton. The undead Drake pulled something out of Magnus and opened his mouth to consume it.\nA scream of rage preceded a jar of acid by only a second. The Ghoul stumbled backwards, clawing at its face as the acid melted flesh away. He fell back, and another Antinium calmly hit him with a mop, sending him slumping to the ground.\nErin felt the effects of the two Skills hit her as she raised another jar of acid and threw it. She felt lighter—so much lighter! And it seemed as though she had suddenly grown a pair of eyes on the back of her head. She was aware of the undead around her, just as she was aware of how the other Antinium were moving.\nThey held the line. Even as the undead ran up the hill, the Workers met them, calmly ganging up on the individual undead in twos and threes. The Antinium had no sense of fair play, and the undead were hard pressed to defend themselves against three sets of four hands stabbing at once.\nA Ghoul rushed past two Antinium and ran towards Knight. The Antinium raised his sword, but a skeleton leapt past him and knifed the Ghoul in the chest. Toren and the Ghoul fell, stabbing and biting at each other.\nErin spun. She lifted a pot and hurled it. A zombie staggered backwards. She had—she\nhad\nhad quite a few pots and pans she’d seized from her kitchen, but she was running out. She’d hurled them into the crowd, trusting to her [Unerring Throw] skill.\nNow the undead were falling, retreating. Erin stared as zombies began turning, running backwards. Was it a feint? Were more undead coming? She looked around wildly, searching for movement in the darkness.\nNo. No more undead were coming for the moment—they were all dead. Toren pulled himself away from the Ghoul, reclaiming an arm as the Ghoul jerked once and then lay still.\nHow many horrors had died here? A hundred? Two hundred? It felt like a thousand.\n“Thirty-four.”\nKnight said it calmly as a skeleton fell down, skull cracked open from one of Erin’s frying pans. She stared at the Worker as silence fell and the last corpse stopped twitching.\n“\nWhat?\n”\n“We have killed thirty-four of the undead. The rest have retreated. They will return in greater numbers, I believe.”\nErin stared at Knight as the Antinium calmly cleaned gore off of his sword. Around her, the Workers were helping each other to their feet, carrying the bodies down, and…digging?\nYes, the uninjured Workers were digging in the ground. Dirt flew into the air as they dug a long, wide trench around the inn. They were building a moat. A\nmoat.\n“What’s happening? What is all this?”\nErin stared at the dead, at the Workers, and at Knight. She felt dizzy, sick. And not just from the carnage. Just a few moments ago, she’d been waiting for Rags, and now there were Workers with names and the living dead.\nAnd the smell. Erin threw up a little in her mouth but refused to let her stomach heave anything else up.\nKnight bowed his head to Erin again. He was like Pawn only—different. Physically, they were the same, but even though they had the same voice, the same body, and both had named themselves after chess pieces, he was different. Erin couldn’t explain why or how. She just knew.\n“The city of Liscor and the surrounding area is under attack, Erin Solstice. A horde of the undead emerged from the Ruins and besieged the city around an hour ago.”\nErin stared in horror at Knight. She fought to make her mouth work.\n“The ruins? Undead? You mean they came from there? Did something set them—”\nHer heart skipped a beat, and her stomach lurched.\n“Oh no. The Horns of Hammerad. They went in there. Are they…?”\nKnight shook his head.\n“Several adventurers reached the city alive. I do not know any more than that.”\nErin seized Knight by the shoulder, ignoring the fluids that coated his carapace.\n“Any Minotaurs? Anyone with pointy ears? An Elf? Half-Elf, I mean.”\nAgain, he shook his head.\n“No such adventurers were seen. The only ones who survived were Humans. A…captain of one of the teams. A woman wearing silver armor. And a few other Humans. No one else.”\nErin stared at Knight, wide-eyed. Her thoughts melded together and then shut down. Knight nodded his head at her.\n“I am sorry.”\nShe did throw up, then. Erin bent down and hurled up her lunch and dinner. She felt a cool hand on her neck, steadying her, and as she gasped and cried, Knight helped her back up.\nIt took several minutes for Erin to regain…control of herself. She was crying, talking incoherently, clutching Knight’s hand in a death grip as Toren brought her some water. She drank it, spat, threw up, drank some more, and finally stopped.\nShe didn’t stop panicking. She didn’t stop the agony in her heart or the terrible loss. But she put it inside her for a while to focus on the now. Erin looked at Knight as the Antinium studied the trench, which was only getting deeper around her inn.\n“What’s happening? How many zombies are in the city?”\nHe paused, and another Worker—Calabrian—volunteered the details.\n“The fighting was intensifying as we left. Over thirty thousand undead creatures have attacked Liscor, and the Watch fights them in the streets.”\n“H-how do you know how many…?”\nShe couldn’t see in the dark. It sounded so precise—Knight pointed left.\n“One of our number, Bird, counted them. At least thirty thousand.”\nThirty\nthousand\n. Erin tried to remember how many guards she’d seen at the gates or patrolling through the city. There were so many of them, but against tens of thousands of undead? More than that?\nShe turned to Knight.\n“Should we—I mean, can we help them? How bad is it?”\nHe shook his head and gestured to her inn.\n“Going out would not be wise. The undead fill the grasslands and will attack anything living. They have come here and will attack again soon. We are here to protect you, but you must stay here.”\nErin stared at him in horror. She stammered, and her voice cracked.\n“Me? But—I’m just one person. Why me?”\nHe returned her gaze seriously, black, faceted eyes intent on her face.\n“You are alive. That is all the reason they need.”\n“And they’re out there? Regrouping?”\n“Yes. Can you see them?”\nHe pointed, and Erin looked out. There was little light anywhere—the stars and moon were the only sources out here, but her eyes had grown accustomed to the night. She looked, and the sight made her stomach tighten with fear.\nDark shapes moving in the moonlight. They filled the plains, moving slowly, a cluster of shapes surrounding something white that was approaching the inn.\n“Oh gods. There are\nthousands\nof them.”\n“Hundreds. They move towards us.”\nKnight’s words sent a chill down Erin’s spine. She opened her mouth to say something and then froze.\n“Hold on. What’s that thing in the distance?”\nErin squinted. It was the white mass the undead were surrounding. At first, she thought it was just a bunch of them moving together, but it was something else. It was far away, but coming…closer?\n“Is it…a giant slug?”",

    "text": "The Watch of Liscor fell back, fighting, loosing arrows into the undead crowd, casting spells. Fighting, retreating.\nDying.\nThey were outnumbered and fighting across a wider and wider area. The gates had let in the undead like a virus. And so long as they had been contained to the first few streets, the battle had been even, perhaps even in the defender’s favor.\nBut with Skinner’s arrival breaking their ranks and the ceaseless influx of the dead, the streets had been overrun. And more and more dead had surged down alleyways, forcing Zevara to pull her warriors back further and further or become surrounded. And as they did, the scope of the battle extended until dozens of streets were locked in desperate combat, stretching thin numbers even further.\nA sign of how the battle was going lay with the civilians. They were being evacuated to the southern section of the city—the children and those unable to fight, that was. Everyone else was fighting. Those with class levels and even those without.\nThey fought, Drakes and Gnolls and the few Humans, healing themselves with potions, making the enemy pay for each step with blood. But the dead were bloodless. And they just kept coming.\nZevara and twenty guardsmen fought down one of the main streets, trying to stem the flow of the dead. They weren’t enough, not for such a wide passage. But overturned wagons had barricaded part of the street and created a kill zone.\nThe problem was that the dead were coming over the roofs, scaling walls, running through alleys. Zevara had archers shooting down as many as possible, but the defenders would still have been quickly overrun were it not for the Human and Drake fighting at the front.\nPisces pointed, and another Ghoul jerked. Beneath his rotted skin, his spine twisted and broke, and the undead collapsed soundlessly. The [Necromancer] turned, and more undead fell down as if their strings had been cut. He had accounted for over half of the fallen dead lying in piles on the street. The other half were due to Relc.\nThe Drake stood in the center of the undead mob, spear spinning around him too quick to follow. He stuck a zombie through its head with the shaft of his spear, twirled the butt up to shatter a skeleton’s jaw, ducked another skeleton, punched a Ghoul hard enough to break its ribs, and then beheaded a zombie with a wicked cut from the tip of his spear.\nZevara cut down a skeleton and gasped as it cut her shallowly across one arm as it fell. She stabbed it until the lights in its eyes faded and saw the massive creature approaching Relc from behind.\n“\nRelc!\n”\nThe Senior Guardsman spun around and hurled his spear. The Crypt Lord staggered back, the spear lodged deep within its chest. Relc ran forwards and seized the shaft of the spear. With a roar, he ripped it back out, kicking the giant undead backwards as he did. The Crypt Lord fell on its back, and Relc stabbed downwards, spear blurring until the bloated creature lay still.\nHe staggered back and ran back towards the barricade as the undead tried to encircle him. The guardsmen opened up a small gap for him to squeeze through, and then he was beside Zevara as they pushed the dead back.\n“Damn.”\nRelc coughed and swore as Zevara moved back with him. His scales were covered in black bile, and she instantly grabbed a potion out of one of the crates and handed it to him.\nRelc took a sip of the potion, spat black liquid out, and drank the rest. He threw the empty flask over the barricade and nodded at Zevara.\n“Thanks. I got some of the poison in my mouth.”\nShe scowled, but couldn’t put any of her usual force in her words.\n“Be careful. If we lose you, our line will collapse.”\nRelc grinned at her wearily.\n“Hey, don’t worry, Captain Z. None of those things can scratch my scales. If there weren’t so many of them, this would be as easy as frying fish.”\n“But there are a lot of them, and they just don’t stop\ncoming\n.”\nZevara hissed in fury, and her tail lashed the ground as she pointed.\n“It makes no sense. They’re not congregating in one spot, and they’re attacking every side. Like a real army would do. And that guard they have around the gates is—”\n“Not like them. I know.”\nRelc’s eyes narrowed as he stared in the direction of the open north gate. Despite their best efforts, they hadn’t managed to retake it, not even with Relc. The dead around the massive metal doors refused to budge, and the gates were cumbersome enough to close on their own.\n“It’s that damned skin-creature that’s doing it. So long as it’s around, they’re going to keep coming. If you’d let me go after it…”\nZevara shook her head curtly.\n“You wouldn’t make it out the gates before they surrounded you. And that thing is too much for you to handle alone.”\nHe glared at her.\n“And so we’re going to leave it? I told you, it’s going after Erin—”\n“Do you want me to try and save one Human in this mess?”\nZevara shouted at Relc. He blinked, and she continued.\n“No matter what that thing is doing, we can’t spare anyone to go after it, let alone you. If we knew what it was doing, then maybe—”\n“Waiting.”\nZevara and Relc turned. Pisces stumbled back towards them. His face was pale, and his hair and robes were matted with sweat. He stumbled towards a cart holding water flasks and drank greedily.\nThe Captain of the Watch looked back towards the fighting. Without Relc and Pisces, the guardsmen were already beginning to be pushed back.\n“We need you to keep casting, Human. If you can’t, we have plenty of mana potions—”\nPisces glared at Zevara.\n“Potions do not cure exhaustion. Even my efficient spells tax me. I must rest.”\n“I’ll go. The poison’s cured.”\nSo saying, Relc sprinted to one of the wagons and leapt. He kicked the skeleton that was climbing over it and landed on the other side, spear already blurring. Pisces drank more water, and both watched as Relc kept fighting.\nZevara glanced at Pisces.\n“What did you mean? That creature is waiting?”\nHe nodded and wiped at his mouth.\n“It is clear that these dead are protecting that skin creature in some way. It may have control over the dead or spellcasting ability—regardless, they act as convenient fodder while it takes the skin of creatures to sustain itself.”\n“Then why did it leave?”\n“The danger. As I said, your Senior Guardsman posed an actual threat. It realized this and withdrew. It will let the undead keep fighting until we are exhausted and it returns. Remember—for each one of us that falls, it has another minion to use against us.”\nZevara knew that. She was more worried about the trick it had pulled before it left.\n“What about reanimating the undead we’ve already slain? How many times can it do that?”\nPisces shrugged. He looked as unnerved by that as she did.\n“I’ve heard of undead doing that, but not even the ones I saw at Wistram could—it’s a spellcaster. But it cannot do that forever. Only a few times, I suspect. And it might not be able to control all the undead. The Crypt Lords are lesser leaders. The fact that greater undead than them haven’t been created is odd. So many dead gathered for so long together—”\n“And why the girl? Why is it going out after that Erin Solstice? The one who got Klbkch killed?”\nPisces hesitated again, and Zevara wondered if he was about to lie. When he spoke, it was with clear reluctance.\n“…She probably doesn’t matter at all. It’s simply how that creature works. He will eliminate every living being in the area and surround the city with his army. He senses her, no doubt, and wishes to eliminate any possible threat. Or perhaps it is fleeing east then north, towards Esthelm, to minimize the risk to itself.”\n“Well. We may have time if that’s the case.”\nPisces opened his mouth, and his eyes widened with outrage. Then he looked at her, really\nlooked\nat her panting for air, the screaming, embattled city, and closed his mouth and nodded.\n“Yes. Perhaps. But we will be overrun soon if there are many more of the undead.”\nIt was a statement both knew to be true. Zevara shook her head. She raised her sword, feeling exhaustion in her arm. Flames trickled from around her mouth as she spoke.\n“Drink whatever potions you need. Rest if you must. But get back to casting quickly, mage.”\nShe ran back towards the guardsmen as they struggled to hold back several zombies. Pisces stared after her and shook his head. He took a few quick steps back and then made his way to a pile of dead corpses that archers had shot off rooftops.\nThe skeletons, Ghouls, and zombies had taken the rooftops and smashed in their skulls or splattered on the ground when the arrows had knocked them off their perches. But as Pisces raised his hands, the shattered flesh and bone reknit, and the dead rose back upwards, unearthly lights appearing in their eyes.\nSix zombies, three skeletons, and four Ghouls stood up, staring at Pisces. He pointed east, in the direction of the gates.\n“Go. Avoid fighting until you reach the inn. Protect the girl. Kill any who would harm her. Go.”\nPisces watched the undead run towards the barricade, moving past the startled defenders. He smiled crookedly and had to sit down as the effects of the spell hit him.\n“My, my. I suppose I’m a little too invested in that girl for my own good.”\nHe laughed and cast his eyes towards the sky.\n“Well. A token deed. It will not amount to much. Not when…”\nHis voice trailed off. Pisces stared blankly at the undead fighting with the Watch. He was a [Necromancer]. He could sense how many dead were in the city and outside it, a fact he had carefully neglected to mention.\nAfter a moment, he smiled again and stood up. His blood was burning in agony, and he felt nauseous, exhausted. Even a potion wouldn’t help him, but the undead still fell as he killed them methodically.\nPisces laughed as the dead fell around him, uncaring of the toll. They would die. All of them. The few living guardsmen and citizens couldn’t stem the tide any more than Erin would survive. He laughed and cast his eyes skyward again, perhaps for the last time.\n“Ah, but what a wonderful night to die!”\nHe could have run. Yet…the [Necromancer] looked around. He had the [Invisibility] spell upon his lips. It would be simple to cast it and hide from the undead. He, of all people in Liscor, could probably evade them and escape with his life.\nBut—Selys was swinging a sword on one side, Zevara holding the line on the other. Relc was fighting ahead of him. Another, reasonable man might have fled.\n“But I’m better than that. I am…”\nThe [Necromancer] whispered the words, and his head turned as his friendly undead ran past the ones under Skinner’s control. Pisces never finished his sentence. He whirled, waved his hand, and a group of zombies collapsed. He pointed, and the dead died. But they kept coming. And coming.\nAnd coming.",

    "text": "“Oh god. What is that?”\nErin stared down towards the white shape moving towards them. Every time it dragged itself towards her, more horrific details emerged. At first, it was just a white shape, a sickly slug. Then it was a slug with arms, and then…a creature of some kind. But then she saw that its skin wasn’t skin but dead flesh packed together. And then she saw the\nfaces\n, stretched across the skin and…\nThey ran towards the Antinium, Skinner’s small army. They fell into the huge trench the Antinium had dug, breaking bones, climbing out only to be kicked back in by the Workers.\nThere weren’t many. Around a hundred or less. That’s what Knight had said. As if that wasn’t enough to bury them all in corpses anyways. Most of the undead had moved back towards the city. But the creature came on, dragging itself through the grass.\nIt left glistening chunks of itself behind. Pieces of dead skin. It horrified Erin more than anything.\nBut she had to fight. Erin lifted another jar of acid and hurled it at a Crypt Lord. The massive, bloated creature\nshrieked\nand slapped itself with its clawed hands. But the acid ate away its skin, melting the massive creature’s outsides in a matter of minutes.\nThat was her role. Erin stood at the door of her inn, throwing jars of acid, pots, pans, knives, anything she could. She had one frying pan next to her as an emergency weapon, and she’d already hurled most of her chairs down the hill.\nIt was working. It was working. The dead were filling the trenches, but they hadn’t broken past the Workers yet. It was working—\nSkinner had reached the bottom of the hill the inn was on. He raised his head and looked up. Two crimson eyes flashed at Erin, and suddenly, she knew fear.\nFear.\n“No…\nno.\n”\nSkinner’s eyes glowed at her under the moonlight. His gaze touched Erin and held her. It caught her and made her feel fear beyond anything she had felt. She was helpless.\nShe shook. Erin was consumed by horror, pure, unfiltered terror that paralyzed her to her core. The crimson stare was death. Hers.\nShe couldn’t even move. She couldn’t even scream.\nErin felt something tugging at her. Knight grabbed her and pulled her backwards, towards the doors of her inn. He shoved her inside, and she stumbled, partly free of Skinner’s gaze on her.\n“This creature projects fear of some kind. Please, move back. We will handle this.”\nErin stared at Knight. She worked her jaw soundlessly.\n“I—”\nShe wanted to say she’d keep fighting. But she couldn’t. She glanced outside, and Skinner stared at her. He was grinning, his toothless, empty mouth a gaping hole. She froze up, and Knight blocked the door with his body.\n“Stay behind me.”\nThe undead surged forwards as one. The Workers met them as they tried to leap the moat and failed and knocked the undead into the pit. Several zombies managed to tug one Worker into the pit, where he disappeared under a pile of discolored limbs. But the line was holding.\nWas holding.\nSkinner’s gaze moved from the inn for one second. He seemed to regard the ditch and then looked back towards the inn. For a second, Knight wondered what had happened. And then the ranks of the dead drew back, and a larger creature lurched forwards.\nA Crypt Lord stood on the other side of the trench. But he—or rather she—didn’t try to cross. Instead, the Crypt Lord began spitting, sending huge gouts of black blood raining over the Workers.\nSeveral Workers hurled their weapons across the ditch, but they bounced off the Crypt Lord’s thick, discolored skin. It spat blood back at them, and the Workers shielded their faces ineffectually with their hands.\nSuddenly, the moat was no longer a barrier but a liability. The Antinium could not cross to fight the Crypt Lord and instead had to retreat while it poisoned them.\nKnight watched as two Workers fell, curling up into balls as the poison killed them. He stared as the undead swarmed into the trenches and up the other side. He sighed.\nChess was not at all like battle. There were some similarities, and the [Tactician] class leveled with chess. But it did not teach fighting. It did not account for unpredictability. Chess was a beautiful thing. But battle—\nBattle was uncertainty.\n“Ah. Alas.”\nKnight made sure his body was covering the door. The other shutters around the inn were closed, and the second floor was also shut off. Any dead creature could break in, though. He gestured and raised his voice.\n“Close ranks.”\nThe Workers stepped back, forming a wall around the inn. There were just over twenty left now, some injured, many without weapons. They had learned something of fighting, though. They would not die easily.\nKnight turned his head slightly and saw Erin was still staring out at the undead as they cleared the moat. Her face was pale. He tried to smile, but all he could do was lift his mandibles slightly. What would Pawn say at a time like this? What was the right thing to say?\n“Please stay inside. You will be safe here.”\nShe tried to say something. But Skinner’s stare paralyzed her, took away her words. Knight closed the door and put his back to it.\nTwenty workers. A hundred undead creatures. Skinner. They would hold with all their might. As long as they could.\nUntil they could no longer move. Until they were no longer alive. Each Worker was resolved to die. That was simple. Knight only wished—he only wished—\nHe only wished it were enough.",

    "text": "Rags sat on the hilltop, watching. She was no longer watching the city of Liscor. That place would fall or burn. It mattered not to her.\nInstead, she was watching a small hill covered in flickering motion. Rags’ eyes were good. Even in the night, she could see the Workers struggling against the undead. She was also good at counting. That was why, despite her entire tribe sitting with her on the hill, she did not order them to move.\nIt was a sensible choice. All of Rags agreed with that. Aside from Skinner, the terrifying monster that struck fear into her heart, the undead were too numerous, too deadly. Goblins weren’t good at killing things that were already dead, and they would have been outnumbered by the dead even if they joined the Workers. Not a good fight. So why fight?\nAll of Rags agreed with her choice, even if not all of her tribe did. The frightened, pitiful Goblin part of her told her to run. And the cold [Tactician] self she had learned told her the battle was unwinnable. Rags knew this. But another part of her hurt.\nIt was a small part. It wasn’t a practical part or a particularly useful part. It knew there was no other choice. But it hurt. And it distracted her as she watched the battle.\nAbsently, Rags’ hand went up and poked at her flesh. No. It wouldn’t stop hurting. She knew she couldn’t do a thing. So why try.\nA Goblin shifted next to Rags. He wanted to go down there. But one glare from her and he stopped moving. She was Chieftain. She decided. And she had decided not to interfere.

    "text": "Knight stood against the doorway, arms stretched wide, his entire weight against the wood behind him. His legs buckled. But he refused to fall.\nThe undead had crossed the moat. They had reached the inn itself, and it was there the Workers were making their final stand.\nThey were doing well. Well enough. The lone Crypt Lord had fallen, taking five Workers with him. But the remaining Workers fought together, shielding the inn, letting their strong bodies take the brunt of the assault to protect the fragile wood.\nThey had learned. A few short minutes—or was it hours?—of battle had made them stronger. They fought with weapons methodically, killing, guarding. They were holding.\nIt was just that the dead were relentless. And they clustered thickest around the door of the inn, seeking entry.\nKnight blocked them. He took the swords and claws, not even bothering to block. He couldn’t move his arms anyways. He just had to cover the door. Simple enough. Simple. But so difficult.\nGreen blood trickled down his sides. He was cold. He had been stabbed. Was being stabbed. A group of the undead savaged him, stabbing, biting.\nA Worker hurled a zombie off him. Two more joined him, and they crushed the others, breaking them, taking them apart like a building or a carcass to be butchered.\nKnight tried to move, but felt himself sinking to the ground. No good. He had to stand. He had to be a shield. A Knight. He moved in an L-shape, but his name was more than that. He was a protector. A champion of the innocent. She had told him that. He remembered. He remembered everything.\nOne of the Workers paused before Knight. Knight struggled to remember his name. Garry? Yes, Garry. Named after Garry Kasparov, one of the greatest Grandmasters of all time. A good name.\nGarry stood beside Knight as the others covered them. He spoke.\n“You are dying.”\nKnight could no longer feel his body. But he could see. Green blood—his blood—stained the ground.\n“Yes.”\nIt was a pointless comment to make. He strained to ask the more important question.\n“Is she still safe?”\n“She is.”\n“Good.”\nThere wasn’t much else to say. Knight’s vision was growing dark. But he struggled to move, to block the doorway with just a bit more of his body. It was important. He rasped at Garry.\n“Protect her.”\nThe Worker nodded.\n“Of course. Until we perish.”\n“Good.”\nThe world was growing dark. And cold. But Knight didn’t care. He just wanted to play another game of chess again. He was sure he was better. And if—if she was alive, maybe she would remember. He had loved playing with her. Each time, no matter how few they had been, how short.\nHe wished he could play another game. He would open with the Danish Opening, risky, but push her as hard as he could. Just to hear her laugh in delight or praise him. If he could play another game in that warm room, it would be perfect bliss if—\nKnight didn’t close his eyes. He had no eyelids to close. But he stiffened, and something left him. The other Workers took no notice. They were fighting, bleeding, holding the enemy off. Only one person noticed among the dead and the living. Only one person cared.\nErin.",

    "text": "They were dying. Erin sat in her inn and heard it. She knew it. They were dying.\nAll of them.\nThe Workers fought outside, so close she could hear them as they spoke. They were short phrases that tore pieces out of her heart.\n“I have fallen.”\n“My arm has been torn off.”\n“Continue on without me. Protect her. Please.”\nPassionless inflection. But not passionless words. She heard them fall and die, begging the others to keep fighting. To protect. Protect her.\nIt hurt more than anything else. More than being stabbed, more than physical pain. But she couldn’t move. She was rooted to the spot, unable to do anything but hide.\nHide in her inn while her friends died.\nShe didn’t know their names. She’d forgotten them as they’d spoken. But she knew them. She’d played chess with each of them. Taught them. Klbkch and Pawn had brought each one countless times, and Erin knew their every move in chess.\nAnd they were dying. For her.\nShe tried to move her legs. They shook, trembling against the floorboards, refusing to carry even a bit of her weight. Her hands were the same.\nThey were dying. She\nhad\nto do something.\nErin grabbed at her frying pan and then let go of the handle. She covered her ears with her hands and curled up. She was afraid.\nAfraid.\nThe fear was overpowering. It wasn’t even a conscious thing, something Erin could fight against. It was like a basic math equation, an unchangeable part of the universe. If she fought, if she tried to fight, she would die. She couldn’t overcome that.\nBut she could still move. Erin felt it. She could run. The Workers would protect her. If she ran—\nSomething in Erin rebelled against the thought. Run? Run while they died for her?\nIt was the only sensible choice. But they were dying. For her. And that made running wrong.\nEven if it saved her? No. It was impossible. They were all trapped. The undead were everywhere. That thing was coming. Running was just a slower death.\nErin shuddered. She had heard Knight’s last words. They cut at her, pulling pieces out of her soul. She wished she could move. She wished—\nHer foot trembled and knocked against the table. Erin heard something clatter to the floor and flinched. She looked down.\nIn the moonlight, something rolled next to the chair and stopped. Erin stared at it.\nShe saw a chess piece lying on the floor. It was a broken knight piece, a Drake holding a sword and a shield, only someone had snapped it off so only the legs and base remained.\nSlowly, Erin bent to pick it up. She held the chess piece in her hand and felt at the sharp edges.\nShe put the chess piece on the board. She stared at the two sides, white and black, bathed in the red light from Skinner’s eyes. Her heart was filled with fear. Her mind was broken by terror. But her soul cried out as her friends died.\nErin’s hand moved. She pushed the white pawn piece forwards. She hesitated and then pushed a black pawn two spaces forwards.\nPawn to E4. Pawn to E5. Bishop came next, to C4. A classic opening.\nSlowly, Erin began to play. It was wrong. It was the wrong thing to do as the Workers bled and perished. But she played anyways, mechanically, playing out the game on pure instinct.\nThe pieces moved mechanically. Erin played the game, and time slowed around her. Time stopped. Time—\nTime was a strange thing. It didn’t matter at all for entire days and mattered the world in a single moment where it flashed by. For Erin, time had always disappeared when she played chess. That was why the Skill she had learned was so fitting.\nSuch a silly thing. A useless thing. It made one moment longer. It was good for a little bit, but only that. It only made a second into an eternity. It couldn’t level mountains or grant her luck or do anything else.\nIt just made a moment immortal. So Erin played. She played as the undead slaughtered her friends and Skinner’s gaze touched her heart. She played.\nA useless game. A worthless game. She lost to herself with half her pieces still on the board. But that wasn’t important. Erin reset the board and played again, moving the pieces with reckless abandon.\nIt wasn’t about chess. It was just about the time. Every second, fear etched itself into her mind, always present, always there. It was part of her and part of the endless games she played. Again. And again. Playing, always playing, until fear and living were one and the same.\n“The king is smart and uses his head. For if he moves, he’ll soon be dead.”\nErin muttered the words again. She remembered her dream and the certainty of it. The dead Goblin Chieftain. The blood. The smell of oil.\nDeath and violence.\nIf she were a king, moving, fighting would only lead to her misery. And death. She had lost friends because she’d fought. But she would lose them again if she did nothing.\n“If he moves, he’ll soon be dead.”\nBut that was just it. Someone died, even if the king didn’t. The king was a selfish jerk, letting people suffer in his place. Erin’s hand moved on the king and slowly tipped it over.\n“I am no king.”\nErin stood up. The fear was still in her, still biting, still trying to hold her down. But it was part of her now. It still tried to paralyze her thoughts, but it was old now. There was something more important than fear. More important than pain or death.\n“I am a queen. And this is my inn.”\nHow many minutes had passed? How many seconds? It felt like years, but the battle was still raging. The only difference was that Erin could move. She seized the frying pan and then hesitated.\nSlowly, Erin walked into the kitchen and came back carrying a huge glass jar. It was one of the big jars she used to store the bulk of the Acid Fly’s acid. She pushed the door slowly open and saw Knight lying in front of it.\nFor a second, Erin wavered. The jar of acid tipped in her hands. She steadied it and then looked around.\nThe dead were everywhere. But down the hill, Skinner was looking upwards. He was commanding the flow of the battle. Like a general. Like a king.\nErin supposed that made her the other king. And this was check. Well. She was promoting herself to queen and damn the rules of chess.\nSkinner stared at Erin. The crimson gaze fixed her, sending tendrils of terror into her to squeeze at her heart. But she had felt it before. It was an old trick. She lifted the jar of acid.\n“Come on, you bastard!”\nHer voice echoed from the hilltop, cutting through the sounds of battle like thunder. Erin surprised herself, but remembered her Skill. [Loud Voice].\nSkinner didn’t blink. He couldn’t. But he seemed surprised as far as Erin could tell. His gaze moved sideways, and she sensed undead moving towards her. The Workers cut them off.\nThe jar of acid sloshed in her grip. Heavy. Without her [Lesser Strength] Skill, she would barely have been able to lift it. But she raised it up onto one shoulder and then\nheaved\nit into the air like a giant shot put.\nThe glowing green projectile flew down the hill towards Skinner’s face, straight as an arrow. He raised his hand, too slowly. It broke on him, and green liquid drenched the giant monster.\nAcid covered Skinner’s face and body. He screamed, a high-pitched sound that made Erin’s teeth hurt and the Antinium clap their hands to their ear holes. But he didn’t die. He ripped his own flesh away, tearing away layers of skin. Then he looked up at Erin and\nscreamed\n.\nThe dead flooded the hilltop, and Skinner shrieked in rage, pulling himself up towards Erin, hands digging into the soil and earth.\n“Come on!”\nErin stood on top of the hill, frying pan raised, as the Workers surrounded her. Her blood was on fire. Her heart hurt. But she would keep fighting.\nSkinner stared at her. Erin stared back. Neither one blinked. He was her target. She could keep fighting until he was dead.\nShe wouldn’t stop. She would keep going, regardless of fear or death.\nUntil the moment he stopped moving. Until her last breath. Until her friends were safe or they were all dead.\nUntil the end.\nThe dead rushed at Erin, and she raised the frying pan and hit the first zombie hard enough to break all of its teeth free. The darkness moved, and the dead were everywhere.\nEverywhere.\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",

    "text": "She knew when the first skeleton cut her that she was going to die. Erin stared down at the open skin on her arm and wondered if she could push the two red halves together. She raised the frying pan and hit the skeleton with all her strength.\nIt fell down. Erin kicked it until the lights in its eyes went out. She was strong. Strong as a man? Strong enough to kill. She’d hit a dead Drake until the iron frying pan had dented and his skull had caved in and bits had squished outwards.\nBut the dead were everywhere, and somehow, each time Erin turned around, there were fewer Antinium around her. But there were always more undead. Their glowing eyes watched Erin, and their clawed hands sought her life.\nOnce, she thought she saw Toren. Her skeleton danced among the undead, sword raised, stabbing, cutting. His fellows seemed to only half notice him, only fighting back after he’d made the first blow. But he was only one, and she couldn’t tell him apart from the other skeletons.\nErin ran back and forth, ducking under slow swings, throwing the few jars of acid she had at the Ghouls as they bounded towards her, hitting skeletons aside, and seeing the black shapes protecting her. Each time a sword thrust at her heart or she stumbled, a Worker would be there, grappling a zombie away or seizing a Ghoul by the throat.\nThe girl fought, and every time she turned around, another Worker, another friend, was dying.\nAnd then she turned around and there were only the dead. The few Workers that remained struggled alone, isolated.\nErin backed up towards her inn. Eight Workers came with her. The rest lay silent. They barricaded the doors even as the undead began breaking through the windows. Erin tossed aside the frying pan that was bent nearly out of shape and realized she’d torn the skin from her palms even as she grabbed a chair.\nThe dead battered at the door as the Antinium clubbed at arms and heads breaking through the shutters, and outside, Skinner’s crimson gaze lit up the inn. He was close.\nErin was bleeding. Blood dripped from her arms and legs. Something had stabbed her in one of her breasts, and she was sure she’d never heard of that happening in a story. She clutched at her bleeding chest and sat down.\nJust for a second.\nIt was very dark.",

    "text": "Zevara stood in the center of the street as the undead rushed towards her. She took a deep breath and breathed fire.\nA stream of bright flame shot from her mouth, incinerating the front rank of the undead and making the others stop to claw at their burning forms. Zevara kept up the stream of bright fire as long as she could. Five seconds. Ten. And then she had to stop and gasp for air.\nThe world was dark. Spinning. She couldn’t breathe. Yet the enemy had been stopped for a moment. But only a moment.\nThey were everywhere. And they had pushed the defenders of the city back, back, until they were battling down the main street, next to the barracks, outside one of the entrances to the Antinium’s Hive. And though the battle still raged on, Zevara knew this was it.\nThe end. Once their lines broke this time, there would be nowhere else to go. The children and those citizens not fighting would be exposed. Already, they’d been crammed like sardines as the guardsmen had them move further and further back from the fighting. Any more and—\nWere the other streets already overrun? Liscor was massive. She had lost contact with Tkrn. Was this the last area holding?\nIt wasn’t her fault. That was what Zevara wanted to say. She’d done her best, damn it. With thousands of warriors she’d held off tens of thousands. Who could ask for more than that? The army wasn’t here, the damn traitors. The Antinium should have been.\nBut she’d failed, even though she was always going to fail. The Watch had never been meant to protect the city from siege. There were over four thousand in the city that held over a hundred thousand civilians. They were able to quell fights, catch [Thieves], stop [Bandit] raids—\nBut never an army. And especially not an army of the dead.\nHow many were there? Thousands. Tens of thousands. They kept getting back up. The living became the dead, and the dead refused to die. Stab wounds didn’t slow them. Fire melted their skin but had to crack their bones before they stopped. Beheading didn’t slow some skeletons, and the Crypt Lords could kill scores before they were brought down.\nIf. If the walls had been held, the Watch would have prevailed. If they had held the first few streets instead of fighting in every damned alleyway, they would have held the line.\nIf she’d let Relc try to kill Skinner, they might have pushed the undead out of the city. And if the Antinium had joined them, they might have won.\nThey were still fighting. Ksmvr’s Soldiers guarded several streets leading to their Hive. More warriors stood guarding the sloping tunnel into the earth, but none had joined the Watch. They were all back, protecting their Queen.\nAnother group of undead ran down the street. Zevara gulped down more air.\nDamn him.\nDamn\nhim. She’d counted on the Antinium. They were what had been needed, but he’d refused to send them out. The Hive’s Soldiers and the Workers would have made all the difference. They could field far more than three hundred if they needed to, but Ksmvr had refused. He was heartless. Not at all like his predecessor.\nA Ghoul bounded ahead of the running zombies and skeletons. Too fast. Zevara raised her sword and slashed at its chest. The dead woman stumbled, but then raised a hand. Too quick, and her sword was caught on bone.\nZevara opened her mouth and exhaled. Fire ignited in her lungs and spilled out her mouth. It burned the air, the dead, and even her. It was her ancient birthright, but it was not hers.\nThe world greyed out and spun as Zevara stumbled. The Ghoul was lurching back, screaming and clawing at her ruined face, but then she lunged forward. A spear tip punctured the tip of her head, and she fell down.\nSomeone was at Zevara’s side. The Watch Captain felt a huge arm helping her up.\n“Careful, Captain Z. You’re running low on air.”\nZevara gasped and shook Relc’s hand off. She tried to inhale air, but her breath was coming in short gasps. She gasped and clawed at her throat. She could barely breathe, but she had to. She spat fire again, and a crowd of the undead went up in flames.\nCoughing. Gasping. It was pain, and she couldn’t\nbreathe\n. Zevara stumbled backwards as the undead seized the lull in the deadly blasts of fire and surged forwards.\nRelc stepped forwards, spear blurring. He stabbed two zombies in the chest with blinding speed, pivoted, punched a skeleton down, and then raised his spear as another zombie lurched at him.\n“[Triple—]!”\nThe zombie’s head\nexploded\nas Relc’s spear struck three times at once. The Drake caught a bit of flesh in his open mouth and gagged on the rest of what he’d been about to say. He spat, coughing, and whirled his spear around.\nMore guardsmen rushed forwards, and Zevara stumbled backwards. She’d given them all the time to rest she could. Any more and she would stop breathing, she knew.\nShe gasped for more air and then raised her voice. She had to know.\n“Tkrn. How are the others doing?”\nThe guardsmen fought in front of her, a thin line of weary soldiers, blades and armor covered in gore. Zevara looked around.\n“…Tkrn?”\nThe Gnoll was nowhere to be seen. She remembered she had stopped getting his reports. Zevara tried to remember where she’d seen him last. Running down a street to deliver a message? She shook her head.\nGone. They were all gone. Or going.\nRelc fell back, cursing as the undead pushed forward. The thin red line grew redder and fell back as the undead pushed forwards. And this street was not alone.\nAcross the city, guardsmen fell back as the barricades broke. Ghouls raced over the rooftops, too many to be stopped by the few arrows and spells coming from below. They raced towards the streets where the citizens of Liscor were guarded by the wounded, sensing their prey was helpless.\n“We’re out of healing potions.”\nTkrn appeared out of the chaos, limping to tell Zevara that as the Watch fell back another street. She just nodded at him. What else was there to say?\n“Fall back towards Market Street. We’ll make a stand there.”\nHe nodded as the guardsmen ran or carried each other past Zevara. Relc brought up the rear, spear still blurring with speed. But even he was slowing down. Exhaustion was doing what all the undead could not.\n“Relc. Can you…?”\nHe grinned at her. Everyone was running backwards—but the undead were so\nfast—\nhe came to a halt.\n“Leave it to me. Just save a spot for me when I get back, huh?”\nShe nodded and ran with her guardsmen. Back, back again. Relc didn’t need to say anything. Both she and he felt it.\nA single Drake turned in the street, and a Wight hesitated. The [Spearmaster] stood there as a hundred undead poured towards him. Holding them for a moment so the Watch could regroup.",

    "text": "Selys Shivertail was a Level 1 [Soldier]. She had been trained, once, as an adventurer. She knew how to fight with her claws, and she had been mentored by great warriors. Heroes of her species, even.\nBut she had given that dream up as a girl. Now—she regretted it. Regretted every second of not having a Skill greater than [Swift Strike].\n“[Swift Strike]! S-swift—”\nShe tried to use the Skill again, but she could only do it once every five minutes. Far, far too little for this battle. She swung instead and cut a pale monster lightly on the chest. It kept coming, and the spears of Drakes and Gnolls around her forced it back. Selys felt ashamed she’d been showing off to Erin. It was one thing to surprise her friend. But she was not ready for battle.\n“\nWight! Kill the Wight!\n”\nHer arms were shaking with exhaustion as she fought with the civilians alongside the Watch. There were [Hunters], Drakes and Gnolls who had experience with blades skirmishing in the streets with the undead.\nKrshia had joined her Silverfangs on the rooftops, shooting Ghouls and other undead coming up at them. They were reaping dozens with each minute, precise Silverfangs from the Great Plains. Selys saw a Drake aim a crossbow up, and the bolt\nexploded\nthrough a Wight’s head.\n“\nWhere’s the Antinium? Where’s our reinforcements?\n”\nHe was screaming at the Senior Guard leading this group of volunteers. Senior Guardswoman Beilmark looked around as her partner, Jeiss, whirled his sword, slashing a zombie’s arm off and beheading a skeleton in the same move.\nThey fought well—against everything but the larger undead. Beilmark wasn’t listening. She gasped.\n“My family—”\n“Beilmark,\nfocus!\nThey’re safe!”\nJeiss and Beilmark were both parents and neither knew where their families were. Selys raised her burning arms, trying to step back into line, but the Drake with the crossbow yanked her back.\n“You’re exhausted. Grab a stamina potion and rest!”\nHe was a [Veteran] of the army. Selys thought he’d said his name was—Menolit? The Drake was missing half his tail, but not from this battle. Grimly, the Drake reloaded his crossbow, sighting for stronger undead.\nHe saw one coming their way and screamed.\n“\nCrypt Lord! Run! Run!\n”\nIt came at them in a lumbering run. This one was on all fours, and a huge head of eyeballs stared down at them past two maws of bone-teeth. Menolit fired—and his crossbow did not a thing to slow it down.\n“Jeiss!”\nThe Watch’s finest [Swordsman] tried to confront the monster alone as Beilmark swung a club left and right, knocking down zombies running past the monster. Jeiss lunged—and his blade cut in a zig-zag motion.\n“\n[Cross Slash]. [Swiftsilver Riposte]—\n”\nHe drew back, tail swinging wide as he stepped out the way of an arm—but the Crypt Lord opened its mouth and vomited that poison. Jeiss had to break off his chain of strikes—and he stumbled. With exhaustion? With wounds—\nA limb the size of Selys’ body hit the Drake, and he went crashing backwards. Beilmark grabbed him as the Crypt Lord advanced again—and she dragged the screaming Drake back.\n“\nBones broken.\nGet to—get to—”\nAn apartment was sheltering some frantic fighters trying to get in. They had lost their protective cordon. Now—Selys saw frightened faces within windows slamming them shut as monsters began to claw on the residential street. The Crypt Lord was lumbering at them.\n“\nGet indoors! Open up! Hold them off until help comes! Barricade the doors—inside, now!\nIt’ll smash through everything!”\nMenolit was shouting at the others. He grabbed Selys’ arm—but neither one had time to get inside. The door was locked—and the Crypt Lord was coming.\nZevara and Relc were fighting down another street. Selys whirled—and the Crypt Lord came to a shambling halt. It stared at her, and she wondered if her wavering sword was scaring it.\nThen she saw the bulbous, rotten eyes focus on someone coming their way. A short Drake leaning on a spear—and a tall figure that Selys recognized. For only one person had…rabbit ears.\n“Dead gods and Ancestors. At\nlast.\n”\nMenolit sagged against a door. Selys didn’t answer him—Beilmark looked up and groaned in relief. But all Selys said was—\n“\nGrandmother?\n”\nHer heart squeezed with worry, but the Drake holding the spear ignored Selys but for a single motion with her claw.\nOne side.\nThen the Guildmistress of Liscor’s Adventuring Guild nodded to the furred man with rabbit ears. Liscor’s only Courier leapt into the sea of undead, and his fists blurred as he punched the head\noff\na zombie. He kicked a skeleton into pieces as the Crypt Lord spat at him—but he was gone in a second.\nHawk the Hare and Tekshia Silverfang advanced as the [Spearmaster] of Liscor, one of two in the entire city, lowered her stance. She faced the Crypt Lord side-on.\n“[Spear Art: Tree Limb’s Reach].”\nHer jab with the short-spear in her arms\nelongated,\nand the enchanted blade struck the Crypt Lord as it lumbered forwards. The spear’s tip burst into flames, and the monster lit on fire.\nIt still came on, and Hawk\nkicked\nit from one side, making the beast stumble.\n“[Endless Spear Flurry].”\nSelys’ grandmother stabbed and stabbed and\nstabbed.\nEight, seventeen—Selys couldn’t count how many times she hit the Crypt Lord as it slowed, bursting into flames as her enchanted spear hit it. Then the Drake was leaping back, nimbly—before she clutched at her back. She strode back, leaning on her spear, panting.\nThe Crypt Lord tried to follow her and Hawk as the Beastkin disengaged, wiping gore off his fists. But it was burning—burning—\nThe streets cheered as the monster fell. But Tekshia just marched up to Selys and grabbed her granddaughter’s arm.\n“You’re alive. Good.\nBlock the streets!\nIs Jeiss alive? You idiot, we need you intact!”\n“Guildmistress—”\n“\nBack to the barricades!\n”\nMenolit shouted, stirring everyone from their stupor. The Drakes and Gnolls rushed back as he bowed, deferentially, to one of Liscor’s highest-level fighters.\n“Guildmistress Tekshia, will you help us here?”\n“\nCan’t.\n”\nHawk was the one who replied. He wiped sweat from his forehead and grimaced as he got blood and fluids all over his fur. The two of them were panting.\n“We’re fighting street-to-street against Crypt Lords. We have to go. Selys, stay here with Beilmark. If this street is overrun…run into the Hive or find a cellar.”\nSelys’ grandmother was grim. Hard as stone even now—but her claw was tight on Selys’ arm. The Drake [Receptionist] wanted to cry.\n“Grandmother—”\n“I have to go.”\n“Are we going to be alright?”\nTekshia was already striding down the street. She looked back at Selys and then jerked her head. A\nflash\nof light made Selys look up.\n“Guildmistress Alonna is holding them on another street. The Mage’s Guild, Runner’s Guild—\nkeep fighting.\nWhere are the Antinium?”\nShe looked for answers, but Jeiss, drinking a potion, just looked up bleakly. Tekshia gazed at him and then raised her spear.\n“The Walled Cities were right about the Hives, then. It doesn’t matter. The Necromancer never took the city.\nTo arms.\nKeep fighting!”\nShe began to run. Selys turned and ran back up the street as Hawk bounded after the Guildmistress. All of Liscor was fighting—there were [Mages] flinging spells down with the Gnolls, now. But\nwhere were…?",

    "text": "The guardsmen met a larger force holding the entrance to Market Street. The burned out road had been torn up again, this time so that stalls and doors could be turned into another barricade. The Drakes and Gnolls who held this spot were exhausted, wounded, but the dead clogging the street were a testament to their will to fight.\nZevara took to the front of the line and looked back over her guardsmen. She knew she had to speak, to give them hope, a reason to keep fighting. She just had nothing left to say.\nA voice raised above the shouting and ever-present noise in the distance. A calm, emotionless tone.\n“Watch Captain Zevara. I must speak with you.”\nZevara turned and saw Ksmvr. The Prognugator of the Antinium strode towards her, two Soldier Antinium at his side.\nHis exoskeleton had been crushed on one of his arms, and something had torn open his side. A gauze binding had already turned dark green with blood, but he was otherwise unharmed.\nOne of the Soldiers limped as he walked, and Zevara saw his left foot had been half torn off. But the Soldier did not cry out or show any sign of distress. They halted before her, and Ksmvr nodded as if nothing was urgent in the world.\n“Watch Captain Zevara. I regret that we must part ways now.”\nShe stared at him.\n“\nWhat?\n”\n“This battle comes too close to the Hive. I must pull back the Soldier Antinium from the streets to better guard the Hive. I tell you this as a matter of courtesy.”\nZevara struggled for words. The only reason they’d held on for so long was that the Soldiers were blocking off several streets. Without them—\n“Coward.\nAll of Liscor is fighting! Guildmasters are in the streets—\nthe Free Hive swore to fight with us! We took you in when every city in Izril refused! You fought with us against Az’kerash!”\nTkrn howled at Ksmvr. The Antinium flicked his gaze towards the Gnoll and then away dismissively.\n“I regret this decision. But I must prioritize my Hive. I hope you understand. Your duties are similar to mine in nature, Watch Captain Zevara.”\nShe stared at him. Tkrn was growling, but she put a hand on his shoulder.\n“I understand.”\nKsmvr nodded.\n“Good. I wish you—”\n“I understand that you’re a coward and a fool.”\nKsmvr paused. Zevara raised her voice as the Watch around her looked around.\n“We’ve fought and bled for this city and your blasted\nHive.\nIf we fall here, everyone dies! But you won’t even give us more than a handful of Soldiers! Don’t you realize what’s happening? Or is your damned\nQueen\nnot aware of what’s happening?”\nThe air around Ksmvr and the two Soldier Antinium froze. His hands touched at his sword hilts.\n“My Queen completes her duties. As do I. Insults to her name—”\n“Eggs\nrot\nyour damned Queen!”\nZevara shouted at Ksmvr. She pointed at the destroyed streets and ruined buildings.\n“We’ve kept Liscor safe! We’ve held up our end of the bargain—you Antinium swore to protect this city from attack! And where are you when we need you!?”\nKsmvr paused.\n“I must protect my Hive.”\n“Liscor will\nfall!\n”\n“Liscor may. But the Hive shall never be taken, even if a hundred thousand undead should attack.”\nWhat was worse, Zevara believed him. She cursed him, but Ksmvr remained impassive. He shook his head.\n“Say what you will. But the Queen’s safety is—”\n“\nZevara!\n”\nRelc shouted behind her desperately. A Crypt Lord had appeared down the street, from the wrong side. He must have broken through somewhere else. Guardsmen streamed towards him, shouting as Relc held off the undead coming from the other direction.\nZevara cursed and turned towards Ksmvr, but the Antinium was already striding away. She opened her mouth and then closed it. There was no point in wasting her breath.\nThe Captain of the Watch stared bitterly at Ksmvr’s back. She longed to plant a sword in it or strike at the Antinium, but that would just see her dead sooner. Instead, she turned. Drakes and Gnolls were already fighting the Crypt Lord as he spat black blood at them, slicing at them with claws made of broken bone.\nZevara raised her sword and ran back towards the fighting.\nFor the last time.",

    "text": "“Erin.”\nFor a moment, Erin thought someone else was shaking her. When she looked up into the dark eyes and saw the four arms of the Antinium, she remembered someone else.\n“What?”\nThe Worker pulled her upright.\n“You must not sleep. Here.”\nHe shoved something at Erin. She took it and stared at the red liquid. A potion…? A healing potion. Hers. That was right. Hers. She’d—bought it after that day.\n“Drink.”\nThe bottle was at her lips. Erin swallowed, grimaced, and felt life returning. She was tired. So tired that the world seemed to call her back to sleep. But the potion made her live.\nShe got to her feet. The Worker helped her up, and she saw he was wounded. He was missing an antenna and two fingers on one of his right hands. His carapace was broken in places, but when she offered him the potion, he shook his head.\n“Drink.”\nShe did, finishing the foul liquid and feeling life return with every gulp. Erin threw the bottle across the room and struck a skeleton in the face as it sought to climb in. It slowed the creature long enough for another Worker to behead it with an axe.\nErin looked at the Worker who had given her the potion. It seemed silly, with the undead clawing at the walls and howling outside, but she had to say it.\n“I’m sorry. I’ve forgotten your name.”\n“Bird. I am Bird.”\nHe nodded at her. Erin nodded back.\n“I guess this is it, then.”\n“We will protect you until the end.”\n“Which is now.”\n“Yes.”\nShe paused. Erin’s head was still spinning, but she looked around and saw only the dead. The undead, but also fallen Workers. Death.\nCrimson light was what she saw by. Skinner’s glowing red eyes lit up the inn brighter than the light from the moon. Bird had taken his place by one of the windows, a sword in his hand, a buckler in another.\n“There are few undead left. Many are moving towards the city.”\n“But that thing is out there.”\n“Yes. It is close.”\nErin peeked outside. She could see Skinner, his massive, obscene frame a shadow around the two red spotlights in the darkness. A guard of undead stood around him, silently waiting in the darkness.\n“He’s waiting.”\n“Yes.”\nBird nodded again. Erin looked at the undead. They were still bashing at the doors, the walls, trying to climb through the windows as the seven other Antinium moved around the room, slicing off limbs and bashing heads.\nThe inn’s walls were protecting them, for the moment. But Erin knew it wouldn’t last.\n“We’ve got to go. They’ll tear this place down around us if we stay.”\nErin walked into the kitchen. She had one jar of acid left. She took it. Bird grabbed her arm as she walked towards the door. The Worker stared at her.\n“It is death out there, Erin Solstice.”\nShe nodded. The darkness was scrabbling against the inn, breaking in piece by piece. She saw glowing eyes, fangs, baleful malice. It felt like she was dreaming again. A dark dream from which she’d soon wake. But the Antinium…if this were a nightmare, why were they so beautifully brave?\n“Yeah. But it’s death everywhere.”\nHe paused, staring at her face. Another Worker turned.\n“Better to place the enemy in check than suffer it yourself.”\nErin blinked at him and then grinned.\n“Right.”\nShe opened the door. A zombie stared at her in surprise, arm raised to hammer at the wood again. Erin threw a jar of acid in his face, and he staggered back, screaming. She was nearly out of acid. She’d rained it all down on Skinner and the other undead.\nShe had a knife in one hand. It was sharp. Erin held it in her hand and thought she was dreaming. She stepped around Knight’s body, heart beating faster and faster. The knife was slippery in her hand.\nSkinner looked at her, eyes projecting fear. Erin gritted her teeth.\n“Go to hell.”\nShe ran out the door, and the eight Antinium followed her. Erin stabbed a zombie in the face, punched him, and looked up as Skinner’s massive hand flattened the undead Gnoll. Two glowing eyes stared down at her.\nShe raised the kitchen knife.\n“Come on. Let’s end this.”",

    "text": "Ksmvr strode through the streets as the noise of battle receded into the dull roar of sound around him. He thought as he moved, considering all that was occurring and would occur.\nZevara and the guardsmen would soon fall. Perhaps the citizens in Liscor would make a stand. It was possible they might prevail—the undead horde’s numbers had thinned. But they were still a danger.\nDuty towards Liscor and the bargain with Liscor obliged the Hive to send Soldiers to defend it. But as Prognugator, Ksmvr was able to determine whether such actions were wise. And with the Queen still occupied by the Rite of Anastases, he had determined her safety was paramount.\nZevara had cursed him. Shouted at him. Her anger was understandable, but there was nothing Ksmvr could do. His actions were the only sound choice.\n…Weren’t they? No, of course they were.\nThey were logical. He knew that. The Queen had to be protected, especially when carrying out the Rite. He was quite clear in the priorities he had been given. Her life and the well being of the Hive were far more important than the agreement made with the city of Liscor.\nHe spoke to one of the Soldiers accompanying him. To speak to one was to speak to all.\n“Pull all Soldiers back. The streets are meaningless. We must protect the Hive.”\nThe Soldier didn’t respond, but Ksmvr could feel the other Antinium abandoning their positions at the street entrances. They would retreat to the Hive, guarding both entrances within the city.\nThere were three entrances to the Hive, only two of which were known to the Council of Liscor. The third remained outside the city, buried by several tons of dirt. It could be easily excavated, but the undead had not located that entrance as of yet.\nKsmvr continued to consider the siege as he stood at the entrance to the tunnel, watching the streets for the undead as Soldiers ran past him into the Hive. The Antinium had food and supplies for at least a month of continuous operation, which made things simple. The creature that had appeared with the undead was still at large outside the city, but it had shown little interest in the Antinium.\nRegardless of the outcome above, Ksmvr estimated that the Queen would be finished with her task by the end of the night. Then he could request further orders. If she wished the city to be cleansed, the Soldiers were fully capable of doing so. Otherwise, the Hive could easily be sealed off.\nShe might be angry. But he had done the most practical thing in lieu of orders. She would understand that, right?\nKsmvr did not worry about his Queen’s reaction to his decisions. He did\nnot\nworry. He had fulfilled his highest priority, even if it meant sacrificing lesser commitments towards the city. She would understand, would she not? She had given him no other directives.\n“The city is expendable. The rogue Aberrations are of little concern and may be hunted down in time. The innkeeper—”\nHe hesitated. She was valuable. The city was valuable. But—\n“The Hive is all. The Queen is all.”\nShe would understand. He dared not risk her safety by reducing the Soldiers protecting her. She had given\nexplicit\ninstructions not to be disturbed at any cost. At any cost. He was following orders.\nAnd he\nhad\nsecured the individual known as Pawn. That was quite an achievement. Ksmvr remembered what the former Worker had said and shifted. He had been…unsure how to respond to Pawn’s words, as close to disloyalty as they had seemed.\n“My judgment is not in error. My logic is sound.”\nReassured, Ksmvr nodded again. The last of the Soldiers were about to enter the Hive. But suddenly, they paused. And stopped.\nKsmvr stared as one of the Soldiers seemed to glance up at the sky, listening. And then, suddenly, he turned around and began to run back down the street.\n“You. Halt!”\nThe Soldier halted as Ksmvr strode towards him. The Prognugator held one hand on his sword’s hilt as he stopped a few feet away from the errant Soldier.\n“What are you doing? I ordered you to return to the Hive and guard the entrance.”\nThe Soldier stared at Ksmvr silently. Of course, he couldn’t respond, but Ksmvr sensed no difference in the Soldier’s thoughts. He was following orders. Following orders, but whose? Ksmvr hadn’t ordered—\nSomething brushed past the Prognugator. Ksmvr whirled, but it was another Soldier. And not just one.\nSuddenly, the massive Antinium warriors were streaming out of the Hive’s entrance again. Ksmvr whirled.\n“What are you doing? What is happening?”\nThey ran past him silently. He turned and saw them running into the city. Even as he watched, they began charging towards the undead.\n“What…?”\nA hand tapped Ksmvr politely on the shoulder. The Antinium turned—\nA fist crashed into his face. The chitin on his cheek\ncracked\nwith a loud sound. Stunned, Ksmvr fell down, hands grasping at his swords.\nUndead attack? Here already? Aberration? Ab—\nKsmvr was Prognugator of the Antinium. He had been born to war, and so he drew both swords and daggers even as he rolled. He could not die. His life was important; he led the Hive in his Queen’s absence. But he froze as he looked up.\nThe world was different. Ksmvr felt it. In an instant, his reality changed. He looked up and knew. He felt his Queen’s anger; he sensed her ire in his mind. She had returned. She had completed the Rite. And he—\nHe stood above Ksmvr.\n“\nYou.\n”\nThe world began to shift.",

    "text": "Selys had never killed with a sword. She had been trained by Tekshia and her uncle, Zel, but never actually taken a life. Undead…undead were close enough.\nHow many had she beheaded today? Eight? Twelve? Her grandmother had told her she wouldn’t understand what it was to be a warrior until she took a life. She wouldn’t level until she had placed her life on the line and gambled with it.\nToday, Selys Shivertail understood.\nThe Drake staggered back and watched as the zombie fell, the hilt sticking out of his stomach.\nThe female Drake felt sick. But Krshia yanked the sword out of the dead Human’s body and handed it back to her. The Gnoll had the experience with this.\n“Have you leveled?”\nSuch an odd question to ask as Selys’ arms burned, as the city was filled with fighting—but the Gnoll’s eyes were deadly sharp. If Selys leveled—maybe she’d be stronger. She surely would—\nBut there was no time to sleep, even a second. Selys shook her head.\n“Not—”\nShe couldn’t breathe. So Krshia lifted her bow, shot an arrow, and grinned as she reached for another.\n“Maybe after the battle ends, then, eh?”\nHer fingers scraped her quiver, and the Gnoll woman looked down.\nEmpty.\nKrshia’s smile winked out. She looked around, then ran back, cursing, calling for arrows.\nAfter the battle ends?\nThat assumed they were going to live.\nIt didn’t seem likely. Selys was behind the main line of guardsmen Zevara commanded, but already, the undead had attacked their spot twice. They were everywhere. Overrunning the streets.\n“We’re going to die.”\nKrshia smacked her on the head. Selys gaped as her hand flew to cover her head, but the Gnoll just snorted at her. She had been forced to descend to the streets—there were undead swarming over the roofs now, and half the city was overrun—the population squeezed into the other half behind the fighters. Or dead and moving upon their friends and family.\n“Save your weeping for when you are dead, yes? We are not done.\nFight.\nFight until all is lost. If only my kin had come from—”\nBut all\nwas\nlost. More undead were struggling at the barricades, fighting to break through. It was only a matter of time.\nPart of Selys wanted to throw down her sword and wait for death. But it would be a terrible death, she knew. She wouldn’t even die at the end of it. So she raised her blade awkwardly, waiting for the end. If she’d only been an adventurer, leveled in another class—\nA voice. A shout. Selys turned, raising the sword. She’d long since run out of arrows. But it wasn’t another attack. Tkrn ran down the street, waving the axe in his hand. He was running at a sprint, but his eyes were open wide. And he was—smiling?\n“The Ants! The\nAntinium are coming!\n”\nSelys looked at Krshia. It couldn’t be. They’d retreated. But now, another guardswoman had taken up the call.\n“The Black Tide marches!”\n“The Soldiers are fighting in the streets!”\nWildfire ran through Selys’ veins, giving her new hope. It couldn’t be. But then she saw them. Shapes. Moving out of the darkness. Not one. Not two. A moving mass. An endless stream of bodies.\nThe Antinium. They came in a wave, and Selys was reminded of the Antinium Wars. She remembered the same shouts she had heard as a child.\nSo again, the Antinium came in a wall of bodies. Beetle shells, insect eyes—mandibles shining under the moonlight and torchlight. An army without end or fear.\nSoldiers ran down the street. They crashed into the line of the undead even as Selys watched, gaping. First twenty Soldiers filled the street, rushing at the enemy, and then fifty. A hundred. Thousands.\nAnd they were not alone. Ksmvr, the Prognugator, was among them. He slashed at a zombie with his daggers, and suddenly, a Worker was next to him. The smaller Antinium seized the dead zombie and bore him down, and two more were suddenly next to Ksmvr, stomping at the dead Drake until it was paste.\nSoldiers\nand\nWorkers flooded out of the tunnel, an endless stream of black bodies. But that wasn’t all. The ground and streets began to\nripple,\nand hands thrust out of the stones. The undead paused, and then a huge spade-like hand seized a zombie and dragged it into the earth. A Soldier Antinium rose out of the ground and finished ripping the undead woman apart.\nThe undead in the street hesitated. They were an army without fear, an endless tide of death that bowed to neither pain nor exhaustion. They would fight on even when they had lost arms or legs. They were pitiless, emotionless killers. But that was the nature of the Antinium as well.\nOut of the tunnels. Out of the darkness. Workers raced next to huge, thundering Soldiers. They didn’t even slow down as the first group of undead appeared in front of them. The first Soldier smashed bodily into a Ghoul, knocking the smaller, dead Gnoll down. He didn’t pause but ran on. The dead Gnoll struggled to get up, but a Worker trampled him. And then another. The stream of Antinium did not cease.\nA crowd of zombies met a Soldier. He ripped into them, shovel-like hands punching, gouging their weak flesh. Workers swarmed over another zombie, ripping, pulling him apart from every direction.\nA Crypt Lord raised a clawed hand to shield itself. A Soldier leapt from a rooftop, plunging thirty feet to smash its knee into the Crypt Lord’s face. Bone and flesh gave way as the Soldier began tearing the larger undead apart. The Soldier stood up, carapace covered in steaming black blood. His right leg was shattered from the impact, and green blood oozed around the broken black carapace. He took two halting steps forward, smashed a skeleton to the side, and then collapsed.\nThe Workers and Soldiers paid no attention to the fallen Soldier. They surged around and over him, rampaging through the ranks of the undead, fighting with mindless fury.\nThe guardsmen and warriors in the streets stared. Hundreds of black bodies ran through the streets, killing, pounding,\ntearing\n.\nThe Antinium. They had come out of the Hive, leaving it practically undefended. They fought, overrunning the undead with a furious advance so fast that even the Crypt Lords seemed unnerved by the attacking insects. But why? Why\nnow\nwhen they had waited so long to—\nKrshia pulled Selys out of the way as a group of Soldiers thundered past them. They barely noticed the Drakes and Gnolls. But one of them was leading the charge. Ksmvr paused as, ahead of them, Zevara blocked his way.\n“You! What’s happening?”\nThe Drake stared at the Prognugator, but he shook his head. Selys saw the Antinium had cracked the chitin around his face somewhere. He looked—confused. She heard him raise his voice.\n“We are attacking. We will drive the undead out of the city.”\n“\nWhat?\n”\nThe look Zevara gave Ksmvr was incredulous, and she wasn’t alone. Selys had heard the Antinium had called all the Soldiers back. So why had he changed his mind?\nKsmvr shook his head helplessly.\n“I did not order it.\nI\ndid not. The Queen did not either. He—”\n“Who?”\n“He has gone to Erin Solstice with many Soldiers.”\n“\nWho?\n”\nRelc ran past Selys, his scales streaked with blood and grime. Selys grabbed at him. Relc nearly threw her off before he stopped.\n“Relc? What’s happening? Why are the Antinium fighting\nnow?\n”\nHe looked at her, wild-eyed. Selys took a step back. She had known Relc for a long time, but she’d never seen him look like that. His scales were grey. He pointed.\n“I saw him. I saw—he was leading them.”\n“Who was? Relc?”\nThe Drake didn’t answer. He sagged, staring at the Antinium as they filled the streets, fighting. He whispered, so softly only Selys and Krshia heard it.\n“He’s back.”",

    "text": "This was how it ended. In the last hours of the night, Erin fought outside of her inn, the undead and the Antinium mixing into a blur. She stared up at Skinner and saw death and horrors in his face. She raised a kitchen knife, a tiny weapon, and vowed in her heart to hurt him before she died.\nThis was how it started.\nSkinner grabbed for Erin. She ducked and stabbed at his arm. Her blade cut a few inches into his dead skin and stopped.\nErin rolled out of the way as the hand came back. It still caught her a glancing blow, but the red spot didn’t touch her, didn’t steal her skin. It had taken two Workers already. Their carapaces had been torn away by Skinner and tossed to the ground.\nA Worker caught Skinner’s hand. He knocked the Antinium away, but three more gripped his arm and stopped it. Skinner raised his other hand, and Erin threw the jar of acid.\nThe acid splashed on his face, and he\nshrieked\n. The sound went through her bones. She covered her ears as he clawed at his face, and the Antinium did likewise.\nBut something moved despite the ear-piercing sound. Toren ran out of the darkness and leapt towards Skinner, dagger in hand. He leapt onto Skinner’s face and began stabbing wildly. Skinner tried to shake his head, but he had no neck.\nHis eyes. Those crimson eyes. Toren clung to Skinner’s face, wriggling into the sunken sockets, tearing and cutting with his dagger as the giant creature tried to shake him free.\nAgain, Skinner\nscreamed\nand, this time, ripped Toren away with a huge chunk of flesh. He hurled the skeleton aside.\nToren fell away with something red in his hands. But no blood. Skinner\nhowled\nand struck after him with a massive hand, but Toren was already gone.\nOne of Skinner’s eyes was gone. In its place, a huge crater of dead flesh was all that remained. Dead flesh.\nIt was as if all Skinner was made of were just flesh. There had to be bones or muscles or—or\norgans\n. But all Erin had seen as the Workers and she had carved bits out of the creature was skin.\nSomething struck her from behind. She turned, and a zombie bared rotten teeth, biting at her. Erin struck at him with her knife, but it wasn’t good for killing something already dead. It glanced off bone, and she screamed as the zombie grabbed towards her face.\nA blue hand reached out and pulled the zombie backwards. A Ghoul—a long-dead Human with blue, moldy skin—pulled the zombie back.\nErin blinked. The Ghoul tore off the zombie’s head and then rushed at another skeleton. The group of the undead tore into their allies.\n“What the—?”\nAbove her, Skinner was still clutching at his face. He was feeling at his eyes, as if he couldn’t tell one was missing. As his fingers touched the gaps, he\nshrieked\nagain. His ruined face turned towards Erin.\nSkinner swung at Erin, and she dove to one side. She scrambled to her feet and threw the knife in her right hand. It caught a Ghoul in the eye, and it fell back as a Worker dug into Skinner’s side. The Antinium dug at the hard, dead flesh like it dug at dirt, pulling away huge layers and pieces as Skinner thrashed and tried to reach the Worker. But they were too close, too hard to grab at.\nMore undead ran around Skinner, fighting Erin and the Antinium. But something was happening. Half of them seemed to be trying to kill the other half. Even as Erin watched, two skeletons bore down a Ghoul that had a sword stuck through its belly.\nErin seized the sword and dragged it out. It was heavy and unwieldly in her hands, but she hacked at Skinner’s arm with it. Bits of dead flesh flew everywhere.\nSkinner backed up. He was trying to shield his body, but the Workers were everywhere, and the Human girl kept coming.\nIt shouldn’t be like this. She should be cowering. The Antinium should be dead. And his own undead had turned against him. It was all wrong.\nBut the girl ignored his fear. The dead had no minds to torment with horrors, and the Antinium were fearless. Skinner could only crush them, struggling to catch the Workers and undead.\nHe was just a slothful, hulking thing. He had no legs. He didn’t even have good hand-eye coordination. It was only his hands, his flaying touch and his aura of fear that were the threats. And Erin had come far. She refused to run.\nShe plunged the sword into Skinner’s arm. Deep. Nearly to the hilt. She hit something—something besides dead flesh. Skinner\nhowled\nin agony.\nHe backhanded her, and Erin flew. She actually felt herself lift into the air before she hit the ground so hard she forgot everything for a second. When she looked up, he was raising a hand to squash her.\nShe rolled out of the way just in time. The hand\nsmashed\ndown, and she grabbed at it. There was no time to think. As the arm lifted again and Skinner searched for Erin, she leapt onto its head. The grotesque layers of flesh cushioned her, and she tried not to vomit.\nShe climbed the dead flesh, feeling it, slick and horribly cold beneath her skin. Erin raised the sword and stabbed down into Skinner’s head, clumsily sawing and hacking with the blade.\nSkinner\nshrieked\nagain. And only now, touching him, did Erin feel the vibrations coming from\ninside\n. She pushed the sword deeper and then cut again, levering out a square of compacted skin.\nBelow her, zombies began trying to pull her off. They crowded around her, but the Workers shoved them back, fighting them. Erin desperately clung to Skinner as he writhed, sawing away like she was cutting wood. She had already given herself two deep slices, but she desperately kept cutting away.\nThe friendly undead were fighting alongside the Workers now, and half were climbing Skinner as well, tearing into the large creature like she was.\nErin had just pulled another socket of flesh away when she saw something change. Instead of the putrid white and yellowed skin, something else shone in the moonlight.\nSomething red. Erin stopped. The piece of dead skin peeled away, and something raised its head within Skinner’s body and stared at her. She stared back.\n“Oh.”\nIt was all she could say. Something\ninside\nof Skinner raised its head around the skin Erin had chopped away. Something wet and serpentine.\nA dark red, eyeless face swung towards Erin. A segmented head with two long…antennae made of flesh seemed to drop down towards her, and a fleshy mouth opened, revealing sharp teeth.\nSkinner—the real Skinner, the thing hiding in the puppet of dead flesh—slithered out of the ruined shell. Two long, whip-like tendrils followed the main body, long and thick roots of corded flesh. They were Skinner’s ‘hands’, and they were still coated with the black remains of the Worker he had seized.\nErin let go of the ruined flesh of Skinner’s face just in time. The red worm-thing lashed out, its tendrils scything through the air so fast she heard the whistling sound they made. They caught a Ghoul and cut clean through his torso, shattering bone, breaking flesh.\nA Worker caught Erin as she fell. Bird. He pulled Erin away, handing her a knife from one of his hands. Skinner was\nscreaming\nagain, the wormlike parasite emitting that high-pitched wail, only twice as loud now it was out in the open.\n“Oh god, oh god, oh god. What\nis\nthat?”\nBird shook his head as Skinner’s blind head moved back and forth, the fleshy antennae twisting around.\n“I do not know. It resembles a Flesh Worm, but larger and it is hiding in the dead skin. It is dangerous. Please. Stay back—”\nA tendril shot towards Bird. He choked, and Erin\nscreamed\nas the tendril lanced through the Antinium’s side. She cut at the tendril with the knife, and Skinner\nscreamed\nagain and pulled the tendril out. Bird collapsed on the ground, bleeding.\nErin threw the knife. It spun towards Skinner’s head, but the red worm dodged the spinning projectile effortlessly.\nTwo skeletons ran at Skinner. The red worm-creature\nhissed\nand lashed out with its tendril arms, scattering both skeletons. He cast around again and struck like a cobra.\nA zombie was lifted into the air, and his skin was removed in a sickening\nripping\nsound. Only, Erin was sure that was one of Skinner’s own monsters. The crimson worm slithered back to the layers of skin and pasted the zombie’s flesh over part of the broken skin, as if he were repairing a papier-mâché doll.\n“Do not allow it to rebuild. Kill it now.”\nErin couldn’t tell which Worker spoke. But they all ran towards Skinner at once, slashing at the huge segmented creature.\nSkinner whirled around, and its tail sent several Antinium sprawling. It seized two Antinium with its tendrils and ripped parts of their bodies away. It was impossibly\nfast\nnow, and it stabbed two more Antinium as they ran at it.\n“No!”\nErin was on her feet. She scrambled for something to throw. Acid. She had to have another jar of acid in the inn. She ran towards it, but Skinner slithered forwards and blocked the entrance. It lowered its head and\nbit\nat her.\nShe ducked. She felt the smooth, sticky body of Skinner just above her, and then it rammed her. She hit the ground, stunned as Skinner raised its head. It regarded her, two antennae probing at her face, and then raised a fleshy tendril to spear her.\nErin couldn’t scream. She just looked at Skinner and held her breath. Waiting. The fleshy appendage rose and then scythed downwards towards her neck.\nDeath came for Erin and stopped halfway. A sword cut through the air; a pair of silvery blades. They flashed together, and Skinner reeled back, screaming. Yellow, pus-like blood oozed from the cuts, splashing onto Erin as she stared. She looked around.\n“Wha—”\nSomeone was standing over her. An Antinium. But not like any she had ever seen. He had only two arms and a slim, graceful body, not like a Worker’s or a Soldier’s. In his arms, he held two swords she recognized, and he faced Skinner calmly as the red creature writhed and\nscreamed\n.\nAround Erin, black shapes suddenly appeared out of the darkness, grabbing the undead and tearing them apart. Large Soldier Antinium. They ran after Skinner as the red worm retreated. But that wasn’t what captured Erin’s gaze.\nShe was still staring at the Antinium who had saved her. He was a tall fellow. A Worker, but too big to be a regular one. Some kind of Soldier? A new kind? But—\n“Are you unharmed, Miss Solstice?”\nFor a moment, the voice was just a memory. And then Erin’s eyes widened. Memory. The Antinium tilted his head as he regarded her. Her heart froze in her chest and then began to pound wildly.\nIt couldn’t be. It was impossible. But the voice was the same. The way he talked was the same. His body was different, but he—\n“Impossible.”\n“You have fallen. Allow me to help you up.”\nShe blinked. He reached down and pulled her to her feet. She clutched at him, ignoring Skinner, the undead, and the foul-smelling pus clinging to her clothing. Everything.\n“You—you can’t be. I saw you dead. You were\ndead.\n”\nHer eyes were filling with tears. Part of her was screaming something wordless. Erin reached out, and her fingers shook as she touched the Antinium’s black carapace.\n“You—how?”\nHe smiled. Klbkch of the Free Antinium sheathed his swords and bowed to her.\n“True Antinium never truly die. And I…I have a promise to keep.”\nThe world stopped. The dark night ceased. Light filled Erin’s head. She staggered, and Klbkch caught her with one arm. She felt his cold, hard chitin on her skin. Smooth, hard carapace. An alien’s touch. An unnatural feeling.\nBut she looked up and saw a friend.\nErin stared at Klbkch. He turned his head and raised his swords. A Ghoul ran onto one of his blades while the other beheaded it. He turned to Erin.\n“It is not safe here. Remain behind me, Erin.”\nThen he turned, and this time, his swords swung not at Goblins but at a Wight, chopping through a reaching hand, spearing it through the head. Striking left, parrying a jet of bile from a Crypt Lord, sending the liquid splashing back as the silver swords moved.\nThe Slayer of the Antinium whirled the poison back, splattering the undead, and turned his head again, checking on Erin to make sure she was alright. But this time—he was not guarding her alone.\nErin was frozen there, unable to speak or even form a thought. Klbkch seemed to gesture, and two Soldiers appeared out of the darkness. They surrounded her while Klbkch gave orders.\n“Harry the undead. Pursue that creature.”\n“Oh!”\nErin stared as the Soldiers ran towards Skinner. The red, fleshy, slithering thing was trying to retreat towards its dead skin, but the Soldiers weren’t letting it. They tried to corner Skinner, but it seized a Soldier, ripped his carapace away, and slithered away from them, down a hill.\nSkinner\nscreamed\nin fury as he ran. And he was running, slithering down the incline, a freakish worm-creature from the depths of hell. But he was retreating, nevertheless. His body of skin was gone. The Soldiers chased him, pounding through the grass.\nBut they were too slow. Too slow. They’d wounded Skinner. One of his ‘hands’ was missing thanks to Klbkch’s blades, and he was bleeding and torn in a dozen places. But he was too fast. Without his body, he would get away.\n“Do not slow! The creature must not be allowed to retreat into the ruins!”\nKlbkch thundered at his Soldiers. But even Erin could see it. Skinner was too quick. And he was—it was—\nThe worm laughed. It let out a ghastly, staccato\nchittering\nthat made Erin’s skin crawl. It looked back as it wriggled away, as if taunting Erin and the others. It laughed, mocking them.\nErin saw the molted flesh it had abandoned still had pieces of metal clinging to it? Armor? It was vulnerable, now.\nSkinner had lost his undead. The Antinium were retaking the city. It had lost its\nskin—\nbut the flesh-thing was still mocking them. It could rebuild it all. If it got away—\nErin gritted her teeth. If she had a weapon or something to throw, she would have—but it was too far away. All she could hear was that taunting, echoing laughter. That high-pitched sound. She wanted to cover her ears, but they were already splashed by blood and worse. It was so\nloud\n, so repetitive. In fact—\n“What’s that sound?”\nKlbkch cocked his head. Erin looked around. She heard something else, another high-pitched noise echoing across the plains. It wasn’t coming from Skinner. It was something else.\n“That sound. What is it?”\nIt was faint, but growing louder. It was a high-pitched sound, countless…countless\nvoices\nululating and screaming wildly.\nYiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyiyi—\nErin knew. She breathed the word.\n“Goblins.”\nThey streamed down one of the hills, countless small shapes lit by torchlight. Light glinted off their weapons and ragtag armor as they ran towards Skinner, faster than it could run. It halted, rearing up onto its serpentine body, seemingly unsure of what to do.\nAs the Goblins drew nearer, Skinner lanced out. He skewered two Goblins and ripped the skin from another, but there were so\nmany\n.\nOne of Skinner’s red, glowing eyes still shone, embedded in the carcass of flesh. That magical light seemed incredulous at the sight it beheld.\nThis?\nBut something else rolled in the depths of Skinner’s gaze. Sudden—abject terror. Erin could feel the fear. The Antinium ignored fear. And Goblins—Goblins were different. Goblins were\nalways\nafraid.\nThey swarmed the massive worm, ducking under him as he lashed out with his tendril arms. He bit and\nscreeched\n, but the Goblins screamed too, louder than him. Skinner tried to wriggle away, but he was caught.\n“No way.”\nErin breathed the words incredulously. But the Goblins came on, little green demons with eyes that flashed red in the moonlight. They were just pests. The lowest kind of monster.\nBut they were quick. And they were everywhere. For each one Skinner killed, five more were stabbing,\nbiting.\nThey were no match for Skinner. No match for the undead. But they killed the wounded, attacked from behind.\nThey were cowards like that.",

His armor was gone, though—broken by a traitor. His remaining flesh—ruined. His endless forces—to be brought down by the lowliest monster? Impossible.\nBut the Goblins stabbed and stabbed, and his vulnerable skin bled.\nHe collapsed, borne down by the weight of countless small bodies. Skinner thrashed and screamed, but the Goblins drowned out even that. They stabbed, bit, burned him with acid and with fire.\nSmall jars of acid. They smashed them on Skinner’s side, leaping away as his red skin smoked and he writhed in agony. And fire—a flaming creature of fire was dancing round Skinner, burning him, making the red worm twist as the flames seared his unprotected flesh.\nRags. From her spot on the hill, Erin saw a small Goblin controlling the fire. Her hands glowed red, and her face and body were illuminated by the flame as the spell struck Skinner again and again.\nShe raised a sword that shone like gold even though it was bronze and stabbed him in the head. Skinner screamed then, and the dead howled with him. Then, slowly, he collapsed.\nSkinner, the guardian of the Ruins of Liscor, the death of adventurers and stealer of flesh, opened his mouth to howl one last time. Rags tossed a jar of acid into his mouth, and he convulsed. She pushed the sword deeper, and his body jerked. Once. Twice.\nAnd then he was dead.\nThe dead stood still, staring at Skinner’s remains. And then, slowly, they moved. Those closest to the living fought on and died. But the others walked away. Back, out of the city, away from the inn. Towards the ruins, down the long dark corridors, into dark places. Back towards the place they had died and risen. Back towards their lair.\nBack home.\nIt was over.",

Klbkch watched her do it and saw her wipe away the tears.\nErin stood in the doorway and faced Klbkch. He looked at her and saw a girl. Perhaps a woman by some standards, but someone young. Her clothes were covered in blood and gore, and she was cut in places, bruised in others. She had been aged by violence and death and loss. But something still shone in them. Something bright.\nThere were many things Klbkch could have said. But none were quite right, quite fitting. So he said the only thing he could.\n“Greetings, Erin Solstice.

A few Goblins picking past the Shield Spiders already trying to drag the corpses into a pit-nest leapt away, screeching in alarm. Ryoka looked around for another ambush—but they just hefted their spears and armor and horsemeat and fled.\nHorsemeat?\nRyoka’s stomach lurched, and she nearly vomited as she gagged. She saw the remnants of the horses. And the Gnolls.\nThe Shield Spiders had been at them at least a day.\nRyoka turned away, then saw the smoke.\n“No. Did she do this? Did—”\nGazi the Omniscient?\nShe was nowhere to be seen. The terrifying Named-rank adventurer that Ryoka had seen pursuing the Gnolls…\nThere was no way to prove what had happened. Not now. The Gnolls were stripped of armor and weapons. Ryoka remembered the grinning warrior with the silver fang on his fur. Rometh. She looked for him—\nNothing.\nThere was just a horror of fur and blood and—insects. Spiders, competing with the Acid Flies that made the innards of the corpses\nglow.\nThe flies and spiders ignored each other. The Shield Spiders would not try to eat the deadly flies. Both offended her to her core. Ryoka stomped a tiny spider scuttling towards a furred hand matted in blood.\n“Get away from them. Get—”\nShe saw the milling cascade of limbs turn on her and ran as she heard the chittering. She would have gone back—but then she saw the smoke.\nIt rose ever higher from Liscor in the distance. She could not see the city well from the hill and valley where she had found the Gnolls.\nBut she knew where it was.\n“No. Nonono. It wasn’t her, was it?”\nThere was no way. But then—what about the Horns? Ryoka turned back to the bodies. But she couldn’t kill the spiders. If she came back, she might try to get someone to bury them. But…\n“Ceria? Calruz?”\nRyoka began to run faster. She didn’t know that someone had observed her coming through the Floodplains. A silent woman with a claymore stood miles away and watched as Ryoka ran. Ran—seeking her friends.\nBut she was too late. The day Ryoka arrived was the day after Skinner died. She arrived as the funeral pyres were still burning the undead to ash. She saw the churned earth around Liscor and a ways away—a battered building that drew her eye. Torn and damaged. But standing.\nAn inn.",

    "text": "[Innkeeper Level 18!]\n[Skill – Immunity: Alcohol obtained!]\n[Skill – Quick Recovery obtained!]\nErin didn’t know that she’d slept. She raised her head and realized she was sitting down. Dawn had come, but she had only drifted off for a second.\nThe sky was still mostly dark. But light still illuminated the grasslands. Dancing shadows. Twisting flames.\nFire.\nThe Antinium were burning the dead. All of them. They had created a huge pyre of bodies and set it alight. The terrible, suffocating smoke fanned away from the inn, but Erin’s eyes still burned. Or perhaps it was just her grief.\nThe bodies of the Workers were gone. Sometime when she hadn’t been watching, the Soldiers had taken them away. Erin had asked one of the surviving Workers—Bird—where they had gone. He told her she didn’t want to know.\nNow, Bird sat on the ground outside of the first bonfire, so vast and hot that it was baking the ground, splitting the earth and threatening to set the cold grass on fire. The heat and light reflected off his armor. Green blood had dried from terrible bites that had torn into his chest and arms.\nBut the Worker just sat there, staring up at the twisting column of smoke. It rose like some mournful creature, great and terrible and beautiful. But for the stench. Into that dark sky turning brighter with each second. Bird saw the beauty of it.\nErin did too—but it hurt too much for her to take in his simple, childish wonder. Even now, the other Workers that had lived looked up at the sky as if it could make up for that dark, horrific night. As if there were something still to believe in.\nWhat would happen to them? What came next?\nShe was afraid to ask more. Even of Klbkch. He had barely left her side all night. Now, he stood on the hill, staring down at a large shape several hundred meters away.\nErin got up and walked to his side. He turned his head slightly, but continued looking down. Erin stared at the red, elongated form of the creature that had lived in dead flesh and led an army of the dead. It was still surrounded by the Goblins that had felled it. Many had paid with their lives. But many more were claiming victory, looting the undead and milling around. They had even torn the ruined pieces of armor away and were trying to beat the scraps into tools and armor for themselves.\nSomething was different about Skinner’s body this morning. He seemed…diminished. Erin stared down as the Goblins milled around him, and then she realized what was going on.\n“Are they…\neating\nit?”\n“Yes.”\nHer stomach roiled. But Klbkch was unmoved, and so too were the Goblins. They tore into the red body of Skinner, tearing him apart, drinking the fluids and—\nShe couldn’t watch. Erin went back to her inn and threw up in the outhouse. It was still standing, at least. It needed repairs. Everything needed repairs.\nShe sat on the toilet Pawn and the other Antinium had built and rested her head in her hands. She was so tired, still. She would have given everything to sleep. But sleep was a luxury, and she owed a debt of pain.\nFirst things first. Her…level. Yes, she’d leveled up three times. Was that a lot? Probably. And she had new skills.\nThey were an [Innkeeper]’s skills. And they were worthless. Trash.\n“Shit.”\nYes. Erin glanced at the wood walls of the outhouse. Less than crap. That was how she felt about her levels and skills at the moment.\nIt felt wrong to level when her friends had died. It felt wrong to be stronger in exchange for killing things. But there was nothing Erin could do about it. She felt like vomiting or punching a hole in the wall of the outhouse. She nearly did, but stopped herself.\nErin walked back out and stood next to Klbkch. After a while, she had the courage to ask him what she couldn’t last night.\n“How many?”\nHe looked at her, and Erin wondered if he was going to lie. But after a second, he spoke again.\nShe listened to the numbers. When they were just numbers, it didn’t seem so bad. But when she stared at the bodies, it was too terrible to be counted.\nTwenty-seven Goblins lay in the grass. Too many. Even in Skinner’s last moments, he had killed with terrible ease.\nOf the thirty-two Workers that had chosen to save her, four remained. Bird, Garry, Belgrade, and Anand. They lay in her inn or sat propped up, wounds covered by some kind of sticky red substance. The Antinium had little in the way of medicine, but they were tough. They would heal.\nLess than a hundred people had died around Erin’s inn. Too many, but in the city, it had been worse, or so Klbkch told her.\n“Over two hundred guardsmen and nearly a thousand civilians perished before the Hive was mobilized. Had they broken the Watch Captain’s lines, the number would be tenfold despite our sortie. She acted very bravely.”\nShe hadn’t even known there were that many guardsmen in the city. But they’d had healing potions and armor and—it was just a number.\n“How many Antinium? Your people…?”\n“Three hundred sixty-five Soldiers and a hundred and forty-seven Workers. Nearly half again as many are wounded, but the losses were quite minimal.”\n“…Really?”\nShe couldn’t imagine that many. The number, yes. But so many…if she thought of each one being a member of her chess club, it was too many. One was too many to call\nminimal.\nYet Klbkch seemed to think it was some kind of grand victory.\nHe shrugged.\n“A war would be tenfold higher at the very least. A hundredfold. It was a small price to pay and would have been smaller still had my predecessor not erred. Had we fought alongside the Watch, we would have pushed the undead back without taking nearly so many losses. Had they held the gates, less than a hundred might have died.”\n“Why didn’t you, then? I mean—he. Ksmvr. Ksmvr…didn’t fight?”\nA pause. Klbkch clicked his mandibles softly. He made her want to hug him with all her strength, and he was simultaneously frightening. She had seen him cutting down undead after undead, and now she understood his nickname.\nSlayer.\nThis morning, he talked as if he had merely had a long night. He had—something of Gazi in him. And his voice was cold as it referred to his replacement.\n“Ksmvr believed the Queen had to be protected above all else. He withdrew all Soldiers into the Hive while she finished the Rite of Anastases.”\n“Why did he do that? What Rite?”\n“The process to revive me. It was a delicate matter that occupied the Queen’s full attention. Without her guidance, Ksmvr did what he deemed best. He chose wrongly.”\n“Oh.”\nKlbkch nodded calmly. He went on, listing the things he had to do on one hand.\n“There is much that must be done. Reparations must be made to the city. The Antinium did not honor their promise. We must rebuild, put up barriers outside the Ruins.”\n“And you’re going to do it? You’re the new Prognugator? Or does Ksmvr still have that job?”\n“He does not.”\nKlbkch shook his head as he watched a Soldier dragging a body towards the burning heap.\n“Ksmvr was a fool. He nearly cost the Hive the city, our position here and status across the continent, and…other assets. I will deal with him soon enough.”\nFor a while, Erin and the Antinium watched the dead burn. She swayed on her feet. Klbkch watched in silence.\n“Yes. Many things.”\n“Klbkch?”\n“Yes, Erin?”\n“How\ndid\nyou come back?”\n“It is called the Rite of Anastases. It is a…process which the Queen of the Antinium may undertake. It allows the dead to be reborn into a new body. A secret of the Antinium.”\n“Oh.”\nErin thought about that for a second.\n“Okay. I understand. I think. Then…does that mean you can revive the others who died?”\n“Others? Ah. You mean the individuals who were once Workers. No.”\n“Why not?”\nHe hesitated.\n“In truth, only a Prognugator would be considered…worthy of the effort and time required for such an act. Moreover, it is not something done lightly. There are consequences. I have lost ten levels in every class. A considerable setback, although my new body reduces the impact on my abilities quite significantly. And the time it took—my Queen labored for nearly two weeks without rest to restore my being.”\n“That’s a lot of work.”\n“There were other material costs as well. The Hive would not be able to support such an action more than once or twice. The others—”\n“I get it.”\nIt nearly didn’t hurt. Nearly. But it was just another cut in a heart bleeding from a thousand places.\n“They died well. I would not have expected mere—they rose above what they were. For that, I honor them.”\n“Thanks.”\nFor once, Klbkch didn’t seem to know how to reply. Erin looked at him. He was as he had been, but different.\n“What’s with the new body? Upgrades?”\nHe nodded.\n“The Prognugator role was never meant for specialized action. Moreover, it was thought that the Worker form would allow a Prognugator to blend in to reduce the dangers of assassination during times of war. This new form will greatly improve my abilities.”\n“Two arms are better than four?”\n“Yes. I am swifter, more mobile, and possess several changes to my anatomy not incorporated into other Antinium. The older design of four arms was inefficient. This new body will serve me better.”\n“Harder, better, faster, stronger, huh?”\n“That is broadly correct, yes.”\n“Okay.”\nKlbkch was watching her. Erin knew, even if he didn’t have pupils to follow her. He hadn’t really let her leave his sight since that night. She was so tired.\n“Thanks for saving me. Really.”\n“It was nothing.”\n“It was something.”\n“Yes.”\nShe looked at him. Just the same as always. And then she looked at her inn. She looked at the broken wood, at the marks of violence, and at the place where a Worker named Knight had died. She looked at the dead and the Soldiers. She remembered a half-Elf, a Minotaur, a Drake obsessed with chess, and a bunch of smiling faces.\nKlbkch saw Erin fold up and fall backwards. He tried to catch her, but she thumped back into the soft grass.\n“Miss Solstice. Are you alright?”\nErin smiled emptily as Klbkch hovered over her. She raised one hand and let it fall.\n“I’m just going to lie down for a while.”\nShe lay in the trampled grass as the Goblins feasted, listening to the dead burn.\nErin wept.",

    "text": "Selys sat in the Adventurer’s Guild, listening to Zevara argue with the guildmaster. Her grandmother. Not argue, really. Tekshia wanted to give out rewards to the people who had killed monsters. Zevara wanted her Watch to be included in that number, to hand out bonuses to them.\nTekshia told Zevara to take it up with the Council because the Adventurer’s Guild didn’t have enough funding. Zevara insisted she wanted that on top of a bonus from the Council to all the [Guards] who’d risked their lives.\nThis was background noise to Selys. She stared dreamily at her bandaged wrist and felt the healing cuts on her legs and torso burning and itching.\nEven after a day, Liscor was silent. The streets were still busy, and the people still spoke. But it was a different place. Death and destruction had taken their toll, and people still mourned.\nBut they had survived. They had all come out stronger for their ordeals. Selys was now a [Warrior] and had gained several levels in her [Hunter] class. It was a wonderful thing, especially since she hadn’t leveled in a month.\nBut she was still tired. Then the reasonable debate turned into a full-blown argument. Selys turned her head as Zevara brought something else up, and this time, Tekshia refused to even hear her out.\n“I want those Humans responsible for unleashing the undead held accountable!”\nThe Captain of the Watch was exhausted, bloody, and had saved Liscor. Selys knew her if not in person, then by reputation. She was a good leader, and she had saved countless lives during the battle with the undead. Her voice was raw, and she coughed every few words now.\nAncestor-touched. Dragon’s child.\nOldblood.\nSelys thought the words, but didn’t say them out loud. Zevara had breathed fire to hold the undead back. She was a hero. But she was wrong in this.\n“All the adventurers who went in are dead. Only a handful remain, and they’re in no condition to repay anyone for anything. They’ve suffered enough. Leave them alone.”\nThe Guildmistress of the Adventurer’s Guild in Liscor, an elderly Drake with dusky purple scales, shot back when Zevara stopped to breathe. The Drake Captain coughed a few times and glared at the old Drake, but she was unmoved. She might have bullied someone else.\nBut the old Drake had fought as well and saved just as many lives. She leaned on her staff this morning, looking tired. She’d finished three cups of tea Selys had brewed, and she barred Zevara’s way with her spear.\n“They have nothing. Nothing will be gained from blaming them, either. The Council was glad enough when they volunteered to explore the ruins. This is on their tails as much as ours.”\n“The Council wants to hold someone responsible. And if it won’t be the adventurers, it will be this Guild. You choose which one.”\nSelys winced, but her grandmother just sighed.\n“Stubborn child. If you really wish to push this—Selys!”\nSelys jumped and tried to shuffle some papers around. Her grandmother raised her voice.\n“Take Zevara to the leader of the adventurers she wants to blame so badly. Let her make her case there.”\nThat clearly wasn’t what Zevara had been expecting. The taller Drake hesitated when Selys poked her head around the corner.\n“Um. Hi. Follow me, Watch Captain.”\nShe led Zevara up the stairs and into a part of the Guild reserved for injured adventurers or those in need of a place to sleep for a night. It was a section of the second floor, only large enough to house three separate adventurers at a time. And one room was occupied.\nSelys pushed open the door carefully. Zevara’s breath caught as the door swung open to reveal the lone occupant.\nA Human sat in a white bed, staring emptily out one window. It was a bright day with clear skies in Liscor. A bit chilly given it was winter, but winter had not yet arrived, and Yvlon Byres took no notice of the temperature.\nShe paid no attention to anything at all, really.\nHalf of the skin on her face had been torn away. Her long blonde hair was ragged; her fair skin cut and marred. She stared empty-eyed through the window, sitting and looking at nothing.\nHer armor had been torn to shreds when they’d cut her out of it. Even now, Selys could remember the Human woman screaming. But now she was silent. It was little better.\n“Human.”\nYvlon didn’t move. She didn’t blink. Zevara called out a few times, but Yvlon was still. The Watch Captain hesitated.\n“If you’re going to try and shake her, you might as well give up. She doesn’t respond.”\nZevara turned towards the elderly drake as Selys rearranged the pillow around Yvlon, trying not to touch the female Human. She avoided the empty stare as well as Zevara, and her grandmother whispered.\n“She has no coin or anything else. Everything she owned was lost in the Ruins. Her comrades, her pride, her health—what more would you take from her, good Captain?”\nZevara glared down at the older Drake, lips tight, tail thrashing.\n“Someone must pay.”\n“Someone must. But I don’t believe she or any of the adventurers has enough coin to cover the costs.”\nZevara looked back at Yvlon. The adventurer sat quietly in bed, back straight, hands folded. Face scarred.\nThe Watch Captain shook her head. She had a million things to do. Relc was patrolling for any undead while the rest of the guardsmen rebuilt. She had to go through the roster of wounded and dead, focus on rebuilding the city, address the Antinium issue for the Council.\nShe turned her heel. It was pointless to waste her time here arguing with a Drake three times as old as she was. Zevara strode away and turned her head only once.\nYvlon stared into the blue sky, a few feet away and a thousand miles gone. Zevara stared into her empty eyes and left.",

    "text": "Toren sat on the roof of the inn, staring at nothing and everything at the same time. Below him, Erin pounded away with a hammer, covering up broken windows with boards. She’d banned him from helping the second time he’d put a hole in a wall.\nHe hadn’t meant to. But on the other hand, he’d meant to. Some part of Toren knew that was the only way to earn a reprieve. And he wanted one. For the first time, he wanted to stop and think.\nThe skeleton sat on the roof, staring out at the empty plains. From here, he could see Liscor in the distance. The city seemed whole, and it was rebuilding quickly, according to Erin. But much like the area around the inn, marks of the battle still remained.\nThe battle. Toren still remembered Skinner, still remembered the countless enemies and only the pure joy of battle coupled with the need to keep Erin safe. It had been glorious, liberating.\nAnd all too short.\nIt was a curious thing. He had leveled, and in doing so, he had become more. More…himself. He could think, act, feel on a level he had not previously.\nLevel 11.\nThat was what he was. It was…eight levels? Yes, a huge leap. But he had earned each one. The part of Toren that thought and remembered wondered if it was because he had wounded the large flesh-stealing creature so badly. That and the countless number of his brethren he had slain had done it.\nHe wondered how many levels the small Goblin had gained. How many levels her tribe had gained. It was meaningless, and yet it was not. Why should he care what level a Goblin was? Unless she was a threat, it was meaningless.\nBut some part of Toren wondered. And it was that part which had awakened after the battle as he had gained those levels. He had begun to think, and that was a mystery in itself. A welcome one to be sure, but vexing nonetheless.\nNow, he could ask why he obeyed. Now, he could think of Erin as a person, not just as a master. Now, he could wonder…\nThe red gemstone turned in his skeletal hands. Toren could sense the magic contained within. He had taken it from the creature of skin, plucked it away. It had powerful magic. It had fear; he understood that much. But how might he use it? Should he use it? Should he give it to Erin?\nNo. Yes. Perhaps. It was not so simple anymore. Toren studied the gemstone. It was red, darker red than crimson. The red of dried blood and death. He had taken it from Skinner; he didn’t know where its twin had gone. But one was all he needed.\nNeeded…for what exactly? Toren wasn’t sure, but he was beginning to understand. Something was calling to him. He didn’t know what yet, but he would in time. If he had more levels, he would understand more. And when he did, perhaps he would think more. Perhaps he would question more. And then when he had levelled enough—\n“\nHey, Toren!\nGet your bony butt down here and help me lift this thing!”\nA voice from below. His master’s. Or was it mistresses’? He had had a master, once. The mage called Pisces. But he was no longer a master. Was Erin a master? Or a mistress? Or was she neither? Another question.\nHe had so many. But not enough time to consider them, and Erin was beginning to yell again.\nToren got up without sighing. Skeletons didn’t sigh. But he looked at the red crimson eye in his hand. She would not want it. She would take it away. Therefore, he had thought about what to do.\nCarefully, very carefully, he opened his mouth and placed the gem inside. It was quite simple. A bit of sticky tar used for repairing the inn’s roof and it could be stored in the hollow of his skull, where brains were normally kept. That way no one would see it.\nIt was the [Tactician] part of him that suggested it, and the rest of him agreed. Toren made sure the gemstone was firmly tucked away and stuck in place before he leapt from the rooftop. He was stronger now, that was clear. Strong enough to help Erin wrestle the planks of wood into place and hold them there while she hammered nails haphazardly into the wood.\nStronger, yes, and more aware. But what would that lead to? What would he become?\nFor the first time, Toren asked these questions. And for the first time, he was curious to find out the answer.\nA bit of crimson light flashed in the blue flames of his eyes. Only for a second.",

They were important things, surely, for each person who experienced them thought of themselves as important.\nIn his hiding place in the plains, Pisces dragged away another body he had managed to save from the purging flames. It was an effort to bring them so far, but worth it. He propped the Ghoul’s headless body against a wall and studied the piece of the dead Crypt Lord that occupied most of the dirt cave. He smiled gleefully, as a child about to unwrap a present might. But he wavered a moment before he tried to copy the design wholesale.\nThere was love of death and…he stared at the Crypt Lord’s face and remembered how the undead had poured in.\n“It should be more beautiful than that. It must be. I have to prove to her why I am different. Why I am—better.”\nThat was all he said. Then he continued his studies.",

    "text": "Somehow, after that terrible night of death and carnage, the world was still turning on. Liscor even had visitors coming through the gates. The Watch was busy checking for remaining undead and helping clear the rubble, but the presence on the walls of Liscor was strong.\nIt meant it was easier to steal and cause trouble if you were a thief. Most of Liscor’s underworld criminals were inactive, though, perhaps counting how close they too had come to being slaughtered.\nYet a young woman, a Human girl, a thief—crouched in an alleyway, scarfing down baked treats she’d stolen from a bakery window. She was figuring out what she needed next. She wouldn’t have cared if the undead had killed all the filthy lizards and furry half-breeds in the city. She was starving, alone, and desperate.\nHer head only rose when a vehicle rolled past the mouth of the alley. The girl crept forwards—and her eyes went wide. She stared at the pinkest carriage she had ever seen in her life, which Drakes and Gnolls glanced up at.\nSome recognized it, yet vaguely, for it had never come to Liscor before. But the girl—she dropped one of her half-eaten rolls and ran, shouting.\n“\nMagnolia! Magnolia Reinhart! It’s me!\n”\nShe ran, waving her hands, as the carriage navigated the streets and pedestrians. The driver turned his head back—and the young woman with dyed blonde hair already revealing fiery red roots threw back a hood, lifting a hand. She expected to be recognized.\nA window rolled down, and for a second, she caught a glimpse of the woman inside.\nLady Magnolia Reinhart was speaking to the air, through a [Communication] spell so powerful that the girl couldn’t see who she was talking to. She glanced out, and the young woman saw her gaze pass absently over her face. Magnolia stared behind her—then calmly rolled the window back up.\nThe carriage accelerated. The thief ran after it, screaming now, but it just rolled away until she lost it in the streets. She only gave up when one of the Gnoll [Guardswomen] asked if something was wrong. Then she fled, cursing Magnolia’s name.",

    "text": "Ressa looked back through the one-way glass window enchanted to be proof against arrows and magic and casual observers. She had seen the young woman and recognized her.\n“She made it all the way here. That’s actually commendable. Was that—kind?”\nHer voice was careful, and the normally taciturn [Maid] looked up as Magnolia Reinhart lifted a finger. The [Lady] glanced up, and she spoke to a sulking figure in the air.\n“One moment, Teriarch. Ressa—I am speaking to an old man with difficulties in splitting his attention. Really, do you think this is appropriate?”\nThe [Maid] just folded her arms and glanced pointedly behind her where the young woman had been.\n“\nOld man?\nYou go too far, child. First, you give me orders to find people as if I were your personal [Diviner]. Then you lecture me on—”\nMagnolia muted the spell with a finger. She looked back as well, though the ‘thief’ had long vanished. Her face was…inhospitable in this moment.\nTight. She looked so pained that Ressa almost forgave her uncharitableness. The [Lady] took another deep breath.\n“That girl. What of her, Ressa? Yes, I saw her. Yes, she made it far. Commendable in some respects.”\n“She might die out here. She didn’t look like she was doing well. Theofore claims she’s mostly stealing.”\nMagnolia made a disgusted sound as she tapped her lips.\n“Has she considered working? One imagines she could.”\n“No…nor does she seem keen on speaking with any Drakes or Gnolls. But her gold’s run out.”\n“She has quite a lot on her. If I took her in, then what? She would be the most insufferable headache imaginable. To me, personally, to you…”\nRessa grimaced, and Magnolia went on. Teriarch had huffily closed the spell when he realized he was muted. Typical.\nThe carriage was slowing, and she wasn’t looking behind her. Only ahead at the two-story building they’d come to.\nThe sign was simple, ubiquitous…and Magnolia saw the driver leap out and open the door for her. But she hesitated as Ressa got out. Her eyes fixed on that sign, and she paused a second.\nAdventurer’s Guild.\nWhen she did leave the carriage, Magnolia nodded to the man standing in his prim suit, attracting stares from the Drakes and Gnolls.\n“Thank you, Reynold. I—I may take a while.”\n“Very good, Lady Reinhart. I shall take the carriage around back.”\nHe stepped back, and Magnolia looked into the guild as a [Receptionist] poked her head over the counter and saw two more [Maids] appear and hold the doors open. Selys’ jaw dropped, but Magnolia just stared inside, then turned.\n“Ressa. I have so much to do. And so little time for someone who does nothing with everything. I would rather…”\nHer gaze flitted towards the staircase as Guildmistress Tekshia herself stomped over, facing Magnolia and Ressa warily. Magnolia’s lips moved.\n“…I would rather take all my time for those who try for everything. Should I have meddled?”\nShe looked lost, a moment, and Ressa stared at her mistress in silence.\n“You let them try.”\n“Yes.”\nThat was all Magnolia said. Then she turned and smiled with a faraway look at Tekshia, and Selys, eyes wide, heard the [Lady]’s voice.\n“Guildmistress.”\n“Lady Reinhart. Is that how I should address you?”\nThe woman laughed. That laugh was fake, polite—and her eyes were still elsewhere. Above. She looked up those stairs, and Tekshia’s glance at her became knowing.\n“Oh. Are you here for your guest? If you want to take her…”\n“No. No, Guildmistress. I am not here. In fact, I should be grateful if you let me tarry a moment…then I will depart. Without interfering in your city or falling afoul of your Council. I know that I am not—well liked here.”\n“Some wouldn’t mind your presence. I—personally think you’re a dangerous distraction. But fine. You have a right to see her. You two are related, aren’t you?”\n“Distantly.”\nMagnolia began to walk for the stairs, ignoring everyone else. A few of the adventurers seemed to realize she was important, but Magnolia really had come like a ghost. She only halted when Tekshia put her spear out to block her. Ressa had a hand on the spear’s haft—and the two, Drake and Human, stared at each other.\n“Is something wrong, Guildmistress? I hope you do not wish to bring up—the past at this moment.”\n“Not at all.”\nThe Drake held Magnolia’s gaze. Then she held out a claw.\n“—I just thought that if you were here, you could settle this young woman’s accommodations. Especially if you aren’t taking her. Liscor is rebuilding, and the Adventurer’s Guild doesn’t take charity.”\nMagnolia’s eyes flickered. For a moment, they looked—\nupset.\nThen she exhaled. She looked about the city, where Drakes and Gnolls were rebuilding. She nodded to Ressa, and the [Maid], expressionless, dipped a hand into a bag of holding and produced a note. Magnolia nodded to her, and the [Maid] scribbled on it before producing a wax seal and her sapphire-silver Runner’s seal.\n“Will—this do? For lodging?”\nTekshia regarded the note and snatched it from Ressa’s hand.\n“I think the Watch Captain will appreciate it. It will keep her from jailing the survivors. Selys, send a Runner for the Merchant’s Guild and make a list of the homes that got wrecked. And the families that lost members of the Watch. That idiot, Lism, might know about children.”\n“Y-yes, Grandmother.”\n“\nIt’s Guildmaster.\nThis way, Reinhart. You won’t take her?”\nOne old, yellow eye, still sharp as an edge of topaz, swung to regard Magnolia. The [Lady] blinked.\nIt was almost as if she hadn’t been paying attention, despite the sum that was making Selys’ eyes pop and hold onto the little card like it was an artifact. She looked at Tekshia—and smiled. This time, the smile seemed as if someone had stabbed her.\n“No. I let my family make their own choices, for better or worse. I do not interfere. Would you think less of me for that?”\nThe [Guildmistress] looked Magnolia in the eyes, then at her granddaughter.\n“I don’t bother with holding tails. I let the young make their own mistakes. It worked with me.”\n“How else would they rise?”\nThe Human woman agreed absently. She followed Tekshia up the stairs to the few guest rooms the Adventurer’s Guild in Liscor had. But she stopped at the door as Tekshia opened it. She whispered, then.\n“—If only I could catch them as they fell.”\nThen she walked into that room and sat down. A blank-faced young woman with blonde hair stared past her. She didn’t react as Magnolia Reinhart sat on a stool that Ressa found, arranging her skirts. Magnolia reached out as Tekshia glanced at them—then closed the door.\n“Yvlon? My dear—it’s me. Can you hear me?”\nThere was no response. Just a blank, blue stare as lost as the sun amidst the clouds. Magnolia glanced at the skin torn from her face.\n“Ressa, can you…? An ointment or something?”\n“She may want the scar.”\nMagnolia’s eyes flashed—then she moderated her tone.\n“A scar will haunt her—perhaps she will want it. But one cannot be undone.\nSomething,\nRessa.”\n“Very well.”\nThe [Maid] fussed around at her belt, then produced a poultice, not a healing potion, and dabbed it carefully across the wound. Yvlon shivered—but it was an automatic reaction. There was no one behind those blue eyes. Her hand was limp. Magnolia sat there, speaking, but there…there was no reaction.\n“Will she recover, Ressa? She looks as Ulva did after Petra died.”\n“I can’t say. She’s tough. Her entire family is.”\nDone, Ressa closed the lid on the jar and stood. Yvlon kept staring out the window as Magnolia squeezed her hand tighter. She sat, hearing the Adventurer’s Guild move around her, the banging in the distance of [Carpenters], and occasionally, watching as Yvlon Byres blinked.\n“I am sorry, Yvlon. I am so…I hoped you would come out of there covered in glory. I did not know. I cannot be everywhere. I should be, but I am one woman. Even now, you will not see me for some time. I am going north. Leaving all of you to your fates.”\nShe waited, perhaps hoping that blank face would turn to her and show something angry. Blue eyes…not green like emeralds, but Magnolia Reinhart spoke softly.\n“You did all you could. You…were so brave. I am sure you were.\nIf I could have—\nI always hope you succeed. You did not need me. That was what I thought. I am an unkind [Lady] of House Reinhart because I always expect it of you and all the others. I truly did think I would see you at a party in your honor. Now, I wish I could stay. But…”\nShe looked north. Yvlon sat there, her blonde hair untidy. Someone had helped cut her out of the remains of her silver armor. She looked perfectly fine for the nightmare she had escaped—save for the scar of flesh ripped from her features. Ressa’s ointment covered it, orange and smelling faintly acrid.\nThe white sheets, the calm, little guest room looked too perfect for the scar. The city, likewise, almost pleasant until you saw how people mourned in the streets in knots and how the smell of dead flesh and the acrid burning of the corpses lingered in the air.\nThe sunlight fell across Magnolia’s own dirtier blonde hair. She did not look like a young woman in her prime, an adventurer filled with dreams of fame and success like Yvlon had but a day ago. Her gaze seemed to be, like the city, no longer as pure.\nScarred. As if the wound on Yvlon’s face were long healed and a figment captured in Magnolia’s stare. All of that followed her head as it looked north. As if tracing a line of responsibility for her to follow. Her voice was low as she spoke, enunciating each word into the small room such that it felt like they left a trail. Echoing.\n“…There are those who did not seek this. Something is happening, Yvlon. I need to seek it out. This time—I can’t be too late.”\nShe gazed back at Yvlon, and her hand squeezed tight on the yong woman’s.\n“You have lost your team. Your friends. This moment must seem unbearable.”\nEven now, Yvlon’s face never changed. But she flinched, and Magnolia Reinhart stood there, her own eyes glittering. Cold, green diamonds. Not merciless—pained, but harsh.\n“You have lost more than you can dream. Yet, and yet, Yvlon Byres—mourn. Weep. Sit there as long as you must. But Izril will demand you to one day rise again and stand. You must. You will.”\nHer gaze sought something in Yvlon’s expression—with such a painful—selfishness. As if she hoped that the young woman’s gaze would sharpen within a day of all of this. But nothing changed, and after six minutes, Magnolia slowly let go of Yvlon’s hand. She rose, painfully, trying to linger—but she did rise.\n“I wish I could stay.”\nThen she turned, hesitated by the doorframe—and spoke quietly to her [Maid]. Magnolia Reinhart looked back once, her eyes lighting on Yvlon’s face a mix of emotions she could not express in mere words. Then she was gone, her carriage rolling north. She could not undo time for Yvlon. So she spent only a moment here.\nAnd still—the city kept breathing. It kept moving as Yvlon Byres blankly stared out the window, seeing nothing at all. People.\nChanging.",

    "text": "It took her two hours to get to the city through the Floodplains. When she arrived, Ryoka stopped and stared a while. She wandered into the city and smelled burnt flesh, walked past destroyed homes, and heard those mourning the dead. She came to the Adventurer’s Guild in a daze, never seeing the pink carriage already pulling out the northern gates.\nShe asked about her friends. She asked about Ceria and Calruz and Gerial and Sostrom. She listened and felt the world drop away.\nThe Drake receptionist took her to a small room with a small bed. She opened the door, and Ryoka sat next to Yvlon for a while. The other girl’s eyes were blank, and she scratched at the scarred flesh on her face. Healing potions could close a lot of wounds. But sometimes…\nAfter a while, Ryoka stood up. Yvlon paid no notice. The girl walked out of the guild and out of the city. She walked towards the ruins and saw the entrance had been blockaded. Twenty giant ant-men stood in front of a wall of dirt, barring entry.\nShe watched them until it was too much to bear. Ryoka left the ruins and walked through the long grass outside of Liscor. She walked until she was lost among the grass, walking and walking without a purpose.\nRyoka never noticed the Goblin that rose out of the grass, following her. She never noticed the large rock that moved towards her slowly. She walked on, staring at the sky.\nShe did not cry. She did not rage. She was empty. Emptiness became her.\nGuilt and sadness was the air she breathed. Death walked next to her and whispered in her ear. Ryoka walked and scarcely thought.\nWhen it was all too much, Ryoka stopped. The Goblin drew a sharp knife from his side, and the moving stone crept up on both Goblin and Humans, unnoticed.\nRyoka took a deep breath. She stood in the plains and\nscreamed\n. The moving boulder jerked. The Goblin froze.\nLarge, leathery birds rose out of the grass in panic. They flew away as the Goblin leapt back, clapping his hands to his ears, and the Rock Crab scuttled back in alarm. The sound pierced the air, travelled miles, and made travellers on the road look up at the sky.\nRyoka screamed until she could bear it no more. She punched at the ground wildly, tore at her own hair. She screamed and screamed until her body was unable to scream any more.\nThen Ryoka stopped.\nHer throat was raw, and she coughed and tasted blood. Ryoka had to sip from one of the healing potions she’d bought before she could breathe without agony.\nShe walked on, despairing. Ryoka tripped over a rock and fell face-first onto the ground. She lay there a while. Empty.\nAfter a while, her stomach growled. Ryoka ignored it.\nShe lay on the ground, cursing it. She cursed the blue sky and the citizens of Liscor and the adventurers. She cursed the undead, the monster that had killed her friends. She cursed the dead gods, the ones she had known, the world she now lived in, and the one she had come from. She cursed all things and especially herself.\nThis is who she was. This is who she had been. Ryoka was filled with that same self-loathing she had gone to the Bloodfields with. But she had come back all this way, survived Persua and it all so she could…\nApologize.\nApologize to whom? They were gone. Yvlon was the only survivor, and she hadn’t moved a muscle as Ryoka talked to her. Ryoka’s tears trickled into the grass. She should never have gone.\nShe should have come back sooner. Ryoka lay there for what must have been an hour as the Goblin with the knife stared at her. She was utterly defenseless.\nThe knife-Goblin looked at Ryoka, then at the distant Goblins celebrating their victory over Skinner. It stared at the little Chieftain, Rags, and then at that broken inn on a hill. All these things the Goblin weighed. Did they matter at all?\nIt looked at the tears falling from the young woman. And the Goblin—put away its knife. He walked away, and Ryoka lay there. Weeping into the grass.",

    "text": "After a while, her stomach growled again. This time, Ryoka listened and sat up.\nShe scrubbed at her face with handfuls of grass and looked around. Evening. She was starving and lost. But when she looked towards Liscor, she saw a building on a hill. When Ryoka drew closer, she saw it was an inn.\nLike the city, it had been touched by death and battle. The inn was cracked in places, broken in others. The ground was churned in places; the soil upturned and grass trampled. An outhouse around back had been smashed in one part.\nEverything had been hastily patched back up. Ryoka eyed the boards nailed clumsily together. They spoke of life, and she was starving.\nShe looked up at the sign above the inn.\nThe Wandering Inn.\nLike the rest of the building, the words were scratched in places, and green blood had dried on part of the sign.\nYet still the inn stood. It drew Ryoka, although she couldn’t say why. Here was a place to rest. A place to eat, perhaps. Or just a place to wait until the pain went away.\nIt would do.\nRyoka put her hand on the door and hesitated. She stared at the half-ruined building. Then she turned away.\nIf her friends had been inside, laughing and celebrating their near escape or even wounded, in need of help, Ryoka would have pushed that door in and come in shyly, begging forgiveness. But they were gone. She had been told this was where they were staying. What was there inside?\nNothing for her.\nRyoka stepped back. Her heart still hurt too much for words, much less mundane company. Ryoka turned, ignoring her stomach. She was empty.\nShe walked down the slope, not knowing where she was going. Perhaps north. Perhaps nowhere. She just had to run. Run, and run.\nBecause there was nothing left to stop for anymore.\nRyoka took out her iPhone and turned it on. She began to walk and then to jog. She made it ten steps before a sound distracted her.\nHer phone began to ring. Ryoka stared at it. Slowly, she hit the glowing green button and raised her phone to her ear.\n“…Hello?”\nEnd of Volume 1\nAuthor’s Note:\nIt has been seven years, I think. Seven years since I began writing Volume 1 of The Wandering Inn, at the beginning of all of this.\nIf it was six or eight, don’t correct me. Seven sounds better. I will be publishing Volume 1, rewritten, on my birthday. With it, I am finally happy enough to let this be printed, and while I have kept the bones of the old story, I have added and tweaked and rewritten some chapters because I am a far better author than I was.\nAll the old chapters will be kept up for people to read if they wish, but this is better. Better because I did not erase what made the old good, but added onto it, I feel.\nI have many people to thank. All my readers for making The Wandering Inn more popular than I could have hoped for. Diana Gill for editing it. My assistant and agent for helping organize all this. And my beta-reading crew and the typo-killing squad, who went through hundreds of thousands of words to make this the best experience possible.\nI do not share much about myself, because I am not much of a public person. I am at my best when I am writing, and while sometimes I’d love to be a public author, I think ‘pirateaba’ is my best side. Writers are not necessarily good at speaking, and fame is like a rabid squirrel. You may want to chase it, until it bites you. And then it never lets go and you’re infected.\n…The point I am making is this. I have written The Wandering Inn for seven years. It is the most I have devoted to anything in my life except perhaps school—and this is one project. After seven years, I am a far better writer than when I began, and I am glad to come back and give new readers the experience the story deserves.\nIt is not perfect, and I am learning. But the web serial continues. We are on Volume 9 and there is a ways to go. I hope I can make it. My birthday is tomorrow. When you read this, I will be old. My time is short and I fear I may not make it to the end.\nI’m turning 30 tomorrow. I was 23 when I began. That’s my pirateaba fact after seven years, and yes, this is an attack on anyone older than me. The Wandering Inn has been an amazing amount of change for me, writing it and learning. Everything that comes after and because of this story is amazing. Thanks for reading, or re-reading, and I hope you continue to enjoy the story.\n–pirateaba\nPrevious Chapter\nNext Chapter",
