Here is one of the Enuryn comics he’s been working on that you voted for! This is a comic that revolves around Nombernaught, a city I’d love to explore personally, not just in the story.
As I wrote in my Patreon update, I needed another week to edit and reorganize what’s probably going to be…100,000 words? I don’t even know how to split it up, much less reorganize some of the scenes for clarity.
They also need to be rewritten because I have dropped multiple scenes–believe me when I say it can be better, but it’ll be a fight to do it either way. For now, please applaud Enuryn’s amazing work and thank you for giving me time.
On that subject, I have a few recommendations for anyone who is waiting for the story. I haven’t had time to read many books yet, my last read being Curse of Chalion and its sequel, The Paladin of Souls, but I will recommend a few other stories I’ve read recently.
The Embodiment of Sins (has nudity, gore) is a story about Goblins. Not what you’d expect and not our Goblins, but I always root for stories with great art and, it seems, huge potential.
The Return of the Mad Demon is the
only
wuxia protagonist-reincarnator martial arts story I’ve seen that even goes off-script slightly (in webcomic form), and it leans into the trope but also subverts it. I won’t give away more, except that I actually enjoyed reading it even later on. I sometimes read or re-read these kinds of stories when my brain needs to be fully off, but I’d never recommend any. This one? Try it.
Mieruko-chan is one I’d expect people to know. I just like it. Stories like these are elegantly self-contained sometimes, not like The Wandering Inn that takes 14 million words and more to get to stuff.
That’s all from me. Sorry for the delay, but I have been told the chapter has bones. Just gotta work on the rest.
