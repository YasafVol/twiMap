I’m still on break! However, here’s a comic from Enuryn to hopefully fill that gap! Paeth is probably one of the most magically advanced civilizations we shall ever meet. I wish I had some of their stuff. This comic exploring a few of their new inventions was fun to work up–there’s tons of stuff that Fraerlings might already have that makes ‘new’ inventions interesting.
Sure, they can make Boots of Flying, but how many and how practical are they? And what Earth stuff do they want to start experimenting with?
In other news I nearly destroyed my keyboard trying to clean it…it seems like I avoided ruining it but even the tiniest bit of water was making it malfunction all of yesterday. Also, I played through all of Promise Mascot Agency, which I can only describe as ‘slice of life yakuza driving’ games much like Yakuza: Like a Dragon and similar series. It truly is a genre of gaming but really, really hard to explain…
Going to be hunting for good stories to read or consume in other ways over the break. I was a potato this week which happens after writing. Should be more active the next.
