I am still on break! But my time is running out and I’m eying my return to work and the fast-approaching end of the year. Have you written your Christmas lists yet? Over this break I uh…
Well, mostly, I just rested up, which I needed and did not watch Arcane. Mostly because everyone and their socks were recommending it to me and I still can’t quite work out how an apparent visual masterpiece with compelling plot and characters relates to League of Legends. Much like how I can’t understand how Cyberpunk’s great TV show relates to Cyberpunk the game. Haven’t watched that one either. Well, I’ll finish watching it when I’m bored.
Oh! I did watch The Owl House and am through all of Season 1, which I liked for the vibes and setting, less so for the plot. But it still gets anywhere from a B/B+ overall and I like the premise a lot. More flaws, but it has something.
Stalker 2 isn’t that much fun, sadly, but then again, I never played Stalker 1. All of this is distractions as I prepare for my writing, but hopefully you’ve had a good week off.
And with that, I present Enuryn’s second comic strip, this time featuring another slice-of-life character in Liscor! But from a different angle! We’ll have one more Liscorian point of view that we don’t normally see, but do you have anywhere else you’d want to go or view from this kind of setting? If so, shout it out! I hope you’re enjoying these break-comics! Oh, and you clicked on the door last chapter, right? The hidden one for the ARG?
Just checking. See you in a week!
