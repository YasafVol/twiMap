(Announcing The Wandering Inn x Aleksandar Mitrovic Limited Edition Fashion Collection! This is a limited run of streetwear
fashion
clothing, produced by an expert [Fashion Designer]!
Check it out now–stocks are limited so if we run out there won’t be more produced!
A huge thank-you to everyone for making this possible and I hope you enjoy!)
I’m still on break! However, I present to you a short story in
comic
form by Enuryn the [Naturalist]! They’ve made a slice-of-life comic about characters and events in the story and we may see more comics if people enjoy them. A huge thanks to Enuryn and hope it at least scratches the itch until the next chapter! Is it an itch for more words? Hunger? Boredom? I dunno…but I do want to write and the break is good for me.
I watched
Tangled
yesterday and it was like the best Disney movie I’ve seen in a decade.
